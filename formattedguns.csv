February 14th, 2007 - ""Currently there is no surefire method of defending the cockpit from a team of terrorists on a plane over the North Atlantic, three hours from any airport.

July 2, 2003 - ""Although pilots would technically be designated as federal law enforcement officers, they would not be authorized carry their guns in ordinary holsters as every other law enforcement officer does, but only in special locked boxes to be kept in the cockpit during flight. Accordingly, the pilots would not be faced with the myriad of situations in which a federal law enforcement officer with emotional problems might an inappropriate decision about defensive gun use-such as when an undercover officer is challenged to a fight in a seedy bar. Thus, the psychological screening used on FBI agents is unnecessary for airline pilots, and is silly in light of the fact that every pilot already controls a weapon thousands of times more powerful than a handgun.""

2," A handgun ban serves to weaken US military preparedness Handguns are an important part of combat. Training in the use of handguns, therefore, is important to the combat readiness of individuals. It is also true that individual handgun owners, whom take handguns to gun ranges and become familiar with them, acquire training and experience in the use of their weapon. The civilian possession of handguns, therefore, increases training that could be useful to the military in the event of a draft. In so far as this is true, any reduction in the ability of citizens to own, use, and train with handguns will reduce the battle readiness of the military.

1,"Historically gun control laws and prohibitions have been applied even at the federal level In 1969 federal legal initiatives aimed at increasing federal control and regulation over gun commerce, possession and licensing.This goes to prove that historically people have aimed at regulating the individual right to bear arms in the name of a greater public safety. The DC Handgun Ban should be analyzed holistically in terms of previous attempts and legal initiatives to control and regulate gun possession.

It's just not that simple.  Even when you think back to the stereotypical Wild Wild West the truth is NOT EVERYONE carried a gun, not even when faced with lawlessness.  Arming society to the teeth just isn't the answer.  />   /> Also think of the parts of the world where everyone is armed now - Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, etc., the presence of all those guns didn't lead to peaceful societies.  The people don't walk around confident no one would dare attack them for fear they'll get gunned down.  Instead the bad guys still make their move, the good or neutral guys hide, and the wide proliferation of guns makes it hard for any civilian or military authority to sort out the good from the bad."

If you want any weapon to be legalised, expect a lot of crime related to the weapon in question."
1," Everyones argument for them seems to be that they need them for self defense out of fear of being attacked by other gun owners.  Well if they were illegalised and strictly enforced, that fear should be eliminated, or at the very least, greatly reduced.

I can understand why people would want to carry them for self-defense, but I believe this would lead to further problems. Guns are dangerous weapons and in my opinion they should be banned. I even disagree with hunting rifles, as these too are dangerous.   />   /> No one should own a gun. Messing around with guns can lead to serious accidents and using them in self-defense could also lead to tragic consequences. If guns didn't cause harm then I would say that everyone has the right to own them, but since they are so dangerous and so many innocent lives have been lost to them, I say that they should be banned altogether."

1," Gun control laws do not work since citizens to not comply to them Empirically by studying cities that have  rigorous  gun control laws  the apparent conclusion is that very few people , percentage wise actually comply to these laws.This proves that people lack the willingness to comply which such regulations and controls imposed on gun ownership .

I'm neither 100% one way or the other BUT I did have to research and debate this topic in college...  />   /> It's undeniable crimes are higher in countries with lots of guns.  Yet there's also a grain of truth to the simple claim that when you ban guns only the criminal will have guns.  What you need is a careful middle ground.  Personally I say 1) Guns should be registered and gun holders should be licensed.  You have to be licensed if you own a car because if the wrong person is driving badly they may kill someone, the same should be true with having a gun.  2) Procuring the gun should require some sort of background check and/or waiting period.  Look if you're truly legit you've got nothing to fear from be checked out or waiting a bit longer.  3) Gun training should be mandatory for gun owners and include awareness of the law, gun safety including lock-up and anti-theft, as well as basic gun maintenance and practice shooting.  If you're going to have the gun you should do it right.  4) Military weapons are for the military.  The right to keep and bear arms does not mean any and every type of gun that can ever possibly exist is yours to have.  Ordinary guns - rifles, shotguns, even some pistols, those are fair game.  But the common citizen has no business owning 50mm machine guns, rocket launchers, armor piercing bullets, etc.  />   /> So, I'm saying ""against"" because I don't think it's as simple as make them illegal.  Instead make ownership of them RESPONSIBLE and add serious consequences for those who are irresponsible.  />   /> And frankly the 2nd Amendment buffs who are going to vent and say no restriction of any kind ever should be on guns are doing a tremendous disservice to their cause.

But why isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to assume that since the framers knew that the way militias were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing a law against militias, but by taking away the people's weapons -- that was the way militias were destroyed. The two clauses go together beautifully: Since we need a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" 
"
2," The individual right to arms is an important symbol of individual freedom The right to bear arms has become an important, lasting expression to many American individuals of their individual freedom and liberty. There are few symbols as powerful, particularly as the right to bear arms for the purposes of, potentially, joining a militia and fighting a tyrannical government is such a tangible concept. The rights to free speech and religion are much less tangible, and lack the power and threat of violence as a check on government tyranny. Such a symbolic expression of freedom resonates too deeply with many Americans to be deprived.

2," The individual right to arms is necessary to a well-regulated militia Further, Tucker writes of the English Bill of Rights: ""The bill of rights, 1 W. and M, says Mr. Blackstone, (Vol. 1 p. 143), secures to the subjects of England the right of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree. In the construction of these game laws it seems to be held, that no person who is not qualified according to law to kill game, hath any right to keep a gun in his house. Now, as no person, (except the game-keeper of a lord or lady of a manor) is admitted to be qualified to kill game, unless he has 100l. per annum, &amp;c. it follows that no others can keep a gun for their defence; so that the whole nation are completely disarmed, and left at the mercy of the government, under the pretext of preserving the breed of hares and partridges, for the exclusive use of the independent country gentlemen. In America we may reasonably hope that the people will never cease to regard the right of keeping and bearing arms as the surest pledge of their liberty.""

"
2," The second clause of the 2nd Amendment is broader than the first The 2nd clause of the 2nd Amendment, which relates to the ""right of the people to keep and bear arms"" (for individual purposes such as self defense), is more important than the first clause, which emphasizes the militia-benefits of a right to bear arms. This interpretation is born out by a historical interpretation of the demands of this past era, in which many individuals owned guns that were not eligible for service in the militia and yet who owned guns and needed to use them for various purposes.

The first clause clearly qualifies any right to bear arms as solely for the purpose of maintaining ""a well regulated militia"" for ""the security of a free state"". 
"
1," If the 2nd amendment was to protect an individual right it would have clearly expressed it If the intentions of the framers had been to protect an individual right to bear arms, they would have clearly expressed this. Yet, the Second Amendment is not at all clear about an individual right to bear arms. The natural reading of the clause would indicate that the right relates only to the first, qualifying clause that states, ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State..."" It is a stretch to read into the language an individual right. If this were the case, why wouldn't they simply have explicitly stated that an ""individual right to bear arms should not be infringed"".

1,"A 2nd Amendment that confers individual rights would be too expansive in limiting government. Oral arguments in DC vs. Heller. March 19th, 2008 - ""One of the troublesome aspects of viewing this as a right of personal use is that that is the kind of fundamental liberty interest that would create a real potential for disruption.

1," An individual right to bear arms cannot be absolute This argument is simply here to remind the reader that no individual right is unfettered and absolute. Reasonable regulations can be placed on an individual right to bear arms. This argument can go both ways in making an individual right to bear arms more moderate, and subsequently more tolerable to both sides in the debate.

"
2," Historically, many US citizens could not serve in the militia but required guns It is unrealistic to believe that the framers of the constitution would, in creating the Second Amendment, limit the right to keep and bear arms to only those US citizens who were eligible for militia service. There were too many US citizens at the time that were not eligible for militia or military service - either because they were too old, too young, or because they were women - whom nevertheless needed to be able to use guns in self-defense against criminals, wildlife, or Indians and/or in order to hunt, eat, and survive.

2,"The way to overcome historical American bias is to ensure every individual has the right to bear arms It is true that American history is filled with violence and bias towards ethnic minorities. However, the path to resolving this issue is to ensure every individual, regardless of class, race, or gender, has the right to bear arms, not to restrict that right to a militia.
"
1," Many US Constitution framers emphasized only a collective, militia-based right to bear arms James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and other Federalists were largely opposed to a individual right to bear arms on the basis that a powerful, centralized government was important. This government was likely to be more stable if individuals did not bear arms.

And I don't think there's any doubt about that. And that's what we're talking about here, are legislative restrictions.""
"
1," The militia was of primary concern over individual rights in writing the 2nd Amendment The primary concern, at the time of the writing of the Second Amendment, was the ability of the militia to aid in the national defense and collective security. There was generally less concern for an individual right to bear arms. Therefore, such an individual right should be deemphasized.
"
1,"2nd Amendment rights did not extend to all ethnic groups in terms of initial practice Although the early American documents proclaimed equality for all and a right for all to bear arms, in actuality, this was not the case. Native Americans, African Americans, and other visible minority groups were not given the same rights as those white Americans who immigrated from Europe.  Lynchings and other acts of injustice based upon racial difference occurred well into the twentieth century, so it is a misrepresentation of the facts to say every individual had the right to bear arms for self-defense.  For much of American history, a large segment of the American population did not even have basic human rights, let alone the right to bear arms. 
"
2," Court rulings upholding the individual right to bear arms Blizz v. Commonwealth, in 1982, held that ""the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire."" Dred Scott v. Sanford (1856) ruling suggested a universal individual right to bear arms, writing ""It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one State of the Union . . .the full liberty . . .to keep and carry arms wherever they went."" 
"
1," Court rulings that the Second Amendment retains only a collective right to arms State v. Buzzard (1842, Ark), Salina v. Blaksley (1905), and United States v. Cruikshank (1875) are among the court decisions finding only a collective right to bear arms to exist.
"
1,"Previous Supreme Court decisions ruled that the Second Amendment does not apply to personal guns Cases such as US vs. Miller that were brought to the Supreme Court have contributed to making significant differences of the context in which the Second Amendment can be applied. In US vs. Miller the court established that the Second Amendment ""did not guarantee a citizen's right to possess a sawed-off shotgun""
"
2," An individual right to bear arms has been championed throughout US history  Throughout the history of the United States, the right to bear arms has been a socio-political necessity.
"
1,"The championing of gun rights has a disturbing historical association with fostering inequality through violence The use of guns and violence is not a necessity, but a symptom of inequality and a culture of resolving conflict through violence.  Arms and violence are a disturbing symptom of socio-political power used by a segment of the population (some white male citizens) to subordinate Native Americans and African-Americans, or to sustain class and gender divisions.
"
1," Assault weapons empower the deranged to kill many people. - While the phrase ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"" is used widely, what it misses is the extent to which assault weapons enable deranged individuals to kill massively. 
"
2," 2nd Amendment conferred a right to defend against various historical threats. Self-defense was a very likely element of the Framers' thinking behind the second amendment. It conferred the right to bear arms for the sake of defending against wolves and bears. It also conferred the right to bear arms for the sake of defending against Indians. Additionally, concerns regarding crime and insecurity were very high in the uncertain first years of the Union, making it likely that the 2nd amendment was also intended by the framers to confer a right to protect against criminals. 
"
1," The 2nd Amendment does not express a right to bear arms for self-defense The 2nd Amendment does not explicitly refer to a right to bear arms for the purpose of self-defense. It only explicitly refers to a right to bear arms for the purpose of upholding ""a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State."" The 2nd Amendment should not be read as conferring a right that it does not clearly confer; a right to arms for the purpose of self defense. Inferences are insufficient, particularly as evidence can be gathered regarding the intentions of the framers of the Constitution that could cut both for and against the notion that the 2nd amendment was intended to confer an individual right to bear arms for the purpose of self-defense. Because neither inference can be definitely deemed correct, the Constitution must be taken at its explicit word, which gives no mention to self-defense.
"
2," The individual right to arms is a lasting symbol of individual freedom The right to bear arms has become an important, lasting expression to many American individuals of their individual freedom and liberty. There are few symbols as powerful, particularly as the right to bear arms for the purposes of, potentially, joining a militia and fighting a tyrannical government is such a tangible concept. The rights to free speech and religion are much less tangible, and lack the power and threat of violence as a check on government tyranny. Such a symbolic expression of freedom resonates too deeply with many Americans to be deprived. 
"
2,"In modern America, the right to bear arms still helps check government power In the modern day, the importance of checking a tyrannical government remains important and relevant, even if the prospect of a citizen militia overthrowing the United States military is now effectively out of reach. There are numerous ways in which an armed citizen can check government power:
An armed citizen can place a check on abusive police power and the emergence of a police state.
An armed citizenry can ensure that government thinks twice before violating the rights of citizens, or that it considers the potential for violence and bloodshed to be an intolerable risk in the violation of rights.
An armed citizenry empowers citizens to protect themselves, so that a big government doesn't have to.
Finally, the right to bear arms is, in itself, an expression of liberty in the face of government power and control. Upholding this symbol is, perhaps, the most important check that the right to bear arms can place on government power, as it symbolically spills into other fields of individual freedom.

1," In today's reality the Second Amendment cannot be applied to civilians The difference in the technology the military now employs versus the personal guns individual civilians can have access to is  exponentially greater than in the framer's time. This means that in today's reality the Second Amendment cannot apply to civilians with the purpose of preparing them to be part of the militia at any day or time.The huge technological advances and military training make it impossible for everyday citizens to be part of a defense force like the "" militia"".
"
2," An individual right to bear arms helps protect against domestic tyranny One of the primary purposes of the Second Amendment of the constitution was to protect against domestic tyranny. The reason for this is based, in large part, in history, but it remains relevant today. At the time of the drafting of the Constitution, one of the greatest fears was that a King-like figure would emerge in American government, or that the government would simply become despotic and tyrannical, like Britain was believed to have become leading up to the Revolutionary war. Hedging against the emergence of a tyranny in America, therefore, was of primary concern. The Second Amendment was designed to ensure that the people were fully empowered with the threat of violence to combat the emergence of a tyrant. This took the form of an individual right to bear arms and to form a militia to combat a tyrannical government.

2,"2nd amendment secures equally the right of the militia and the individual to arms There is no need to adopt an either/or interpretation of the first and second clauses of the 2nd amendment. Rather, it is valid to consider both to be valid. This means that the right of the militia to exist and the right of the people to bear arms for this purpose is legitimate, and it also means that the right of the people to bear arms in a broader sense (for individual self-defense and so on...) is also legitimate.
"
1," The 1994 US assault weapons ban significantly decreased use. The use of assault weapons was down 17% from 1994 levels in 2004, according to one report.
"
2," ""A well-regulated militia"" can apply to a state-run as well as an independent militia The National Guard is an example of the militia of Clauses 15 and 16. But, that does not mean that the National Guard was the sole version of the well-regulated militia described by the Second Amendment. Maryland v. United States does state that 'The National Guard is the modern Militia'. Pro-individual gun right advocates argue that an unorganized militia would be an equally 'well-regulated militia'.
"
2," In order to form a militia, citizens require guns and a right to own them The ability to form a militia is dependent on citizens owning guns and being able to bring them to a militia. If they do not individually own guns (perhaps because they are not offered this individual right), then they are not capable of bringing guns to bear in the formation of a militia. And, it should be acknowledged, that the contingency under consideration is one in which a militia is formed to fight or check a tyrannical government. This means that citizens must be able to form a militia outside of government control, which requires the individual possession of arms. 
"
2,"The 2nd amendment protects the ability to form a militia not the ongoing existence of one  Militias are relevant today as a symbol of preventing tyranny. Historically, the militia that resisted the British was a non state managed association of people that were fighting against tyranny. The wording of the second amendment preserves the spirit of that time and therefore the word ""militia"" can be relevant to nowadays as a symbol of the right of people to fight against tyranny.In this way the spirit of the time is reflected in the letter of the law.
"
2,"If the militia clause is antiquated, than an individual right to arms is all that is left It is entirely possible that the militia clause can have no modern relevance. One of the justifications for this argument is that it is considered unreasonable for citizens to hold tanks and bazookas, which are the only arms that would enable a militia to legitimately check the power of the United States government and its military. It is, therefore, unreasonable for a militia, in the modern day, to become ""well regulated"" such that it could achieve the purpose initially set forth by the founders. This line of logic effectively invalidates the militia clause, and leaves the second clause to stand alone, which secures the ""right of the people to keep and bear arms"". If this second clause is invalidated, then there is nothing left of the Second Amendment that would have any validity in the modern day. As such, the second clause should not be invalidated, and the individual right of the people to keep and bear arms should be upheld.
"
1,"The idea of a militia protecting against domestic tyranny is a myth
"
1,"  2nd amendment cannot offer a right to form a militia when Congress can disarm it Congress has the power and authority to disarm a militia. This is necessary to uphold the monopoly on military force in the state and to protect the integrity of the state. It also should be recognized that a militia could take a form that is entirely ""inappropriate"" and contrary to the interests of the vast majority of the citizenry. Such a militia might claim that the state is acting ""tyrannically"" because it is acting ""democratically"", instead of according to the prescripts of God, for instance. 99% of citizens might oppose the existence of this militia. Is the Second Amendment meant to protect the existence of such a militia? No. Congress has the authority to disband it. If Congress has the authority to disband something entirely, then that thing cannot be considered a right in the Constitution.
"
1," The individual right to form a militia has been eliminated in America In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt passed the Militia Act. This created the National Guard as it exists  today, elevating this militia to a fully state-run and regulated militia. At this point, the idea of an independent, citizen-run militia was effectively ended, and replaced by a more advanced, capable, and useful militia. With this state-run militia becoming the only legitimate militia, it became impossible that citizens would have an individual right to bear arms in order to form an independent militia. No such independent militia is allowable in modern America.  
"
1," The US Constitution recognizes the militia only as an organization of the state The Second Amendment is not the only part of the Constitution that speaks of the militia and its place in America. Clauses 15 and 16 of the Constitution are: ""To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress."" In 1965, in Maryland v. United States, 381 U.S. 41 (1965), the need for a definition of the militia arose when an airliner collided with a National Guard jet. In this ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court wrote, ""The National Guard is the modern Militia reserved to the States by Art. I. 8, cl. 15, 16, of the Constitution."" The militia is ""well regulated"" by the state in modern America. There is no longer a right to form an independent militia to combat the state.  
"
1," No US citizens are in a militia and so none have a right to keep and bear arms The purpose of the Second Amendment - being defined by the ""militia"" clause (""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State"") - is related to the upkeep of the militia. Rights are offered to citizens only in so far as they might enable the upkeep of the militia. Yet, no US citizens are currently in a ""well regulated militia"". Therefore, there is not present context in which citizens would have the ""right to keep and bear arms""; there is no militia in which that context would exist.
"
1," America's modern military makes the militia unnecessary for national security The initial intent of the militia was, in large part, to provide for national security. The concern at the time of drafting the constitution was that the federal government and its military would be incapable of providing for national security. The militia was seen, subsequently, as a means to fill the gaps left by a deficient national military. In modern America, however, it is clear that the military is fully capable of providing for the national defense. As such, the militia is no longer needed to fill in the gaps. The national security context in which the Second Amendment was created, therefore, no longer exists. This means both that the Second Amendment may no longer apply in modern America and also that any individual rights that had applied for the purpose of upholding the militia and national security, may no longer exists as well.
"
1," There are fewer assault weapons at crime scenes since the ban. ""Since enactment of the law, the number of assault weapons traced to crime scenes has dropped 45%, according to Crime Gun Solutions LLC, a consulting firm."" [1]
"
2," ""The people"" should not be conflated to include only a collective right It is false and inconsistent to claim that ""the people"" somehow means only a collective, government-militia right. ""The people"" is consistently used in the Bill of Rights and Constitution to preface an individual right.
"
2,"The Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment confer only individual rights, not collective rights. There is no such thing is a collective right to bear arms? How would it be excercised and upheld? Moreover, this notion that the Second Amendment confers only a collective, not an individual right, is entirely contrary to the purpose of the Bill of Rights, which confers only individual rights. Certainly, these individual rights may be shared universally, but they cannot be divided from the individual.  
"
2," The framers saw the militia as a universal right of the whole people George Mason, the father of the Bill Rights, considered the militia to consist of all of the people, expressing this in Virginia's U.S. Constitution ratification convention on June 16, 1788[4] - ""I ask, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers. But I cannot say who will be the militia of the future day. If that paper on the table gets no alteration, the militia of the future day may not consist of all classes, high and low, and rich and poor..."" This expression clearly denotes the militia as something that should not be altered into an exclusive form. In other words, it must be representative of the whole people and preserved as a universal right. 
"
2,"The right to keep and bear arms must be an individual right. It is commonplace for people to argue against the individual right concept by separating the two phrases of the Second Amendment so that “the people” can then be interpreted to be some collective group such as a state sponsored and run militia. However, if one reads the Bill of Rights starting with the First Amendment, skips the Second Amendment, and reads the remainder, you will see that all of the rights guaranteed are specifically aimed at preventing abuse of the rights of individuals. It would be quite a stretch to imagine the founding fathers would write a document that starts out defining an individual right to freedom of religion, speech, press and assembly; next defines a right that is only collective to a specific group (the militia) and then reverts back to defining the rights of individuals to not have troops quartered in their homes or be subject to unreasonable search and seizure of property.  Therefore it can only be concluded that the right to keep and bear arms is a right secured to the individual citizen.
"
1,"The people"" in the Second Amendment refers to a collective right to arms  Regarding a meaning of ""the People"" in another context, the U.S. Supreme Court commented in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990)- "" ""the people"" seems to be a term of art used in select parts of the Constitution and contrasts with the words ""person"" and ""accused"" used in Articles of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments regulating criminal procedures. This suggests that ""the people"" refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community.""[7]
"
2," ""Keep"" in the 2nd amendment refers to an individual right to bear arms Keep has the connotation of ""keeping"" arms in your home. If we have a right to ""keep"" arms in our homes, than this appears to confer an individual right to possessions and ownership.
"
2,"Why would the framers be so misleading as to conflate ""keep"" with ""upkeep""? If we are to read ""keep"" as meaning ""upkeep"" or maintain in the 2nd Amendment, we are, to some extent, accusing the framers of being highly misleading. The common meaning of ""keep"" at the time was not ""clean"" and ""maintain"", but possess and store. Why would the framers choose to be so misleading? It seems highly unlikely that they would.  
"
2,"If ""bear"" has a military-connotation, ""keep"" can still retain an individual meaning. ""Keep and bear arms"" could mean that the people have both an individual right to keep arms as well as a collective right to bear them. There is no reason to exclude this option, particularly as reference to ""the people"" is given in the second clause. 
"
1,"""Keep"" could confer only a collective right to keep and store, not a personal right. It is possible that the intention of the Second Amendment was for communities to collectively ""keep"" in storage their weapons, but not necessarily for them to keep these weapons in their homes as personal possessions. It should be considered that a keep is noun, referring to a place of safe storage. To keep, then, to some extent has the notion of safe storage associated with it. Thus, a right to keep arms could simply mean the right to keep weapons in community safe storage. 
"
1,"If the concern was to have a militia for national security or to combat tyranny, the collective meaning of ""keep"" would make sense. If collective security was the goal, and the existence of a militia was toward this end, then ""keeping"" weapons collectively would make sense. Why would it matter that individuals keep their weapons in their homes? It's the collective, communal, militia possession that matters.
"
1," Since the ban, there have been fewer gun fatalities. ""Deaths caused by guns dropped from 38,505 in 1994 to 29,573 in 2001, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While crime experts say the drop resulted from several factors, such as fewer gang shootings involving crack cocaine, they cite the assault weapons ban and other gun controls passed in 1993 and 1994 as among the causes""[2]
"
1,"If ""bear"" was commonly taken in a military sense, ""keep"" should also be considered in military, collective sense. The right of the people is to ""keep and bear arms"". It is difficult to separate ""keep"" and ""bear"" when they are structured in this way. It would appear that they were meant to be read in the same context. If we conclude that ""bear"" likely has a military/militia meaning, then it is logical to take ""keep"" in the same vein. ""Keep"" would then be considered part of the militia's ""keeping"" of weapons, rather than in a more individual, home-storage sense.   
"
1,"To ""keep"" arms could only mean to ""upkeep"" them in a collective sense. Some interpretations of ""keep"" have hinted that it is simply to clean, maintain, and ""upkeep"" arms. This could be done in a barracks, in which case, the right to ""keep"" arms would have nothing to do with a right to individual possess. In Parker v. District of Columbia (to be reviewed by the United States Supreme Court under the name District of Columbia v. Heller), this argument was made. 
"
2,"The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated in 2001 that, ""there are numerous instances of the phrase ""bear arms"" being used to describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the ""people"" [or ""citizen"" or ""citizens""] ""to bear arms in defense of themselves [or ""himself""] and the state"", or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage ""bear arms"" was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service.[72]
"
2,"Militia means the whole body of individuals within the US
"
1," ""Bear arms"" means a military/militia, not individual right Relative to the ""bear arms"" meanings, one study found ""...that the overwhelming preponderance of usage of 300 examples of the 'bear arms' expression in public discourse in early America was in an unambiguous, explicitly military context in a figurative (and euphemistic) sense to stand for military service"".[8] Further, the Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles declares that a meaning of ""to bear arms"" is a figurative usage meaning ""to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight"".
"
2,"""Arms"" in the US 2nd Amendment does not exclude personal ""arms"" While it is possible to argue that the natural interpretation of the language ""arms"" refers to a military weapon, it is not clear that the framers of the constitution meant for the use of the language ""arms"" to necessarily exclude an individual right to bear arms.

If you are safe walking in China, it is only because violent criminals are rarer there.And if criminals in China don't have guns, it is not because China outlaws them -- after all, we outlaw marijuana.  No, it's because if a criminal is ever caught with a gun he is swiftly put to death.  (That's probably why you are safer in China -- if they're caught using _anything_ to commit robberies, criminals are swiftly put to death.)Of course, if we put criminals to death with as much fervor as the Chinese do, we could be safe in the streets even _without_ controlling firearm possession.As an aside, I don't think ""Do guns make you safer?"" is the relevant question.  I don't _want_ to be robbed on the street more safely.  I want not to be robbed on the street -- PERIOD!

1," Police support a ban on assault weapons Police, those that have the most experience dealing with crime, are strongly in favor of gun control laws. Why is this? First, many cops have been killed by assault weapons, and these brave law enforcement officers must consistently deal with the fear that criminals they encounter will be packing assault weapons. Second, they recognize that assault weapons are used by some criminals and madmen to inflict maximum casualties. Finally, they see first hand instances in which assault weapons can be used offensively and defensively, and it is notable that they conclude, ultimately, that assault weapons should not be available to the public.

1,"Look at a country such as South Africa. The law there requires that gun owners either store their weapons in government approved safes or that they carry their weapons on their bodies. Based on the opinions expressed here, that should mean that they are much safer than other countries particularly since a large proportion of the population owns some sort of weapon (and most choose to carry since the safes are expensive). The reality is that they are not. Instead criminals assume that anyone they attack is carrying and don't bother using the guns as threats. Instead criminals shoot first out of fear that their victims will be able to shoot back otherwise. The number of robberies that would result in wounded pride and a small financial loss in the U.S. instead result in murder. While I am an American, the only people I know who have been held up in this country have escaped unharmed, while I have known two S. Africans who were killed during petty theft and I have S. African friends who have safe room built into their homes as insurance against home invasions by armed robbers. These are not elitist rich isolated folks who have been impacted by the criminal response to gun laws, but everyday middle class citizens.The idea that many of my fellow citizens are walking around armed scares me more than the idea that some criminals might have weapons. I have no issues with sport rifles used for hunting and I don't have an issue with individuals living in rural areas where wildlife poses enough of a threat that carrying a gun could be considered a safety measure as long as the owners are trained in their use. However, I have an issue with the blanket argument that everyone, everywhere is better off if they own weapons or that all Americans are better off because our neighbors own weapons. The data don't really seem to support this."
1,"""South Africa has a high crime rate because a lot of the people, ie young men under 35 are unemployed or marginally employed. The police outside of the tourist areas are on the take and wouldn't know how to investigate a crime if the criminal fell on them, the whites have little interest in changing anything as they are still on top economically, the rich are interested only in their swiss bank accounts, and the poor soldier on as always.""Other than the fact that I have had rural police in S. Africa be of great assistance to me and I have experienced the frustration of urban cops in the U.S. who were more interested in their own power than helping someone in trouble, I'm not entirely sure how your explanation for the crime rate in S. Africa suggests that the U.S. should be any different. I too am increasingly worried about the direction S. Africa is taking when the current political hero of the day very likely raped at least one woman and got away with it by saying it would have been an insult to her if he hadn't because of the way she dressed (there are at least some cultural differences between our countries). However, I don't think that means that criminals will behave any differently in the U.S. when our population is armed to its teeth. Fear is fear. It can be yours or the criminals' but, oddly enough, the result is the same: heavily armed folks who think it's a good idea to shoot first and worry about the consequences later.(oh, and my earlier comment should read ""safe rooms"")"

The criminals there are thugs who have no respect for human life and have no issue with putting a gun to someone's head and pulling the trigger. In the U.S., if you shoot someone in self-defense, it damn well better have been justified or you're going to jail. Criminals aren't willing to make the jump from mugger to murderer so easily. South Africa is the way it is because of a sudden influx of incompetence, corruption and nepotism after leadership changed. This lead, indirectly, to the creation of all these criminals who don't really have any other place to turn. To get to the point where you're forced to mug people to eat is something you have to try to do in America. In S.A., not so much. "

You could have a law that anyone who resists while wearing the white armband is convicted of entrapment and even murder.  The robbers could seek out victims wearing the armband so they wouldn't have to shoot first.

From 1977 - 1997 90% of all multiple victim shootings happened in states where there was no right to carry. 91% of all defensive uses of   guns   end without a shot fired.There is plenty of proof that guns in this country result in lower crime, especially violent crime.

2,"I'm a gun owner, and a big fan of the Second Amendment.  But as important as this issue it, a battle of statisticians does not constitute an interesting debate.  What has been ignored by both sides in this debate is the history and purpose of the Second Amendment as understood by the founders.  Succinctly:  the right to keep to bear arms is NOT meant to protect us from criminals breaking into our houses at night.  Nor is it meant to permit us to hunt white-tailed deer.  It is meant to protect us FROM OUR OWN GOVERNMENT.  We have complex set of checks and balances in this country that prevent the accumulation of power in the hands of one person (or small group of people).  These checks have worked very well so far.  But in the event they fail, the Second Amendment acts as the last check on a tyranny by allowing the citizens to overthrow the government should it ever AGAIN become necessary.  Remember, this country only exists because well-armed citizens overthrew their government, which had become illegitimate by violating the rights of individuals.  This is an ethical argument, not a practical argument like the one's made by statisticians.  Guns may save lives or cost lives on a day-to-day basis, but disarming the citizenry gives the government FAR more power over us than was ever intended.  And if you think that fear of one's own government is no longer a concern in the 21st century, think again.  Even today at least 40% of the world's population (mostly in China and the Middle East) lives under brutal tyranny.  And even in this country we now have warrantless wiretapping and other abuses of the Constitution.  And although private guns owners wouldn't stand a chance against the U.S. army in a straight up fight, this is no reason to concede the philosophical point that power in this country is supposed to rest with the people, and not with the government.  Private gun ownership is based on a bedrock principle of this republic, and should not be dismissed for emotional reasons, even if it does save lives.  (""Give me liberty or give me death"").  "

What do the armed forces do when they have to choose between protecting the Constitution and obeying the Commander-in-Chief, who is presumably sworn to protect it?

Its a question of knowing when a line has been crossed.  But lines are never that clear.  Look at the war on terror.  Warrantless wiretapping?  Secret courts?  Military tribunals?  ""Detainees"" who are nether prisoners of war nor criminals?  War with no declaration from Congress?  It seems to me that we have crossed a line (or are at least pretty close), but there is hardly any outcry from the public, and certainly no evidence that the military is thinking coup.

1,"As an outsider, I've always found the idea that US citizens feel a need to arm themselves against their government as fairly curious. While I can understand the historical context in which the 2nd Amendment was made, getting my head around the present day relevance of it is difficult. From my (limited) observations, there seems to be a perception of the government as a monolithic ill-intentioned entity that is constantly plotting the oppression of the American people, yet I can see no credible basis for this perception, but perhaps its a cultural thing...From my perspective, government is simply an organisational construct made up of people. People who have more or less the same basic ideas and values as those who distrust the government. It has no will of its own, and can only act through the actions of people. If the people who are acting on the government's behalf are citizens like everyone else, with the same values and beliefs, it seems doubtful that many of them would willingly turn of the majority of their fellows. In my experience, governments are not evil but rather benignly incompetent. When they do harm to people, it tends to be by accident rather than intent. To infer malfeasance from incompetence, and using it to justify an armed populace on the basis of an unlikely scenario eventuating, seems to me to be drawing a very long bow.This brings me to a couple of questions that someone might like to answer for me (or at least comment on):1. Where does the present day fear of government come from? 2. Is it a realistic fear (given the various constitutional mechanisms to prevent the misuse of power)?3. Is being armed against hypothetical government oppression worth all the harm caused by the misuse of   firearms  ?"
2,"Ses asks a few questions:""1. Where does the present day fear of government come from?""It came from a careful reading of history.  Our founders studied ancient and recent (18th century) history, and realized clearly that the most serious threats to life and liberty ALWAYS come from one's own government, rather than from local criminals or foreign states. Think about all the great atrocities of history.  Most (not all) are committed by governments against their own people.  2. Is it a realistic fear (given the various constitutional mechanisms to prevent the misuse of power)? Constitutional republics like the US go a long way to ameliorating those threats.  We've gone 230 years without major governmental threats to our liberties, and have achieved prosperity unimaginable even a century ago.  But complacency is the enemy.  No one ever worries about a fire until their house burns down.  Besides, one of the constitutional mechanisms to which you allude is the Second Amendment.  You can't praise the Constitution and all it's accomplished and then argue that those accomplishments justify changing the document.  3. Is being armed against hypothetical government oppression worth all the harm caused by the misuse of   firearms   ?""This is the true price of living in a free   society   (and it's high).  Many today argue illogically that the price of living in a free society is that we can't be truly free...that we have to sacrifice certain freedoms (like   guns  ) in order to enjoy the other freedoms without fear.  This is a false choice.  Freedom requires constant vigilance, and never becomes something to be taken for granted.  It we must always be willing to pay for it.  The cost of MY freedom is that I must acknowledge yours, even when you do things I don't like with it (like owning guns).  And please remember.  The VAST majority of gun owners NEVER hurt anyone.  To take away our right just because a few abuse that right would be like repealing the First Amendment because some people abuse their right to speak freely.  It would be to treat ALL gun owners as if we were guilty until proved innocent.  And that is anathema in a free society...no matter the practical benefit.  "
1,"Thanks for your reply, SidAirfoil. Having considered your answers, I had a couple of ideas come to mind for your consideration.You said that American's distrust stemmed from a 'careful' reading of history, but I wondered if 'particular' would be a more accurate word, because it seems (to me) that the American attitude to government comes with a set of implicit assumptions attached that may serve to hinder neutral analysis. Specifically, it seem to me that there is an anarchistic assumption at work that attaches a negative value to all forms of government (ie. all governments are bad/government is a necessary evil) and rankles at the imposition of rules on the individual by the state. If you begin with this sort of assumption, it is hardly surprising that American's are distrustful of their government.  My theory (and feel free to disagree) is that a good deal of this distrust stems from the American cultural narrative of the 'rebellious colony that fought for freedom from tyranny', and which views any form of government with great suspicion irrespective of whether that government is malignant or benign. I guess what I am saying is that it seems that the notion of 'government as the enemy' was relevant at the time of the American revolution and the drafting of the US Constitution, but that the distrust of government that was relevant then has become part of the American cultural narrative. It has subsequently been transfered down through generations to the point where it has become an almost irrefutable 'truth' asserted with almost religious conviction, long past the point where the situations that precipitated its invention have ceased to apply.Regarding the value of constitutional republics and their ability to prevent tyranny, I think it is worth considering the effect that time has on entrenching institutional norms and preventing divergence from those norms. To put it more succinctly, the system dictates the behaviour of those acting within the system to a significant degree. In the context of government, each person knows (more or less) what their role is, what the limits of their power are, and that someone is (presumably) watching what they are doing and will intervene if they step out of line. Occassionally, some try to outwit the system, but most of them fail. In the cases where they succeed, it has more to do with the size and awkwardness of the bureaucracy than actual institutional weakness. What I mean here is that it does not automatically follow that the unstable political   conditions   that precipitated the American revolution are still relevant in the present day, where the institutions and practices of democratic government are deeply entrenched. I take your point about the price of a free   society  , but I suspect that your definition of 'free' might differ significantly from mine. Personally, I see the freedom from the danger of random gunfire to be a more immediately useful freedom than the right to have a gun to fight against hypothetical political oppression. The point I am trying to tease out here is that maybe the concerns that provide the basis for the Second Amendment are no longer (as) applicable, and that you are arming yourselves against (and paying the price for) a threat that is largely illusory. Ultimately of course, its a matter that Americans must decide for themselves, but as an observer I can't help but think that the price you pay as a society for your particular brand of freedom seems awfully steep.Finally, one more question if you don't mind. Having considered your comments about freedom and the extent to which government intervention into the affairs of the individual can be tolerated, how do Americans understand their relationship to the social contract? I ask this because Americans seem to tolerate far less 'government interference' in their lives than people in other societies, so I wonder how American's reconcile their individualism with the practical need for social cohesion."

1,"While I find your argument to be much more logical than most of the ""he-man, chest beating"" posts about gun ownership, I have a couple of questions for you: 1.  How do you explain the existence of free nations (Canada, the UK, etc) that have strict   gun control   laws? 2.  How do you explain the existence of free nations that have high rates of gun ownership, but low incidences of   gun violence   (ie: Switzerland)?I believe the problem here may not be gun ownership, but the mentality of many people who purchase   guns  . I come from a gun-owning,   hunting   family with several   police   officers in it. My family members who owned guns were responsible, would never have thought to openly carry a loaded weapon (except while ranching, when a loaded rifle was in a carrier in the truck or horse scabbard), and were safe thoughtful people. The mentality of the people in our country seems to be that of provocation and intimidation. I don't think outlawing guns is the answer. We need to do something about the dumbed down, swaggering, spitting, crotch grabbing idiots whose answer to every problem rests in violence. These mass murders of families and random strangers have got to be stopped. I don't feel safe walking our streets any longer. And that isn't the America I knew, and I don't believe it is what the authors of the Constitution intended."
2,"Consider this:It is Midnight.  Your wife and children are at home alone because you are working late.  There is no phone in the bedroom where your wife is sleeping.  Suddenly, she is awakened by the noise of something smashing.  She sneaks quietly to the door of the bedroom which is open.  She looks out and in dim light she can see at least two persons moving through the living room wearing masks.  What should she do?  Try to sneek to a phone?  Remain quiet and hide and hope they do not come for her or the children?  Personal experience says that she is likely in danger.  The answer?  I say the answer is buy her a gun that fits her hand, teach her to use it should she need to.  You will never know what it is actually like to have this happen to you until it does."
1,"Same scenario.  Your boys snuck out and then snuck back in... and did a piss-poor job doing it, breaking a lamp.  Your wife is scared. She gets the gun out, and sneaks to the top of the stairs and shoots.  You will never know what this is actually like, hopefully...  but this is what happens more often than not.  If you're so scared of someone breaking in, you should buy an alarm and a get a dog.  "
2,"Shooting first and asking questions later is the worst solution. While having a gun safely away from where the kids can get it can be good, it shouldn't be your first defense. "
2,"The wonderful thing about a gun is that it isn't a booby trap or some uncontrollable death machine.  It is a highly controllable death machine.  Say the wife stands at the top of the stairs, levels her firearm at the intruders, and demands that they stop what they are doing and explain themselves.  The boys say, ""Ma, it's me, everything's fine!"" and the intruders either surrender, allowing the police time to get there, they go to jail, and no one gets hurt, or they try some funny business, in which case they die.  Having a firearm is not enough.  Knowing how to use it safely and effectively is just as important, if not more so.  There's nothing wrong with having an alarm, a dog, and a gun."
1,"Aaaaand, in the event that you don't actually hear someone until it's too late, part of being a responsible gun owner is ensuring that access to you weapon is limited.   In my room is a locked closet with a locked cabinet. In a separate closet is a locked safe with ammunition.     I Have to do this because I have a child.  I can't take into account what my child will one day do, even if he appears to be going down the correct path.  At the moment it's even more necessary because of my child's age. My weapons of deer destruction are really of little use to me unless I have pre-warning that someone has entered my ""zone"".  Can I say ""breached my perimeter""? Is that too Sargento of me?   Same scenario... those aren't the kids, they're really intruders, and they're good at what they do.  They are in your wife's room before she even wakes up.  What good is that gun going to do her?  That's why it's the last line of defense.   Buy an alarm, get a dog.  If you're so worried about your family...  suck it up.  Besides... this guy has kids.  You and I both know full well he doesn't have loaded guns.  And if he does, they are securely locked.    It's almost to the point of being useless, like I said.   "
2,"""That's why it's the last line of defense.""That's exactly my point.  A firearm is and should be your last line of defense.  Say you have an alarm, and they get through without tripping it, which really isn't as hard as it sounds, the dog starts barking, so they shoot it, so you pick up the phone to dial 9-11, to find that they've cut the phone line, and now you're up there with no way to defend yourself and the knowledge that someone down there has a gun.  That dog barking would have been enough to alert you to the presence of an intruder, allowed you to open your double locked safes and closets, which to me seems a bit excessive, but I digress, and taken care of the problem.  If someone is good enough to get past the dog, you are screwed, plain and simple, but I don't think even a ninja could get past the dog without making some noise.  Like I said before, there is nothing wrong with having an alarm, a dog, and a gun.Also, you have mentioned yourself that you hunt.  That is a measure of safety.  If a natural disaster were to strike, and you were placed in a New Orleans type situation, you have the tools to acquire food and defend your home from looters.  That is a part of safety.  "
2,If an intruder gets past my alarm and shoots my dog. I'm not calling 911. I'm chambering a personal defense round.
2,"First, I am not using a gun as my last line of defense. I'm using as my first. What are you going to do? Ask the guy who's invading your home for a timeout so you can upgrade from a slipper to a knife, then from a knife to   baseball   bat, then from a bat to to a gun? No, come prepared for the worst, and hope for the best. Second, Silverant, why are you going to chamber anything? You should have it locked and cocked and ready to rock. (Sorry, couldn't resist a little cheese). Seriously though, if you have an empty gun, sell it and get a free rock. ;-)"
2," The assault weapons ban is unnecessary; criminals prefer concealable hand guns While criminals wanted to carry powerful automatic weapons in the 90s, they now prefer hand guns, as they are concealable and yet still have the necessary deadly force for them to commit crimes.
"
2,"Some people cannot afford a dog. A gun is a one time investment, not counting ammunition. A dog you have to continuously feed, bathe, take to the vet, and keeping it alive. Besides, what will stop a robber from shooting your dog, taking away your protection and causing emotional pain(assuming you loved your dog)?"
2,"So the robber breaks in, shoots your dog, you're unarmed; now what?"
1,"Well it depends how redneck thrillbilly you are.....  Most robbers are there to steal stuff and get away with it.  If they get caught it does them no good. If you're a robber and an alarm is going off, AND you shot a dog - now is when you run. Neighbors hear things like gun   shots  .  The second the alarm was tripped an alert was sent out.  The police are most likely already dispatched to the location... if they're worth anything other than the pain in the ass they are where I live and can drag themselves away from stopping people who are walking because ....they're walking.....   At this point, what is the point of stealing anything?  You're already going to be seen...  and most likely if you stay to search the house to kill someone, you'll be caught in the act and possibly killed, too.   The people who are in the house are already aware you're there so they're now either hiding or have the doors locked... which means it will take you longer and more bullets to get to them to shoot them... which is not why you're there anyway.  And if it was.. if your sole goal is to kill someone or ones, you're really effing stupid to have gone about it this way.  If you wanted to kill the people, just walk in during dinner and shoot.  You're more likely to get away with it than tripping alarms and shooting dogs.  If you really want to shoot someone... the fact that the other person has a gun won't make that person any safer, if that's your intent.  It just means it's one more thing that'll be left for the family to decide what to do with after the person is dead.   Having a gun doesn't make you safer. "
2,"""Most robbers are there to steal stuff and get away with it.""  That's true, guess where they can find the jewelry, the most   money  , and   credit cards  .  In your wallet/purse, around your neck and wrist.  If a bad guy is so brazen as to enter a home with an alarm and shot the dog, do you honestly think that's as far as he'll go?  Why not take hostages?  Why not take that pretty little wife, or   god   forbid, that pretty little daughter?  That's a terrible scenario I know but guess what?  You don't have a   firearm   to defend yourself or family.  You are completely at the bad guys mercy.  If he really is a bad guy, then mercy is definitely NOT what you are going to get.  And for your comment on the police?  There's a saying, even amonst the police.  ""When seconds count, the police are only minutes away.""  The Supreme Court has ruled that police aren't required to protect it's citizens.   http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=14766800&BRD=1585&PAG=461&dept_id=213470&rfi=6    It is up to the individual to protect themselves.  So sitting in your bedroom ""hoping"" the bad guy(s) will just go about there business then leave.  Well, that's a pipe dream.  As for me personally? I sleep on one side of the house and my   kids   bedrooms are on the other side with the entrances in the middle. God help anybody who tries to keep me from getting to my kids to protect them.I am completely and irreversibly positive   guns   make you safer."
2,"""[T]his is what happens more often than not."" Can you provide proof of this? This ""you are more likely to kill a loved one than a burglar"" myth is nonsense. There aren't nearly enough accidental shootings in this country to support that statistic. And given the absurd support alarm companies give to their equipment, I think I'll pass. But don't take my word for it. Call the alarm company and ask them how long they warranty their equipment (3 months for the   big three   lettered one). After that, ask them whose responsibility it is to fix it? It's yours, by the way. And as for a dog, if they're so vicious that they'll attack a burglar, I don't think I want them near my   kids  . And I'd rather not pay the thousands of dollars and the years of training to get a dog that is properly trained.I think I'll keep my perfectly   legal     guns  . "
2,I'm what most consider a gun nut (6guns 1000+rounds). I've had three great dogs that have been great supplements to my family's security. They let the   kids   pull their ears and tails. My mut is about 40 pounds. He successfully protected my son and I from two Mastiff dogs. That one day was worth all the   food   I ever bought him. Mastiffs are about 200 pounds each and would have destroyed us. Dogs can be both lovers and fighters.
2,"No, you're not a gun nut.  I have so many   guns   I am not even sure how many anymore.  And so much ammo that it cracked the corner of the foundation in the garage.I love it when people find that out and freak out.  I can only shoot one of them at a time, does it really matter how many I have?  :-P"
1,Dude.  Are you home all the time?   Is this secured?   ...... Do you have a lot of fire extinguishers?  
2,"No, NOYB, and No."
1,"You don't even know how many   guns   you have??? You are not a gun nut, you're just a nut. You are the kind of person who will have the neighborhood   kids   break in, steal some guns, then go shoot up an entire school.I can't imagine that any responsible gun owner would think what you're doing is safe or intelligent.What it the purpose of having so many guns? Perhaps to make up for some other shortcoming in your life?"
2," Assault weapons banned in 1994 were not uniquely lethal Many guns that remained publicly available after the 1994 assault weapons ban were effectively as lethal as the weapons that were banned under the legislation. This is largely because simple adjustments to assault weapons allowed exemptions from the ban. And, it is clear that many of the weapons used in the most deadly massacres, such as the Columbine or Virginia Tech massacres in the United States, were not banned by the assault weapons law.

2,Some people crochet...  Some people build muscle   cars  ...I need not defend my hobby from arrogant and presumptuous sorts.
1,"Not that this is any surprise, but you obviously don't read things fully, nor very well.What good is your gun going to do you when there's already someone in your house with a gun pointing at your head?   How are you going to get your gun then, sugar pants? I have   guns  .... do you think they magically appear in my hands whenever I want them to?  Do yours?  The whole point is that guns do not make you safer.  They are not magic charms that will prevent people from doing harm to you.  They do not tell you the future.   They are a measure of protection that only works IN CONJUNCTION with other things.  With out those other things, your chances of actually getting to your gun go down significantly.  My dog (passed away last winter) never attacked anyone at all.   But he barked at unfamiliar   cars   and people .....   and coyotes....    Dogs don't have to be vicious to alert you to the presence or an about-to-be-presence of a stranger in your home or yard.   Also.  It's not that cool to recommend yourself."
2,"Thank you for your concern, but I am quite well protected, thanks.You have unwittingly exposed one of the fatal flaws in the   gun control   argument: the ""what if?"" You hypothetical situation does nothing to support your position. Given that logic, the fact that my aunt was killed when an 18 wheeler hit her car and it exploded, killing her instantly, even though she was wearing her seat belt, I shouldn't wear a seat belt either, right? Wrong. Because the fact is, both seat belts and   guns   save lives every day. Just because sometimes they don't do it, doesn't mean you shouldn't take proactive steps to increase your chances of surviving when bad things happen.But I don't want to leave your question unanswered. In your situation, chances are my gun would be completely useless. But it doesn't always turn out that way. Ask Tom Jones of College Park, GA, who on May 4 of this year shot and killed one of two home invaders who was pointing a gun at him and his friends. He didn't just surrender his life to the scum who had invaded his home, and saved the lives of 10 people inside his home. But, his gun didn't make him safer, did it? Wrong again.  http://www.wsbtv.com/news/19365762/detail.html  Finally, I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your dog. However, I don't see anything in your statement that would lead me to believe I would be safer if he had been my dog. Cars and people come and go all the time in my subdivision, so a dog barking at those with whom he is unfamiliar would tell me nothing. I have two dogs that bark at even familiar people. Either way, I don't put my safety, and certainly not that of my wife and two   kids  , in the hands (or paws) of anyone but me. Because ultimately, it is my responsibility, and mine alone."
1,"Once again, you're not reading very well.   The question isn't about   gun control  .  The question is: Do   guns   make you safer?    Alone?  No.Guns are not magical things that appear when you need them and tell you the future.  A seat belt is nothing like a gun.    It's like trying to compare apples with soccer balls.  Okay, they're round, but that's about all they have in common.    So you live in an area with medium traffic.   Again, at three in the morning, there shouldn't be anyone in your lawn, nor at your door.  Your dogs barking ARE a great deal of protection, regardless of the fact that they bark at you when you pull in the drive, and pee with delight at the mail man.  Not that I'm saying they actually do.     You're missing the point that without warning - a gun is just another item that is laying around.   About as useful as a shoe horn if you have no way of getting to it BEFORE you need it. That story?  Not exactly gives all the facts, nor are they accurate.  In fact, it's really hard to get a straight story.  One article says they came through the front.  Another says they burst through the patio. Some stories are posted on May 4th. Others later, and others earlier.    Not that it means it's not true.  But how did Tom get to his back pack and open it without arousing the suspicion of the gun-man?   Second, if someone bursts through a patio door at a party, do you think it wise to stand there like cows?   Third, why was Tom carrying a loaded gun around in his back pack where he could just whip it out and start firing?Fourth: If two gunmen separate the men and women and keep them in separate rooms, and Tom walks in to find the other guy about to rape his   girlfriend   - what were the other women doing?  A gun requires one hand, at the least. Of course you're going to say ""Having a gun saved ten peoples lives!!!""   You're going to be screaming inwardly that of course it made those people safer.  IF that story is even true.  We don't know.  But.  What happens if Tom had accidentally left that back pack on a bus?  The very point of having a gun is for the ""what if""s"" according to you, yet this is what you say gun control advocates use.   It works both ways, foamy.  I have guns for entirely different reasons.  They don't actually include the ""what if"" scenarios.  Nor does fear of death rule my life so completely that I ignore what common sense (which isn't exactly common) says and the rules of safety and carry my weapons around with me in a backpack.   Guns do NOT make you safer just by owning one.  Sorry.     "

Just because you imagined that this might be made up doesn't   change   the fact that it did. And all of your questions about why was he carrying a loaded gun, and why wasn't the alleged rapist using both his hands, and what if, and why and who, and where don't change a thing. It happened. It made those people safer, and you just can't stand it. Well I sure hate it for ya.""Nor does fear of death rule my life so completely that I ignore what common sense (which isn't exactly common) says and the rules of safety and carry my weapons around with me in a backpack.""Like you said, you don't have all the facts. Is it not possible that maybe, just MAYBE, he had been carrying it in a holster on his hip while carrying his backpack, and upon arriving at the apartment where none of this ever happened, placed the gun into his backpack? I sometimes do something like that. Is it not possible that in a country of 360,000,000+ people, that two people might do something vaguely similar? And as for fear of death ruling one's life: once again, I refer you to the seat belt example. No, I am not comparing a seat belt to a gun. Thanks again for inventing that little factoid. But an irrational fear of death doesn't have to rule over you to know that it's a good idea to wear a seat belt. You don't wear it for the 99.9% of the time you arrive at your destination without incident. You wear it for that one time - just one - where you don't. It only takes once. And wearing a seat belt - or having a gun - at that one time, MIGHT be the difference between life and death. And if you come out on the other side alive, the seat belt, or the gun, just made you safer."

Good for you for having an alarm and a dog and for educating your   children   that   guns   are not toys and on responsible gun ownership.  Thanks.It's problem that a lot people think guns are some kind of magic charm and make you automatically ""safe"".  It's also a problem that guns are viewed by the   media   and by manufacturers of games and toys as just that - toys and game pieces.    Guns are tools, and weapons.  They can be dangerous, and should be respected for what they can do, both helpful and harmful.    But.  I still don't think they make you safer in this kind of situation unless you have other measures of security.   As I've pointed out - having many guns or a gun won't make you ""safer"" if someone is in your home and you find yourself eating carpet before you even forget what you were dreaming about.   Nor does having a gun make you safer if someone decides to wallop you a good one and jack your wallet, kick you in the crotch, throw dirt in your eyes and stab you in the kidney... or... something.  The gun in bag won't do you much good because it can't see the future.   But.  Whatever.  I have them.  I kill things.  I eat them.  I rescued the cat from coyotes.

In every case of so-called ""accidental shootings"" multiple standard gun safety rules are violated, and in most cases the negligent discharge is performed by adults mishandling their guns while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

2," The 1994 assault weapons ban was ineffectual The sale of assault weapons continued beyond the 1994 ban, but with very slight modifications, such as the sawing off of muzzles, to exploit the loopholes of the ban. Therefore, there was never exactly a ban on assault weapons, but simply a shift in how the manufacturers produced them. And, despite the fact that assault weapons were still being produced and sold, there were still drops in crime and the use of assault weapons on the streets. This suggests that assault weapons were not actually the issue.

Our founding fathers knew what they were doing. They had not only vission but also experience - gun control that removes all guns only makes it easier for the bad guys.

The only HONEST answer he could give to explain his belief - that he should have guns but everyone else should not - is that his life is more important than are the lives of the rest of us.

2,"Was there another point that you wanted to make?  Yes 8400 deaths anually by   guns   in US but 46500 by auto.  So what, I already stated that is an acceptable number.  We also have a higher   murder   rate per capita total with or without guns.  All the more reason to own one.  And the freedom I was speaking of was my freedom to own a gun, which you other nations have lost.  Which seems to have done you no good there in Australia.  I guess since self-defence is not accepted as a reason for issuing a licence to own a gun there -  http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_tot_cri_vic-crime-total-victims  You are #1 just above the UK and Canada."
2,"There are currently almost 7 billion people living on Earth.  Experts suggest another billion in the next decade or two.

It is survival of the fittest according to the rules of nature.You claim uncommitted so I may just actually try to convince you for a minute.I'm saying that if your objective was simply to save lives then you would be spending your time lobbying against autos and   doctors  .

There are more than enough people in the world.  Death is a part of life.  But the only thing that makes life worth living is freedom.Im saying that the only freedom that guarantees my other freedoms is my right to bear arms.  It is live free or die IMO.

Do you think the error is 50%?The bottom line is that this is America.  And we hold our freedoms dear.  There are those who would seek to constantly whiddle away at our freedoms, especially recently.  See Patriot Act.  But there are those of us who choose liberty over this illusion of safety.  And Obama brings broken promises and more war.  Which I oppose!

2,"Michael, you just named 3 countries that don't have the right to bear arms. How exactly did the maintain their freedoms?And you're only talking about accidental shootings. Since   firearms   are illegal in those countries, the shootings that take place tend to be of the less accidental persuasion. I'm not sure what English speaking has to do with   gun control   or the right to bear arms, but there is sufficient evidence that gun control does not equate to less gun violence/  crime  . Take Mexico for example. They have extremely restrictive   gun laws  , and very high gun deaths. And what about Scotland? English speaking yet have the highest assault rate in the ""developed world."" (Scotland tops list of world's most violent countries, The Times, September 19, 2005) And according to a 2001 study by the Dutch Ministry of Justice, Australia has the highest contact crime rate per capita of the 17 top industrialized nations. In 2003 Canada's   homicide   rate was double that of the U.S. despite massive gun control efforts (Juristat: Crime Statistics in Canada, 2004 and FBI Uniform Crime Statistics online.)So while more firearms necessarily equates to more accidental shootings, it also serves as a deterrent against crime, as numerous studies have shown and none that I have seen so far refute.  "
2,"That should have read that Canada's ""violent   crime  "" rate, not   homicide   rate, was double that of the U.S. (Juristat: Crime Statistics in Canada, 2004 and FBI Uniform Crime Statistics online).You are also correct that freedom doesn't stop at the U.S. border. But the U.S. has enjoyed being one of the most free nations in history. It has a long and proud history of preferring to err in favor of personal freedoms. However, this is beginning to change. And it is not a good thing. This is a perfect example. The right to bear arms is guaranteed in the Constitution. And the only reason Brady and their buddies are trying to change that is because they have severe hoplophobia. They believe that either 1) my gun is going to jump out of its holster and begin firing randomly into crowds of little old ladies and   children   or 2) that as soon as I touch a firearm I will lose all ability to form rational thoughts and perceive every word and action as a deadly threat and attempt to neutralize said threat using deadly force. Both are completely ridiculous of course, but Brady and VPC, etc. don't believe that I can be trusted with   guns  . Well I don't believe people who refuse to look at facts and think rationally can be trusted with my rights. "
2," Knives are more deadly than assault weapons Because knives are a more common weapon of choice for criminals, particularly because they are concealable, they have led to more deaths than assault weapons. Yet, Knives aren't banned. It's important to keep the relatively low societal risks in mind.

2,Mexico has much stricter   gun laws   than the U.S. and has a higher   murder   rate by   guns  . How is this possible? Could it be that this is simply one statistic that could be used to formulate an overall opinion about   gun control  ? Could it be that there are other factors that need to be considered? 
2,"This first link gives an overview of Mexican   gun laws  . You can see they have much tighter restrictions on the types of   guns   you can have, more steps to legally own guns, and generally restrict access to guns in general.  http://www.davekopel.com/espanol/Mexican-Gun-Laws.htm  Mexican Gun LawsThis second link shows international violent death rates, and breaks them down by gun and non-gun   deaths  . You can see that despite Mexico's tighter restrictions on guns, they have nearly triple the   homicide   rate by guns (9.88 vs. 3.72/100,000) and more than triple the total homicide rate (17.58 vs. 5.70/100,000).   http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcgvintl.html  While the U.S. certainly has a much higher rate than some countries with extremely strict gun laws - Japan, for example - countries like Brazil, which make it all but impossible to obtain a permit to carry a gun outside the home, have much higher gun homicide rates despite restrictions. So a simplistic look at rates without looking at other factors does not tell the whole story. "
2,"But none of those countries have the same problems with illegal aliens that the U.S. has. It's quite a bit harder to walk to Australia, for example, from another country than it is to walk to Texas. Canada has a much more sparse population with fewer metropolitan areas,  where   crime   tends to be concentrated. There are numerous factors that together all combine to answer the question. "

2,The way I see it--a person has the right to bear arms--especially in his or her home's for protection only.  However a lot of people purchase guns and do not know what to do with them at all.  That is the kind of people  that makes everyone else look bad.  If a person is not instructed on how to use the gun--then they are a danger to themselves and the people they live with.  Remember guns do not kill.  But people kill.  Remember the make my day law???? Anyone--it gives you the right to protect your self and your family as well.  Lets face reality--if a person breaks in to your home with you in it--he or she means business--and you are in grave danger as well---so the only defense would be to have a gun in the house and know how to use it as well. I do not agree with the old cliche--make sure the robbers are in the house and then shoot to kill.  However you can detain them long enough to call the law and have them picked up and put in jail instead---then press charges. As far as guns in a educational facility--I do not agree with that at all.  These are just children that do not have a life line in their stable--and do not have enough common sense to use one correctly as well.
2,"People with guns are not one bit safer - because if someone else knows they have this gun, they can simply surprise them from behind, and suddenly - another armed criminal is loose.  As far as I am concerned, people who apply for gun permits - have already failed a psychological stability test, for wanting a gun in the first place.  "
2,"Does this mean that every police officer who signs up knowing a pistol will be part of his uniform is psychologically unstable as well?Desiring the most effective tools is not unstable, and when the task at hand is defend your freedom and life a gun is simply the best tool around."
2,"How many handgun owners have murdered their own relatives in a fit or because of a paranoid mis-identification of a possible ""intruder""?  These people were obviously pretty unstable to begin with - but they just passed through the filter and got a gun.  The number of these cases - compared with the actual use of handguns for legitimate self defense - looks pretty bad to me, which is why most police chiefs seem to take a dim view of gun-toting citizens.  I have to agree with that view, I regret to say "
2,"I have no idea how many people have had some sort of ""fit"" and shot a relative.  While you're digging that up look into stabbings as well.  After that you need to find out about people who flipped out a little bit and committed no violence.  (I'll help out, I'm in that group.)  Then you get to compare it with the people who didn't even bother to call the police because they brandished a weapon and the threat made itself scarce.I couldn't begin to tell you what's wrong with the police chiefs, but I can share a couple tidbits of information:  CCW permit holders are five times less likely than the ""average"" citizen to be involved in a criminal incident.  The places with the most restrictive controls on weapons seem to have the highest crime rates.  Armed citizens have a much better record than the police regarding the accidental shooting of innocent bystanders.Me carrying a pistol would make you safer, especially if you don't know I have it."

2,"How many gun homicides in the US each year?  A lot How many out of those, were cases for which the victim was known to the assailant?  A lotWhat was the usual cause?

2,"But respectfully, I'm not sure what your point is. Yes, domestic disputes result in shootings in this country. Yes, many victims know their assailant. But 90% of all violent crimes in the U.S. do not involve a firearm of any type (BATFE, 1999). And of the homicides that involve   guns  , 94.4% are gang related (Homicide trends in the United States, Bureau of Justice Statistics, January 17 2007). ""Other common scenarios? Teen in the house knows where the gun is, gets it out, uses it for his/her means of 'problem solving'"" Can you please quantify what you mean by ""common scenarios""? If by ""common"" you mean less than .1% of all firearm deaths, 25% of which are suicides, then yes, that is a common scenario (CDC WISQARS Injury Mortality Reports, 1981-1998). Most states don't require you to register your guns period, so I'm not sure what relevance your statement about that has. I know a lady who, on April 2 of this year watched her husband get gunned down right in front of her. The attacker shot him in the back of the head, then shot his dead body five more times. It took him so long to get out his weapon, then to wrestle his arm free from two men that attempted to stop him that if she had been allowed to carry a gun in restaurants in this state (a condition that was remedied as of July 14th) she would have been able to save his life. And as for the example of your nurse friend, that is a sad story. I'm glad that she was not killed in the incident and I hope she fully recovered from the attack. But the fact remains that over 4,000 people successfully defend themselves every day in this country with   firearms  . For every   homicide  ,   suicide  , and accidental   shooting  , 10 lives are saved through defensive use of firearms. To answer the question posed by this article, ""Do guns make you safer?"" ask yourself the following questions:• If guns are effective enough to be a criminal's preferred tool, why are they not good enough to use for protection?• Why do politicians insist their bodyguards be armed, but not you and I?• If you and your   children   were face-to-face with a male attacker twice your size, what would you do; If you weren't armed? If you were armed?• If guns are ""too dangerous"" to be in our   society  , then why do our leaders want to be the only ones who have them? Do you trust our leaders implicitly to protect you at all times?• Which is better – more   gun control   and the eventual banning of all guns in our society, or not sitting by helplessly watching as an intruder repeatedly rapes your 13-year-old daughter?• If we ever completely ban guns, do you think there would be no more armed criminals in America?• With so many   gun laws   already on the books, why do ""gun crimes"" still exist?  http://www.gunfacts.info/pdfs/gun-facts/5.1  /gun-facts-5.1-screen.pdfSeriously. Take a minute to really ponder those questions. If you do, and you go out and talk to people who own guns and have used them in defense of their lives you will come to a couple of realizations. First, guns save lives. There are too many examples of people using them to protect themselves to argue with that. Second, the vast majority of gun owners are nothing like the picture painted by the   media  . I am an active pro-gun supporter and have daily dealings with others who share a like mind. And I can tell you that they are very aware of and concerned with obeying   the law  , especially when it comes to the carry and use of their guns. Most of us know our gun laws better than the average citizen. We have to because even in states that are generally pro-gun (like Tennessee, where I live) there is a patchwork of different gun regulations and restrictions. For example, it will be   legal   as of Sept. 1 of this year to carry in our state parks, but many municipalities will be ""opting out"" of this   law  , banning guns in their parks. So we always have to be aware of when and where we can and can't carry. And almost all of us obey those laws to the letter. Some by locking their guns in their   cars   before entering parks and restaurants that do not allow carry, and others by just not going there in the first place. There are plenty of other places that are glad to take our   money  .Finally, for the record ""a lot"" does not constitute a statistic. "

2,"In every sense of the word, guns do make you safer, whether it is at your own home, or at a college campus.  I am highly aware of the fact that many people are afraid of the fact that the wrong kind of people would be allowed to carry, but the essential truth that people forget to see is that there are plenty of responsible people that would utilize the ability to carry in order to protect themselves and others.  It is fact enough that crime rate is lower in right to carry states."
2,"The big problem in this country is the dumbing-down by the government schools and the maintenance of that dumbing-down by the totally controlled media.The Second Article (they should never have been called amendments since they do not amend the Constitution that was designed to limit and restrict government) clearly states that the Right to Bear Arms ""SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED"" and that is what all of the liberal, socialist and whatever other title they can be called, individuals fail to accept.The video that has been shown on the internet about the young lady whose parents were murdered in a restaurant rampage by a madman clearly states the fact: The Second Article was specifically designed to protect the state citizens from GOVERNMENT!"

Let me explain.Why am I safer when some walks into a bank and holds it up ?   That most likely won't happen if we have a free   society   where law abiding citizens can carry   guns   without having to jump through a lot of hoops.  But it it does happen, I would be safer because I am a much better shot than the robber, and he won't know that I have a gun.  But if he thinks that there might be some people in the bank with guns and he robs it anyway, he will get what he deserves.When someone shoots you from a highway overpass?  What have you been smoking?  How many instances can you cite where someone shot a driver from a highway overpass?  I think that such a lunatic would get a gun (or a bowling ball) and try to kill or maim people whether there are   gun control   laws or not.  If someone is doing something like that, wouldn't you prefer that I (a law abiding citizen) have a gun to stop this dangerous activity?Middle of dinner?  Ha!  If someone broke into my home in the middle of dinner he/she/it would be swiss cheese in short order.  It would be pretty messy but it wouldn't disturb my dinner.  Ha, it's funny to just think about it.  I can't believe you asked such a stupid question.I don't have a six shooter.  THAT's archaic.  I have much better guns than that.  YES - guns make society safer.  If   gun laws   prohibit gun ownership/possession, then only criminals will have guns. If criminals think someone in their house has a gun, they will try for an easier target.  Just look at the examples of England and Australia.  Their   crime   statistics have DOUBLED since they made their country ""safer"" by severly restricting gun ownership by civilians.  The criminals still have their guns.  That's why they are criminals.  I'll still have mine.  How about you?  If someone breaks into your home in the middle of the night, how are you going to defend yourself?  With a spoon?  Or a broom?  Or are you going to call 911 and cower in a corner waiting for the intruder to find you and KILL you?  I find it hard to believe that people like you can be so illogical.  Defend yourself!

Practice until you are sick of it. Practice makes you prepared. Being prepared gives you the ability to react quicker. To think more clearly. I myself have been around firearms my entire life.

2,"Mass shooting events in the United States have been blamed on the availability of guns. But sudden violence happens around the world. This demonstrates guns are not the  cause of violence. In Japan recently a factory worker and video game player rented a truck, drove it into a crowd, jumped out, and stabbed seventeen killing seven. Here sudden violence is called Going Postal. Most do not know that that name is a Culture Bound Syndrome. The same violence in Malaysia is called Amok. Among the Navajo it is iich'aa. It has been happening for centuries around the world. Subliminal Distraction is a likely cause. The Virginia Tech, Redlake school, Joleka school, and Atlanta Day Trader shooters all had Subliminal Distraction exposure. They also had mental events near the  shooting. SD is known to cause a mental break where it was discovered in business offices. The cubicle was designed to deal with the vision startle reflex to control the problem. Schools are unaware of  the phenomenon even though it is explained in college psychology. They do not offer Cubicle Level Protection or warn students. Home computer use where others can move in peripheral vision are a likely source of exposure. Your subliminal sight in peripheral vision reacts to movement. It does not identify the object. You do that when you complete the reflex, turn and look. Serious exposure begins when you learn to consciously ignore movement around you so you can continue working with out the startle. But you cannot prevent your brain continuing to detect threat-movement. The repeating subliminal appreciation of that movement will eventually color thought and reason. You too can be a victim. Sudden violence is not the only outcome. Symptoms of exposure are fear, paranoia, panic attacks, depression and thoughts of suicide. I am reminded of a saying from the old west. ""God made man Mr. Colt made them equal."" Guns do not cause crime, accidents, or suicides. The issue is not safety. You cannot prevent sudden violence.

2,"The Proper Handling And Use of Weapons - Man's ultimate tool, with a capacity for good and evil almost beyond comprehension, is the ultimate test of maturity and, indeed, wisdom. - AnonymousFrom the time you pick up a firearm, you become a part of a system over which you have complete control. You are the only part of the system that can make a gun safe or unsafe.A firearm is only an instrument. It contains no evil, no conscience, and no ability. It is strictly the intent , competence, and character of its user that decides the outcome of any and all actions taken with it.Remember: no gun can be made accident-proof. A gun is just a machine, with no judgment of its own. It responds to your actions, whether wise or foolish. The only truly effective safety device is the mind of a cautious person who never forgets that a moment's carelessness can produce permanent tragedy.I am a huge believer in the second amendment. I work at a Gun store and I've seen and heard the stories from customers who have been robbed as well as the managers who have been held up. Guns prevent crimes and If you talk to anyone where I work theyll tell you them same.

2,"Living in a rural community, I know the benefits of owning a firearm. Where I live there are mountain lions, coyotes, vicious stray dogs, rattle snakes, and numerous other animal threats. I would rather have the comfort of having a firearm on my person or close by, than to have a knife or some sort of blunt object (Granted I have killed a rattle snake with a large rock before). In regards to protection from people same thing I feel safe knowing that I have a firearm that is readily accessible if needed. I live by a few rules when it comes to owning and using a firearm. Assume it is always loaded, do not aim it at anything you do not intend to kill, and only use it as a last resort. I do believe in gun control, but only in regards to Assault Rifles, fully automatics, and Maximum Magazine capacity. Assault rifles and fully automatics were designed with one purpose in mind, to kill people. Maximum magazine capacity, is in regards to the saying ""bullets do not discriminate,"" the fewer rounds, the less likely to have any collateral damage. Limiting magazine capacity should be directly related to the Caliber/Gage of the fire arm. By this I mean the power behind the projectile. A 9mm has substantially less stopping power than a .357, and that less than a .45. Shotguns although they may be more powerful at close range, should be limited as little as possible. The reasoning behind this is, if all you have is a shotgun, and the person is at a distance, I would rather hit them several times, before they become within lethal range. Mainly because being peppered by a shotgun, in my opinion, would make many people think twice about coming any closer. Although I do Support owning firearms, I also do support proper storage and personal safety precautions. Such as trigger locks, Safes, and storing them unloaded. These are all good precautions because if someone breaks into your house, and your weapons are not secure they can be used against you and your family, just as easily as they can be used for protection."
2,"  Assault rifles are no different than any other   firearm  . With the exception of appearence. As far as fully automatic weapons go, the only way you can legally own one is to have a federal   firearms   liscense. Which envolves a background check, inspections, properly secured storage, and a nominal fee. Maximum capacity magazines are irrelavent. It's just that much more   money   you send down the barrel when you shoot. When you start talking about banning certain firearms, you leave the door open for other things. High capacity leads to bullet type. appearance leads to caliber. Pretty soon, your down to the pump shotgun and rimfire. If you haven't seen or heard about all of the anti-gun legislature, that is their sole purpose. COMPLETE DISARMAMENT. And anyone that can think for themselves knows that when a   society   can no longer defend themselve from tyrannicle government, freedom and liberty are no longer. Don't let it happen. Your classic styled   guns   or a weekend plinker using an AR type rifle. It's all the same to them."
2,"The police have no legal obligation to protect you or your loved ones. When the chips are down, you need to protect yourself, or allow yourself to be killed.No one...no one...is going to deprive me of one minute of   existence   on this Earth. No one will take *my* life, or the life of my loved ones.I choose to defend myself with a   firearm  . Let those who would take that away from me to come over to my house and live with me 24x7 and protect me from bad guys...who will *always* have access to   guns  ...even if we rounded up every gun from every household in the USA and dumped them into the ocean. Bad guys will *always* find a way to have guns, and use them against us."
1,it is possible depending o how you use the gun it may get you killed because it might make you look threatning to someone else and then they could shoot you whereas it might be a good way to protect ourselves 
2,"Sure, I guess what you are saying is possible.  If I have a gun and I stick it in the perp's face, he may think he is being threatened and react violently.But that would be the last violent reaction he would ever make.What?  Am I supposed to just cower in a corner and let the perp do whatever he wants to do to me and my family?Hell NO!"

2,"Safer from criminals or safer in protecting our freedoms? In plain and simple words, the Second Amendment allows American citizens the option of overthrowing a corrupt government if the need ever arises. The Founding Fathers saw how England tried to disarm the Colonials in order to control them. The wanted to ensure that American citizens would always have the right to own and bare arms, thus the words, ""..shall not be infringed"". The government should always fear the people, not the other way around. Other checks and balances were written in the Constitution for the people to use, but the Founding Fathers knew from experience that only citizens with   firearms   could truely be free. There are many elected people today that would have been hung for treason in the late 1700's. Many citizens today are fed up with the government restricting their freedoms. Treaties being made that are not in accord with our Bill of Rights and laws create ""permits"" and ""licenses"" to exercise our Rights go against preserving our freedoms. Laws are needed to punish citizens who abuse their Rights. Not laws that punish citizens for exercising their Rights. We've seen a great increase in firearm and ammuniton purchases. I don't believe that people are in fear of   crime   as much as loosing their freedom. I honestly believe that any new laws that restrict or limit the Right to bare arms will cause a second Revolutionary War. These anti-Second Amendment people know not what they do."
2, i believe that as long as criminals roam the streets with   guns   it is our right as   law   abiding citizens to protect ourselves against being made into a victem and as long as someone has something someone else wants the potential of   crime   is real its human nature and has nothing at all to do with living in the states or   china   or the north pole.If every person had a pistol on thier side walking down the street than the crime rates would drop not go up .Why would a criminal attack me for my wallet or kidnap my son if there was 20 guns in his face when he turned around? 
2,"""Peace comes through laws""? Come on. There are hundreds of laws on the books regarding   guns  , yet they do not prevent gun crimes from happening. In contrast, gun ownership in this country is at an all time high. In 1986, only six states allowed you to carry a gun. Today 48 allow at least limited carry, with about 40 allowing most   law  -abiding citizens to carry. And   murder   rates are at a 35 year low. And there are over 4,000 defensive uses of   firearms   every day in this country, so the reality doesn't match your implication that guns don't protect you. "
1,"But it is no guarantee that you will survive an attack.  Gun ownership, as I see it, creates a false sense of security, regardless.  There is no guarantee that the homeowner with a gun will survive a home invasion, if criminals break into his residence.  Crime rates are far lower in countries that do not allow citizens to own handguns (however, they may own hunting weaponry).  I believe that the rising   crime   rates from   guns   in Canada are the results of organized crime and the increasing   drug trafficking   in that country.  Still, Canada has a far lower per-capita handgun   murder   rate overall than does the United States, since Canadians do not have an automatic guarantee to bear arms.   I do not believe that the writers of our   U.S. Constitution   meant for the Second Amendment to allow anyone unlimited unchecked access to   firearms  , but they did intend for citizens to freely protect themselves during times of war, especially at home.  The numbers of handguns and firearms severely outnumber the entire population of our country, and that's a very chilling thought.  It is time for some kind of change.       "
2,"""But it is no guarantee that you will survive an attack.""And if unarmed, you can almost certainly guarantee that you won't.

There are over 1.5 million defensive uses of   guns   every year, and in 91% of them not a single shot is fired. Merely brandishing a handgun has therefore been proven to be an effective deterrent against   crime  .""Crime rates are far lower in countries that do not allow citizens to own handguns[.]""What about Mexico? Are you implying that Mexico has a lower crime rate than the U.S. They have much stricter   gun control   laws than the U.S. but a much higher crime rate. Or what about Switzerland? Gun ownership there is very high, yet the   homicide   rate is relatively low. The countries that the anti-gun lobby uses as examples are countries, like Japan, that don't have a long history of gun ownership anyway, unlike the United States. According to the U.N. Scotalnd was the most violent developed country, with assault three times more likely than in the U.S.""I believe that the rising crime rates from guns in Canada are the results of organized crime and the increasing   drug trafficking   in that country.""And despite similar trends in the U.S. crime is at a 35 year low here, while gun ownership is at an all time high. Coincidence? Maybe, but the FBI's crime statistics suggest otherwise. In their survey of all 3504 counties in the U.S. crime is shown to be significantly lower in counties that have few restrictions on gun ownership and carry.""I do not believe that the writers of our   U.S. Constitution   meant for the Second Amendment to allow anyone unlimited unchecked access to   firearms  [.]""Those who have studied the writings and lives of them disagree.

The fundamental   law   of the militia is, that it be created, directed and commanded by the laws, and ever for the support of the laws.""         ---John Adams, A Defence of the Constitutions of the United States 475 (1787-1788) I could go on, but you get the point.""The numbers of handguns and firearms severely outnumber the entire population of our country, and that's a very chilling thought.""Yes, it is chilling to me how 280 million (estimated number of guns in owned in the U.S.) outnumbers over 360 million (estimated number of people in the U.S.). Chills me right to the bone in fact. Even more chilling is the fact that 60-65 million homes have guns. And yet there aren't 60-65 million   shooting   deaths every year. Chilling. Brrrrr. Do the research and you will see that guns in America do make you safer. No amount of emotional arguments or skewing of statistics, or even outright lying by the Brady Bunch, the antiFreedom States Alliance, or the aptly names Violence Policy Center will change that. "

2,"The first article is a very good, unbiased presentation of facts about   guns   in general. It does a pretty fair job of just laying out a few facts without trying to push an agenda either way. I have had it bookmarked for quite some time. In it, they use the smallest finding among 9 studies that show at least 764,000 defensive uses of guns per year. It also states that in 1995 there were a total of 1,400 accidental   firearms     deaths   of persons of any age. Now, assuming (incorrectly, but for the sake of argument) that every single one of those accidental deaths was someone being shot with their own gun, that would still mean you were more than 11 times more likely to be killed by someone else than shot with your own gun. And that is all homicides (16,400). 70.3% of all homicides in 2004 were killed with guns (11,529). (See links below)And that is leaving out attempted murders, which you also included. If you want to include attempted murders (described as aggravated assaults by the FBI studies linked below) then you're talking a whole new ball game. Now the number (  murder   + attempted murder) skyrockets to over 870,000, meaning that you are now over 600 times more likely to be killed or have an attempt on your life than to be shot with your own gun (again, assuming that all accidental gun deaths are someone being shot with their own gun).  http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/violent_crime/murder.html    http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/violent_crime/aggravated_assault.html  The second link you provided didn't really address the question, so I won't make any comments one way or the other about the information in it, if that is OK with you."

The NSPOF-based estimateof millions of DGUs each year greatly exaggeratesthe true number, as do other estimates based onsimilar surveys.

2,"My wife and I were sitting at home watching tv one evening when we noticed something moving outside of our living room window.  As we continued to sit there, we noticed that there were two men looking in our living room window.  They looked in and then moved away.  It was not long until they were back.  This time they stayed watching for a longer time.  I picked up the phone, dialed 911.  The operator told me that it would be 15 to 20 minutes before an officer could get to our home.  Not knowing what was to come, I went to the bedroom and got the shotgun.  When they came back the third time, I leveled the shotgun at the window.  I did not fire.  However, they did leave and did not come back.  Later that night, they broke in and raped a women a couple doors down from us.  Do I believe in guns saving lives?  Yes, I do.  "

""In other words, virtually all the victims were NOT murdered with their own guns!   They were killed “by intruders who brought their own guns to the victim’s household.”"" Alas, the victims would have been better off having a gun to protect themselves. """
2,Define the law that would keep guns out of the hands of intruders[criminals]!!!!
2,The article clearly states the high number of lives saved by   guns  .  Yes it is unfortunate that having a gun does not guarentee you will survive but it definately improves your chances.And there are laws that attempt to keep the guns away from criminals but that is what makes them a crimianl now isn't it?  
2,     I really can't understand how so many can be so mislead. Simple fact tells us that when you remoive   guns   from   society   violent   crime   increases and when guns are allowed violent crime decreases. If you need more information than that I feel sorry for you.
2,"I have to agree on a waiting period. It is sad that deaths occured because of it, but without, it ANY nut case cold just walk in a buy a hand gun. Yes, I know that a person can buy a long gun without waiting "
2,"A background check is different than a waiting period--I agree with reasonable background checks, but in most cases that can be done by phone in a few minutes, without a significant wait.  A wait inconveniences the law abiding--I'm allowed to carry a gun, and I already own several.  There is no gun shop in my town.  A waiting period would mean that if I wanted yet another gun, I'd go to the gun shop, almost certainly while carrying one of the guns I already own, pick out my new gun...then I'd have to drive back to the shop once the wait was over.  If I see a bargain while I'm visiting the other end of the state, I essentially have to pass it by.  Waiting periods may have made some sense for first-time buyers before technology made instant checks possible.  "

2,"Here in Texas if you have your concealed handgun license, you can buy a hand gun with no waiting period. The reason for the waiting period is so some guy all pissed off at his woman has time to cool down before he blows her brains out in a fit of rage. I like the waiting period, I believe it prevents such things from happening. I know, if he wanted to he could beat her brains out with a baseball bat, but that's not as easy as just pointing, and pulling a trigger."
2,"I really can't imagine a situation where someone who is unstable enough to think that shooting someone is a good idea, but stable enough to maintain a criminal history clean enough to legally buy a gun, and who doesn't own a gun and is mad enough to  go find a gun store, pick out a gun (without appearing to be a nutcase to the gun shop people) spend a couple hundred dollars, fill out the NICS 4473 form, wait for the background check, then go back and find the person they are mad at and shoot them....but not so mad that they wouldn't still want to shoot them a couple days later.   Is there  evidence that people with clean criminal backgrounds commit murder with guns they have bought at a licensed gun dealer in the last 10 days in any statistically meaningful numbers?  On the other hand, I've seen stories of someone who needed a gun to protect against a nutcase, but was killed before the waiting period was over.  Thankfully a rare situation, but more common than what a waiting period is theoretically supposed to protect against. "
2,"Ironman- respectfully- I disagree.As Sevesteen pointed out- purchasing a firearm is a relatively intense process. By me for instance, to purchase a firearm (handgun specifically) I must go, pay for the firearm, pass my NICS check upon completion of my 4473, receive a green certificate, drive to the pistol licensing unit, turn in the ticket and have my permit amended to reflect the additional handgun, then go back and show my dealer that the pistol is now, in fact on my license. Only then can I take possession of the firearm.As a result of working within so many constraints- this often takes several days to accomplish, and as the Licensing unit by me is small, people often are required to miss work to accomplish the task. The hours do not even run a full business day, and are open 4 days a week instead of 5.Waiting periods, and additional steps like the ones I described to not deter the mentally deranged, as you described. Those people are committed. They are, for lack of a better term, fanatical.People who do get deterred are good, everyday Americans who want to take up handgunning for sport or protection. Many people do not have the luxury to miss multiple days of work to get to a gun shop prior to close, or afford any other such time consuming activities.With these waiting periods, we simply punish the honest and the good."
2,"So, this ""waiting period"" stops a guy from murdering his wife how if he already owns guns? And the ""waiting period"" would certainly not help the wife unless the murderer was nice enough to wait until she got her gun home before he attacked her.This waiting nonsense is another feel good but idiotic idea with no basis in logic or fact. Good people have no desire to harm others. Criminals do not obey laws or care whom they harm - and they don't get their guns from a shop or jump through any of the hoops honest people are forced to put up with.  As the survivor of an attack, I know without any doubt that I would have been dead a long time now if I had not been armed and ready to shoot. I am now a certified NRA instructor for handguns and self defense. I spend a great deal of time helping other women (and men too) understand how to defend themselves, both armed and otherwise. I have no desire to ever harm anyone, but I will never be a helpless victim. My life is worth preserving."
2,"I must  be fair- I don't like the use of anecdotes in arguments regarding legislation.  At most they should serve as exclamation points at the end of statistical analysis. If we rely on anecdotes, this argument can go on indefinitely. An easier way to look at this, I think- would be this:If immediate access to guns didn't save lives, we wouldn't arm our police. Sure the counter-argument may be 'but police are trained'. Do not underestimate the vigilance of everyday Citizens to stay sharp and proficient in firearms handling.  Many states require lengthy classes and courses of fire to prove the shooters ability to not only understand the law, but to prove competence."
1,"I've seen statistics, research, and anecdotes supporting both sides of the debate, so until there's real proof one way or the other, it comes down to what you believe.  I happen to believe that guns do not make us safer, in general, but because the evidence is ambiguous, and because the Constitution protects our right to bear arms, I oppose overly restrictive bans on firearms.Ah, so what do I mean by overly restrictive?  I think a person ought to be able to have a handgun in their homes.  Sports enthusiasts ought to be able to shoot targets at firing ranges.  And hunters ought to be allowed to have rifles and shotguns.But I just don't understand extreme right-wing objections to things like background checks.  Of course we'll never completely prevent criminals from having guns, but at least we can make it hard on them.  We could devote our political energy to a lot more important things if we could just agree on some reasonable compromises here.  All you gun rights supporters, get over your fear that all your rights will be taken away, and accept a few reasonable restrictions.  And all you gun rights opponents, accept that guns in the hands of ordinary citizens aren't going to go away completely, just like drinking didn't go away during Prohibition.  And let's get on with things like, I don't know, figuring out how to reduce the national debt."
2,"Dmonasgevery gun purchased in the US from a gun dealer or gunshow has a background check associated with it through the FBI NICS background check and a form 4473. What we the gun extremists, disagree with is increasing the national debt to fund programs that have never lead to a conviction and have cost nearly half a billion dollars, like oh, say, ballistic fingerprinting. nearly 500 million dollars- to show . . . .nothing. That could have funded a lot of schools to save some of those people from a life of crime they failed to prosecute with that waste. we don't oppose reasonable things- we oppose stupid things, and unfortunately- thats all that has been put forth. Stupid stuff- like a ban on barrel shrouds, proposed by Sarah Brady. You know what a barrel shroud does? it acts like a heat sink- just like on the processor of your computer. it helps cool things down. Gun powder burns hot (big surprise there I know)why ban something that provides such a function? the answer is stupidity. Many politicians try to play on the lack of information of non-gun owners, make false statements and create straw man arguments to things that aren't a problem.Gun control is very rarely about guns, and far more often about control."
1,"Some of your examples make perfect sense. Banning barrel shrouds seems excessive. Perhaps you are not a gun extremist, after all, just a reasonable gun enthusiast.  But what about one of the more key provisions of the lapsed 1994 federal assault weapons ban - what's so wrong about banning private use of clips with more than 10 rounds?  And with respect to gun shows, it's true that licensed dealers at gun shows must conduct background checks, but individuals not routinely involved in the gun trade ARE allowed to sell their guns without conducting background checks.  It is certainly possible to place additional restrictions on private sellers at gun shows, and thereby to reduce the availability of guns to criminals, etc., without invading private homes.  Yes, illegal gun sales would still occur, but it would be harder.You say you only oppose stupid stuff, and I applaud you for that.  But there are plenty of advocates who oppose all restrictions on gun ownership, just in principle.  That stifles healthy debate, just as much as those who support every restriction they see without thinking about whether it's stupid."
2,"Dmonasgprivate sales between persons are a horse of a different color. I must admit I don't purchase firearms from private individuals, just because I like to have a warranty with products.The capacity thing I disagree on, but I can see where you are coming from.  There are a lot of gun games that require higher capacity weapons, and also there have unfortunately been a number of civilian involved shootings where a person had to fight off, for lack of a better term, multiple attackers.if you look at a lot of the guns used in crimes, many can't even hold more than 10 rounds. A lot of the handguns used for crime are just not in that category.we'll come back to capacity restrictions in a minute-I agree, some people on my side of the fence are a bit right of 'hard liner' with some of their views. Their thought process, or the thought process of some of the ones I've encountered, is as follows:'death by a thousand papercuts' progressively more and more little bits of legislation to limit and price out many members of society from firearm ownership, until they have been forced to exist as a small minority- where they no longer have their rights respected.many of those hard liners look at Australia and Great Britain, countries where legislation was increased, steadily for years, and then all of a  sudden, their rights were stroked away with a single move of a pen. Overall violence in both countries went up after those pen strokes.they are so fearful of being boxed into a corner that they lash out at any legislation.I hate to make this reference, but it is one worth repeating. So I apologize in advance. Nazi Germany had gun laws that basically broke down as follows- you could own weapons for hunting, and you could store them at your local police station. To many, that sounds REASONABLE. some would say that its not a bad idea to have laws like that here.we are obviously NOT nazi Germany; however, none of us can read the future. we don't know what rights our kids, our our grandchildren may need to be happy and healthy in our society. This goes beyond guns too. If we allow guns and the 2nd amendment to be gutted, we set precedent for the WHOLE bill of rights to fall under scrutiny.I'm not against background checks- I think they are a great thing. The capacity ban I think is silly, just because most encounters and shootings in the civilian world happen with less than 5 rounds- its somewhere on the FBI website, but you can check.so why limit something that isn't a problem?A lot of people say, well what about that bank of America robbery in California? that was a terrible tragedy, where 2 crazy guys did some serious gun smithing and black market dealing to get some heavy weaponry.but what ended it? Police, taking civilian legal guns (ar-15s) and putting the shooters down. what was the response of California? ban civilians from owning the types of rifles the police took from a gunshop to stop the gunmen.The problem I think, is that most of these legislators are more concerned with hype and votes than understanding the issue- so they put a lot of stuff together that sounds big and bad- and try to ban it. Alls that ends up doing is punishing law abiding citizens. Even if i don't agree with a law, I still obey it. we are paying the price for their lack of diligence, and we pay it with our rights and our tax dollars.The other problem is, much of the reasonable measures you talk about, get unreasonable things tacked on to them. Sure background checks are legal, but what was the fat stuck on that bill? what else were we forced to sacrifice to get one good thing?thats more of a line veto question, but think of some of the laws that aren't gun related, that have passed regarding your hobbies. how much of it could have been better for citizens if the legislators really understood the subject, instead of focusing on what sounded big? what sounded good?I think you make good points, but I think the price for some of the reasonable things comes with a higher price tag than many expect. for instance- the brady campaign has a big push to oppose a bill right now- saying it would make it legal for children to walk the streets of DC with assault rifles.if you read the bill, it basically undoes the unconstitutional ban, as ruled by the Supreme Court, in washington DC.Don't forget also that DC, or Phili- these are cities with the tightest and most restrictive gun laws. yet they have the most violence. if that doesn't prove that much of this legislation is wasted, I don't know what does."

1,"There are adequate alternatives to assault weapons for self-defense. A shotgun, pistol, or rifle are all adequate means of self-defense. These are powerful weapons with heavy destructive force. They can easily kill multiple assailants in rapid succession when used properly. If there is any concern about the ability of a gun owner to wield a shotgun or pistol properly such that they can kill multiple assailants, than they should seek enhanced training instead of an assault weapon.

However, if you have access to such a study, can you please provide it here? I will personally forward it to the Brady Campaign if you can. On the other hand, there are plenty of studies that show a reduction in crime in areas where handgun carry is allowed. So to say that the evidence is ambiguous is a misrepresentation of the facts. And in general I agree with your statement on anecdotes. But they do serve to emphasize a point. I guess you said that though, didn't you? ;-) Good closing statement too. "

So I'd like to see honest statistics showing whether owning and keeping a handgun makes you safer.This has nothing to do with the question of whether it is your right to oown a handgun.  The current   legal   opinion is that you do.  This could, of course, change. In the past, many Supreme Court decisions have been reversed.  This recent decision seems very questionable.Note that if you do have in your home a handgun, and a burglar enter, he/she will ""have the drop on you"".  He may not shoot you if you dont show him your gun. but he surely will if you do.So I urge you not to have a handgun.  A   sports   rifle is a different matter.I also see it as being more effective to show people that having a handgun only gives you a false sense of security.  In real life, it will not help.  This approach is likely to be more effective than trying to pass legislation, which might require changing the Constitution.GKM"
2,"Yes I feel safer because I am safer. I have used my gun on more than one occasion to prevent theft, assault and who knows what else had I not been armed. In all cases I did nothing to provoke anyone, never fired a shot and no   children   died from my weapon.  In ""real life"" just having the weapon is enough of a deterrent.  In cases when I did not have a weapon it resulted in a physical altercation sometimes resulting in injury.Typically a burgler would make some type of noise entering your home.  Unless you welcome him in by leaving the doors and windows unlocked.  I could never imagine a situation where anyone woud ""have the drop on me"" ever, especially in my own home.  And having a gun in my home is no more dangerous than any other tool.  "
2,"Accidental injury and/or death from a handgun usually is the result of improper handling.  Quite frankly, if you are handling a firearm and not using the standard safety techniques, you're asking for trouble.The gross majority of legitimate gun owners respect the potential of their weapons, and things like that don't happen.  The few who don't, however, are the ones who make the news for being stupid.  I'd rather not be lumped in with them.  I know what I'm doing with mine.In real life, having a handgun DOES help.  There have been many stories of defense from a handgun that would not be afforded by any other means.  I just read an article about a man who was stalking a woman for over a year.  She bought a gun.  He broke in.  She called 911 and hid in her bedroom, and he broke down the door.  He then tried to strangle her, and then HIS funeral was planned for that weekend.  Without the gun, it would have been hers.As for the right to own a handgun, that will never   change  .  Or, better yet, if it does, it will very literally cause an armed rebellion.  The whole purpose of the   second amendment   was to protect us against the tyranny that government can bring.  It is the last defense of the people against the government.  Take that away, and the second American revolution starts.  "
2,"I am a   military   man (retired)   guns   have never killed unless used by a person. Outside the line of duty I have used a weapon two times. NEVER fired it, just seeing that the opposition was armed stopped both attempted assaults. I have a half century in military and /or   law   enforcement and strongly favor Americans having and being trained to use   firearms   for self protection.      Please think logically, most LEO's never have to fire their weapons in the line of duty. There is a reason for this, the criminal knows he WILL use the weapon and he will use it fairly well. The average criminal will prefer to surrender when he realizes he is facing someone trained and willing to use lethal force."
2," When I go to   church   there are more gun toting mama's and papa's there and I cant tell you one thing it does make me feel safer. These are responsible people by the way, not druggies or crazies, just God fearing, country loving, family protecting good ole folks. Maybe I will get a gun. No I think I ll just hang with those who have them instead."
2,When I preach I do step on toes.I have the druggies and some crazies and not very many responsible people setting in   church  .With   god   on my side I will keep   preaching  . 
1,"More home-owners are killed by gun-ownership than are saved While a right to self defense exists, it is important to note that more people are accidentally killed by their own guns than are saved by them. On this account, is the possession of guns, assault weapon or other, really ""self-defense""? Furthermore, assuming that gun ownership involves risks, the ownership of more deadly assault weapons may increase the risk of accidental death or mutilation.
"
2,"Well, I can see both sides trying to justify their position. Here's mine: I cordially invite ANY burgler to come and invade my home. Do I have a gun or not? Enter at your own risk!! Since I'm doing the invitation, you probably think I have a gun/  guns  . Are you willing to RISK YOUR LIFE on that? Are you prepared to meet your maker? You will not get a ""stop or I'll shoot"" warning. CLICK, BANG. That is all you'll receive. Still wanting to try to enter my home? Enough said. Guns make you safer because CRIMINALS LOVE UNARMED VICTIMS. RESPONSIBLE gun owners dont kill people. They kill criminals, muggers, car jackers, rapists, child molesters and those tryng invading their homes. James Allyn Washingon."
2,"Whether one agrees with the right to own guns or not, it is highly hypocritical of the States United to Prevent Gun Violence to dismiss the NRA's argument as invalid, due to problems in causal relationships, and then go on to commit its own similar arguments. The Hepburn and Hemenway document that was referred to is not without faults, and it actually works in neither the SUPG or the NRA's favor to cite it. The bipartisan fact checking website, Factcheck.org, provides a valuable article regarding this question and the topic at hand at   http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/are_violent_crimes_more_or_less_common.html  .Of important note is the following:""It found that studies of the United States or U.S. cities, states and regions 'generally find a statistically significant gun prevalence-homicide association.' ...So where there are guns, there is likely a higher rate of murders committed with guns in particular. However, the report noted, 'None of the studies can prove causation. They merely examine the statistical association between gun availability and homicide.' In fact, major studies on this issue have not shown cause-and-effect – that the presence of guns causes more murders to occur (or crime in general) – which is certainly a more difficult hypothesis to test.""Though I personally am a strong supporter of gun ownership and do believe that widespread gun ownership is safer than none, the argument for it (or against it), when it comes to causation of crime and murder, is not as simple as the NRA or the the States United to Prevent Gun Violence suggests. It is a very difficult thing to measure and quite often goes far beyond inanimate objects themselves."
2,"How about the murder per capita??  It is about the same as The rest of the country, no??  Maybe a little less-they have to walk a mile to find a neighbor to shoot."
1,"I think it's funny to suggest that there may be confirmation bias on the part of NRA supporters who call the conclusion of the Hepburn and Hemenway study into question.  One might use the quote: 'None of the studies can prove causation. They merely examine the statistical association between gun availability and homicide.'  One might use this quote as IF the Hepburn and Hemenway study DID find causation, they would AGREE with that causation, which according to their own POV, they WOULD NOT.  May I suggest that the ""causation"" mentioned is to keep the researchers from having to face endless witch-hunts?  You know, when you disagree, sometimes people tend to get violently 'passionate' with you.Of course when one side uses a document like the Constitution as the basis of their moral arguments, a document written by white slave-owners who imposed martial law to restrict the freedoms of millions... then one will always be correct in their assumptions of safety and freedom behind the barrel and the bullet."

2,"Reasons   gun control   doesn't work:1. Criminals by definition break   the law  . 2. Criminals get   guns   from family or friends, not   gun shows   or gun stores.3. Preventing   law  -abiding citizens from attaining guns will only help criminals by keeping guns away from law-abiding citizens."
2,Gun control doesn't work. Keeping   guns   from   law   abiding citizens will only help the criminals 
2,"I completely agree that the right to carry a gun does indeed make you safer, whether it is in your own home or at a college campus.  I am highly aware the fear people have about the wrong kind of people being able to carry, but the truth is that there are plenty of people that have respect for firearms, and therfore will use them to protect themselves and possibly others if needed.  It makes complete sense that crime would be lower in right to carry states."
2,"I totally agree with the argument that guns make you safer.  They are perfectly safe in the hands of responsible, law-abiding citizens.  I disagree with handgun bans because the only thing they do is give criminals an advantage by taking away the right of citizens to protect themselves."
2,"Although the federal government may not be, i'm a big fan of igilante justice. If someone breaks into your house armed with a gun, your handy bread knife isn't going to be enough to defend yourself from a criminal. Yes, guns are also used in crime, but 9 times out of 10, guns used in criminal acts have been obtained illegally. Criminals will get their guns, one way or another. Why stop innocent civilians from having a right to protect themselves in the case of an emergency?"

2,"I have to agree that Michigan has set an example.At the very least, criminal misuse of firearms hasn't increased since the CCW went from ""may-issue"" to ""shall-issue"" in 2001. As the news article cited indicates, reported criminal misuse of firearms has decreased marginally.It might be within the region of statistical noise. Or it might not.Apparently, the a statewide increase in concealed-carry-permit-holders hasn't done anything to increase criminal misuse of firearms.However, it is not the guns that make people safe. It is proper use of guns that make people safe."
2,"The Police can not be everywhere at once.  They are often outnumbered by 500 to 1 or more.  They do the best they can but they are not your personal body guard.  When seconds count, the Police are Minutes Away.  For this reason it is your personal responsibility to have & train with the tools necessary to secure yourself & your household."

2," Darn Skippy!  There is no such thing as a ""Gun Free Zone"" where armed criminals are concerned.  To them, ""Gun Free"" Translates as ""Ample Pickings"".Law-Abiding citizens need to have the option of LTC to protect themselves against the ever-growing population of armed-and-violent criminals that are running our streets."
2,"laws were not created to protect people, they were created to punish people."
2,"This is true, but not just for women.  In the case of a felonious attack by an armed assailant, a man is just as vulnerable as a woman.  I would also have to say that the victim deserves more than an ""equalizer,"" and in fact should have an advantage.  Most of these attacks happen outside the home; in dark parking lots, and other lonely, empty places.  How about let's change the rules?  How about handgun ownership automatically comes with a CCW (concealed carry permit)?  But it also comes with the responsibilities - that is, a handgun owner must receive extensive training - and I'm not talking about a couple of sessions at the local range - training in small arms for self-defense and situational awareness.  Ultimately, human life is at stake, and surely none of us wants a passerby hurt.  Imagine then how many criminals would consider a robbery in your local Mom & Pop, with the possibility of several armed and trained citizens inside."
1,"Ummm, I don't suppose it cuts any ice with you that the most civilized societies in the world ARE managing to live without guns? Your logic is flawed and pre-historic. You have more murders in one day in this country than most of Europe in its entirety in a month! The UK police force still manages to work without guns - and guess what - sky hasn't fallen in - and we're very safe than you very much. Only in America... yep, only in America.

2," Assault weapons are superior for self defense Revolver pistols typically hold 6 rounds. It is significant possibility that a person defending themselves from robbers or assailants would need more than 6 rounds, particularly if there are two or three of them. Yet, re-loading a revolver is time consuming and not a good situation to be in the face of attackers.

1,"Yes, thanks, well aware... you have to go back some time though to find these isolated incidents eh? A price we're willing to pay to live without guns. If I want to find out the latest school shooting in the U.S. though I'd have to go back all of, um, wait about 5 minutes?"
1,"Fair point I guess. Sad though that you have to live like cowboys to feel safe. This 'seige' mentality will ultimately get you nowhere I feel. The French managed to have a revolution without a second amendment and this line of thinking will never move your society forward. So sure, keep your guns and your death penalty, and out of control society like the US obviously needs both. When you're ready to join the rest of the first world let me know! (Although I feel the U.S. is sewing the seeds of it's own destruction and will probably implode from within in the next 100-150 years?) Luckily there are states in the north east that are more akin to European of thinking. You know, the trouble with the gun lobby and the death penalty addicts is that most of them are in the south - which also wanted to fight for keeping slavery. Weird, huh? My guess is that this debate can still be drawn along the north - south divide."

1,"""Indisputable studies have concluded that there are 2.5 million defensive uses of firearms every year.""The studies are definitely disputable. In fact, that statistic has been called into question consistently - and is easily disputed when compared to reported crime rates and common sense. Please cite the studies and we'll get into the details. Suffice it to say, there are not 2.5m thwarted crimes each year thanks to quick drawing gun owners.For every documented case of a permit holder thwarting a crime, I can show you several documented cases of a gun owner killing an innocent person. Hard to balance that cost with the benefit of occasional prevention.The rest of your argument doesn't seem to hold up when you look at the stats.     http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/Search/Crime/State/RunCrimeStatebyState.cfm    Florida was well above the national average in 1987 across all categories of crime. By 1993, most crime rates had gone up, continuing to stay above the national average. One category - homicide - fell from 11.4 per 100k residents to 8.9, falling just below the national average of 9.5 that year. Every other crime category saw an increase. So where were the concealed weapons effects there? How do you presume to prove that concealed weapon permit holders caused the decrease in homicide rates?Asking gun owners how often their guns stopped a crime is a highly charged question prone to error. The measured results show that the period of time you chose to look at saw an increase in the crime rate. And most people who study crime (peer-reviewed scientists and government agencies) will tell you that citizens' rate of gun ownership, concealed carry permit count and other measures of gun use by non-criminals has no material effect on crime rates.Perception is a powerful tool. Citing disputed results as indisputable and cherry picking statistics is not a valid way to form public opinion or guide legislation. It would be great if your version of reality were the truth, but it's not."

Given that her calves are about the size of my biceps, she can offer about zero effective resistance to anyone offering  her violence.  I hope she never needs to use the pistol she carries, but I'm glad she has it."
2,"""every day innocent children accidentally kill themselves or are killed by another child"" - that is an outright lie at worst, and a complete stretch of the truth at best.  If you include children killed by gang members AND include gang members killed by gang members, then yes every day would certainly be true.  To make such a statement you have to consider everyone under the age of 20 a child & completely innocent.  If you want to end gang violence you need to lock up the gang members, not disarm law abiding citizens."
2,"I have never understood this argument for taking away guns.  Sure there is some degree of risk involved in owning a firearm, but public safety and health can NEVER be allowed to trump our rights as citizens of these United States.  Otherwise we might as well rename the country ""The United Socialist States of America.""  Oh, and be prepared to kiss you right to speech against the government and your right to protection from illegal search and seizure to be ""temporarily suspended"" until they catch all outstanding criminals and hate crime perpetrators.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that even the government recognizes AT LEAST 1.5 million defensive handgun uses per year... that means hundreds of thousands of lives saved, if not millions every year.  Also, check your statistics, because every year more children under the age of 7 drown in toilets and bathtubs than die from firearms.  Why have I not seen an argument entitled ""Toilets and Tubs, Are Your Children Safe in Your Own Home?"""
2,"The latest data I can find on this matter is from the CDC using WISQARS tool.  For unintentional (accident) death-by-firearm for year 2005, ages 0 - 18 (not just 'children' but minors) the data show 154 fatalities out of 77,546,344 minors.  Sorry, but that's not very alarming.For suicides during the same year and for the same age range it was 600 even.  Again, that's not very alarming considering the number of minors.How about unintentional drowning?  1,057.  Same year, same age group.  Unintentional poisoning?  456.  Residential fire? 479.  Motor vehicle? 5,870.  My point in all of this is that 'children' die in a variety of ways more frequently than they do at the end of a gun, and stopping some guy at a cash register with another ill concieved law will not make these already low numbers go down."
2," I hold a degree in Actuarial Science and Quantitative Risk Analysis and I can tell you without any doubt that stats can be made to say whatever the presenter wants them to say. I grew up in a house with many firearms, some automatic, and never had an incident where either I, or one of my sisters, ever misused one. We were taught at an early age to respect our folks and obey them and that meant not to touch the firearms without their permission. I am currently a Loss Control/Risk Manager and can tell you that there are many dangers in your home that pose a greater risk to your children than firearms. I remember watching a mother on a talk show talk about how her teenaged stepson broke into the parents locked bedroom and retrieved their pistol and accidentally shot her son and paralyzed him. She said that both of the children were victims and the fact that the pistol was in the house was a tragedy waiting to happen. Is there no personal responsibility anymore? One thing I do not understand about the gun argument is that many of the anti-gun people who would rather see 100 innocent people deprived of the right to a firearm if it could prevent 1 criminal from misusing it are the same people who would rather see 100 criminals go free than see one innocent person go to jail. Does this make sense to anyone?"
2,"Banning semi-automatic weapons would harm small businesses. A ban on semi-automatic weapons would damage the revenue of small business. 
"
2,"I grew up in a house hold around firearms.  I was taught from an early age to respect them and to know what kind of damage they are capable of if misused.  Even with the access I had to them as a child, I never dreamed of using one to solve any altercations I may have encountered.  My heart goes out to those who have lost children because they, as parents were incapable of doing their job and teaching their children to respect them.  A gun is simply a tool, nothing more.  A child could take a sword to school and do as much damage as a gun can.  A kid could take his fork from lunch and stab the person next to him and kill him.  How many children have been killed by rocks?  I am sorry if my chosen past time makes you uncomfortable, I truly am.  I have made offers to many who oppose firearms to come out to my range and allow me to teach them about firearms and operate a few of them in a controlled environment where safety is of the utmost importance.  "
2,"If some people are irresponsible and routinely or momentarily fail to prevent small children from having access to their guns, then they should be punished under the appropriate laws (reckless endangerment, involuntary manslaughter, or whatever that may be).  If someone fails to properly keep knives out of reach of a child and that child stabs itself, you don't propose to ban non-governmental ownership of knives.  If some moron buckles their 2 year old into the front seat without a child seat of their car and that child is injured or killed, you don't propose to ban non-governmental ownership of automobiles arguing that public transportation will fulfill our transportation needs.  I know some people are horribly irresponsible.  I've read the horror stories too.  That's why my handgun is in my nightstand inside of a biometric (fingerprint) safe so that my 3 year old son can't get to it, but if the drug dealer that has followed me home twice decides to break in I can keep him from harming my son rather than just calling the police to come put me and my family in body bags.  Some people are stupid and irresponsible.  However, many are very responsible.  When the irresponsible cause others harm they should be punished, but the responsible should not punished due to others' irresponibility or incometence."
2,"#1 cause of death for   children   are motor vehicles. Should we ban cars?#2 is drowning. Should we ban swimming pools? Going to the beach?#3 is fires/burning. Should we ban fire? Smoking?

Should we make our   kids   wear nerf suits from head to toe?#11 is poisoning. Should we be required to watch everything our kids ingest, every minute, of every day, everywhere they may go?How about leaving   guns   alone, which is #12 on the list, until you're successful with all those others?"
2,"Yes, owning a gun kills   children  .  So does owning a car. But if everyone drove their   cars   responsibly, according to all applicable laws, this wouldn't be true.So does buying a plane ticket. But if planes were perfectly maintained and there were no extenuating circumstances like weather, this wouldn't be true.So does walking across the street. But if parents always looked both ways, and nobody ever ran red lights and always yielded to pedestrians this wouldn't be true.While some of the above examples are a bit ridiculous, so are all the arguments presented by the anti-gun agenda. The fact is, some people are irresponsible. Whether you're talking about   guns  , driving, taking   medication  , paying their bills; whatever. You CANNOT change the behavior of irresponsible people.However, if you look at the number of   legal   gun owners in the U.S. vs. the number of violent crimes and accidents attributed to them, you will see they are among the safest group, statistically. While the story above is tragic, it was the result of irresponsible parents. Parents who would leave a loaded gun so obviously accessible to a 3 year old child, probably leave poisonous   chemicals   like bleach within easy reach as well. But where is the anti-bleach agenda in this country? Another thing the author forgets to mention is the myriad other ways children die in this country at much higher rates than gun accidents, most of which are also preventable."
2,"maybe it's time to change your position.You claim: “owning a gun in many instances places our   children   in grave danger.” I’m sorry, but on what ACTUAL RESEARCH is your claims based?

2,"By telling stories instead of concrete numbers, you ignore the larger picture. For every incident of a tragic fatality from a firearm, there are an equal, or greater number of incidences where lives are saved by firearms.To try to use an occasional story to legislate the majority is a disservice against all Americans. Review this story for basis:    http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/08/AR2008060800576.html    A Japanese man drove a large truck hitting pedestrians and then stabbing them.

1,"Since when is preventing 1 out of every 100 children's death not worth legislation? Simply because gun owners have become less negligent over time doesn't mean gun ownership now justifies kids dying. The facts are that guns don't prevent crimes in the classic NRA image (a homeowner killing an intruder or a ""responsible"" vigilante shooting dead a perceived threatening person) at nearly the rate that children, spouses, neighbors, policemen and innocent bystanders are killed by guns. The benefit has never outweighed the costs. Only concentrated lobbying dollars has kept this fact from guiding legislation.Think of the people you know who you consider to be a little ""off"". Quick to fight. Quick to throw a punch. Now imagine them armed. Able to pull out a weapon and begin killing people instantly. Do you feel safer knowing they can get a gun anytime they wish?Ask any policeman - people who spend more time with guns, and the people that use them, than the vast majority of the population - if they would prefer everyone they encounter to be armed. I've never met a policeman who encouraged the population to be more armed so their jobs would be easier. I'm sure you'll find sheriffs pandering for votes in Nevada or Florida who would disagree, but actual frontline patrolmen would tell you it's a terrible idea. Fistfights become gun fights. Knife fights become gun fights. Etc.The second amendment was conceived in the 18th century by a war-weary country who had just ""negotiated"" their freedom using muskets and bayonets. Britain had used gun control to ensure there were no insurrections or Protestant uprisings against the crown and the Founding Fathers didn't want to see that policy enacted in the US. The NRA enjoys trotting out this logic - that somehow banning guns ensures an Orwellian state's rule over us - but today's technology and political reality shows the fallacy of this logic. One could argue that with Habeas Corpus suspended, electronic eavesdropping legalized and ""secret executive powers"" an unchecked privilege, the citizens of this country have never had less freedom or been less in control. Not one bullet has been fired to achieve this and no one doubts that any armed revolution would be put down quickly by the U.S. military. Gun control is a crime and safety issue - not one of political independence or ""protection"" from the same government the NRA insists enforce existing gun laws by prying into suspected criminals' homes to keep guns out of their possession.The NRA demonstrably puts the interests of their dues paying members (gun manufacturers and gun owners) ahead of the majority of the U.S. population who do not want guns on the streets. The concentrated benefits of their lobbying dollars outweighs the diluted interest level and attention of the average voter. No matter how many malls, schools, churches and public gatherings get attacked by gun wielding maniacs, the NRA will be there to insist that we are all better off with more guns in citizens' hands."
2,"Do a search to find some child gun death stories, then search on names in the story to find followup details.  In almost all of these stories you'll find obvious risk factors in the household--drugs, felons, gangs, previous abuse, an unemployed boyfriend babysitting children from another man, often several factors at once.  You will usually find evidence that the presence of the gun was already against the law.  You will also find that most of these stories are of fairly young children.  To find the teens you will need to search for something like ""gang shooting""You aren't likely to find ordinary law-abiding middle class households with ""child gun deaths"".  After you ask the policeman if he wants *everyone* armed, ask his opinion on licensed concealed carry, an entirely different question.  You will find that street cops have a good opinion of license holders--They understand we are allies, not enemies.  Look up the percentage of criminal convictions among license holders--You'll find that we are many times more law-abiding than the general population, and slightly more law abiding than police.  Fistfights don't turn into gunfights but rather are avoided entirely--The kind of people who get into fistfights rarely get licenses. Take a look at the malls, schools and churches where gun wielding maniacs show up--you will find that ""no guns allowed"" areas account for a vastly disproportionate number of these cases.  Even the insane can understand they can kill more people if they have the only guns until the police show up.  Luckily these shooters are rare--in a year they don't have as many victims as a single day of traffic fatalities. "
1,"My objection is the argument that only ""irresponsible"" people cause accidental gun deaths so it's not worth changing the laws for everyone else. This presumes that we need guns in the hands of responsible people and the deaths of kids due to irresponsible people is just an unfortunate, but necessary, cost of keeping gun ownership legal.The statistical facts are that guns in a home increase the chance that someone in that home will be killed by that gun due to a homicide, suicide or accident at a level well above the chance that the gun will be used for self-defense. Here is the list of stats and their sources on one website:    http://www.ichv.org/Statistics.htm    I tend to believe the CDC and New England Journal of Medicine, though I'm sure the NRA's researchers will claim they have some anti-gun agenda funded by their insatiable desire to obtain more tax dollars or perhaps those pediatricians' blood thirsty quest to keep their patients alive so they can keep billing them for office visits...I'm not sure what alliance a concealed carry permit holder is making with the police. Are you going to be drawing your weapon and shooting at any criminal you see? I haven't seen any police chief or FBI director endorse that kind of help. I don't doubt that most gun owners are law abiding. The problem is that several thousand each year are not. And when they want to break the law, they have an almost unlimited access to incredibly powerful weapons. We would all be far safer if those people were presented with the choice of using a knife or their fists versus having to try to break into a military base to obtain a weapon more powerful and dangerous than a hunting rifle. Several hundred more gun owners make the mistake each year of leaving their weapons where a child can get access to them and then shoot themselves or someone else.Your point that large scale public shootings happen BECAUSE of ""no gun zones"" - is one of the more incendiary arguments I've heard in awhile. The point of not allowing guns in there is to prevent the kind of crime that happened. If those people had to go through a rigorous licensing process, have to pay a hefty fee to own even one rifle and in general not have the option of buying up several hand guns, semi automatic assault rifles and armor piercing bullets with a valid drivers license and a fairly clean criminal background, they wouldn't have the ability to kill at the scale and efficiency they've been able to achieve. The thought that the best defense against those kind of people is to arm everyone who wants to carry a gun around town is a leap of faith most people are not willing to make. We'd rather have everyone but the police disarmed and make it much more difficult for mentally disturbed/violent/criminal/irresponsible people to obtain weapons. And the incidents are not ""rare"". Killing ten or more people intentionally in the span of 30 minutes is ""rare"" when it happens once a year. Having a student come into school and shoot classmates and teachers is ""rare"" when it happens once every five years. When it happens 5-10 times per year, it's ""frequent"".And as a final note - the rate of deaths due to lots of other causes far exceeds handguns. Heart disease, lung cancer, traffic fatalities, pedestrian deaths etc. The difference is that these are all by products of either diseases or useful tools where most people agree their benefits outweigh the costs. Most people don't agree that the benefit of gun ownership outweighs the cost to society. But because most people don't care enough to lobby and vote based on this issue as much as the NRA lobbies and funds campaigns against congressmen that vote against them, legislators don't take their side."
2," Semi-automatic assault weapons are often misrepresented Semi-automatic assault weapons are weapons in which one pull of the trigger shoots one bullet. These weapons are commonly used at shooting ranges and in hunting. Yet, they are often misrepresented as ""machine guns"" with heavy destructive force. 
"
2,"The statistical facts you talk about have severe flaws when trying to use them to justify more laws.  First is counting suicide as ""gun violence"", assuming that all those who choose a gun would not find another method if guns are not available.  (Japan...) Even if that were true, an increased risk of suicide may be a reason to try to convince people to voluntarily give up guns.  It is not sufficient justification to eliminate freedom and choice.  Second is the definition of ""used in self defense"".  Over 90% of the time when a law-abiding person defends with a gun, no shots are necessary.  These studies insist that the defender must shoot or kill someone before it counts as ""used in self defense"".  My definition of defense is quite different--If someone runs away I will let them, and consider that the best possible outcome to a bad situation.  Finally, households with convicted criminals have many times higher rates of gun violence-Not even in the same league as the law abiding.  Eliminate these people from your sample and the ""violence"" rates plummet. It isn't the guns causing the danger, it is the criminal behavior, including illegally possessing guns.  Adding laws that restrict the behavior of the law-abiding in order to stop criminals who are already ignoring existing laws isn't logical.  Ally in the sense of having goals in common, and rarely conflicting.  Not as in ""members of the same team, working together to capture criminals"".  As far as safer?   Without legal firearms criminals have a much clearer idea of who makes a good victim-Pick a small weak looking person walking alone, and a knife, or even a couple of similarly inclined associates are plenty.  Lawful guns create a shield effect, even to those not using them.  Spree shootings aren't CAUSED by ""no gun"" zones, they are caused by spree shooters.  Spree shootings have fewer victims when there is someone on the scene who can shoot back-In more than one case, to the point of not being large-scale despite evidence that was the intent.  In most cases, that means a license holder.  Spree shooters realize this, and if they have a choice of venue, they are likely to pick the one where guns are forbidden. ""Arm everyone"" is not what is proposed.  When states adopt objective licensing criteria, licenses seem to stabilize at roughly 2% of the population, roughly 10 years later.  All available data says that this 2% is many times more law abiding and less violent than the general population.  The idea that ""most people"" would rather have ""everyone disarmed"" flies in the face of gun ownership rates--Somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 of American households own guns, and many who don't own guns still think that it should be allowed. What ""most people"" would like to see is enforcement of existing laws.  When someone fails a gun purchase background check, there is an arrest about 1% of the time--There should be a police investigation 100% of the time, and a whole lot more arrests.  "
1,"    http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf    This summary of surveys backs up part of your argument and part of mine:    http://www.pollingreport.com/guns.htm    I can no longer say most people want everyone but the police disarmed. That's not true according to these polls. But they do want gun laws to be stricter.I'd argue that making guns easily available but trying to legislate their purchase and ownership through poorly funded systems of gun laws is a recipe for disaster. I think the theory is good - and if police and the FBI had enough money to chase every failed background check, and every state spent enough money to keep the background check system accurate, it could work out. But like most good ideas there's not enough money to make it work in the real world. So I'd argue you have to eliminate the supply to effect the restrictions the law is attempting to achieve.I won't argue that permit-carrying licensed gun owners aren't more law-abiding than the rest of the population. My point is that those that want to cause harm can get access to weapons too easily. I don't think the concealed-carry permit holders are a good defense against them. So I'm in favor of making most guns illegal to sell or own, except for a restricted set of hunting rifles which requires a high fee to own and is strictly monitored by a well funded government system. I think that would make everyone safer."
2,"A whole lot of people don't know what the current laws are. There is an impression that criminals go to gun shows to buy $100 full-auto AK47's from dealers without a background check.  If lying on a 4473 usually put you in jail (like it should...) then pretty soon the word would get out, and people would quit trying.  If we aren't even going to make a token attempt to enforce a law, we shouldn't keep that law.Eliminating the supply to the law-abiding is fairly easy--Just pass a law.  Eliminating the criminal supply is much more difficult.  Guns last decades or centuries--I personally know someone who until this year carried a gun last manufactured in the mid 1920's.   We can't keep consumable drugs out of our country--Can we keep durable guns out?  If not, then the lack of supply is more than made up for by the lack of resistance.  "
2,"Sevesteen pointed out the 1% errors- but you are not correct in saying more innocents die as a result of guns than not. It's just not the case. You can check with FBI statistics if you like.as for the rest of your argument-Ignore guns for a moment, and view only the Bill of Rights as you referenced.To allow significant infringement of the 2nd amendment is to set precedent for the entire BOR to come into question. You mention the suspension of HC, how about the suspension of all free speech? Religion? Right to a fair trail, trail by jury? What about the right to not self incriminate?You speak of modern America- but you cannot speak of future America. Who knows what the political climate will be in 50 years? 100? certainly no one in the past predicted our current political and technological climate.You risk negotiating rights for the youth and the unborn of America by using today's standards as your guide. You have no knowledge, and no right to legislate what Future America will want and need for itself. You open the door for more than guns to be taken away. Do not do so without significant consideration."
1,"See my response above on stats.Passing a law to ban handgun ownership wouldn't put the entire Bill of Rights in jeopardy. You can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater. Public schools can't force children to say a Christian prayer. You can't form a public demonstration in most cities without a permit. These and many other reasonable restrictions on the rights granted to us by the constitution have been enforceable laws for decades and no one would argue they've put the entire Bill of Rights at risk. Present and Future America is happy to have these kinds of protections.By the way - my point in the first posting is that many of the rights in the Bill of Rights have already been curtailed surreptitiously (including one of your hypotheticals - the right to defend your charges in court - Habeus Corpus). I'm not in favor of this - I am in favor of a law being debated and passed to accomplish this restriction. If the NRA would spend some lobbying dollars to reign in an executive branch gone haywire, they might start getting some of my money. You could argue no one's done more to trample on the Bill of Rights than this current administration. Isn't the NRA supposed to protect the Constitution?Future America will likely think it odd that their ancestors thought shoppers in a mall with a gun holster under their coats were the most reasonable protection we could envision against mentally disturbed people who were determined to kill as many people as they could. Some weapons are just too dangerous for the average person on the street to possess.As long as we're talking about freedom and the bill of rights, I would like to point out that I'm in favor of personal liberties. If handguns weren't killing other people at alarming rates, and only killing their owners, I wouldn't have a problem with them. The issue is that handguns and assault rifles kill other people, by design. The studies have shown that handguns are used in homicides and cause accidental deaths at a far higher rate than they are used in self-defense. They provide the ability to kill quickly and rapidly. Most people just don't want to see that ability granted to the public at large."
2,"First off- thank you for your citation. Now that we are both looking at the same data I think we can be on the same page more. I hope you don't mind- but I went straight to the CDC website for the original data- I could not find 2005? anyway- all the stuff I'll be referencing will be 2004. I guess I couldn't find the 05 data on their site.first look at this- its a study by the CDC re: the effectiveness of Gun Laws (Including concealed carry)    http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5214a2.htm    all their research boils down to 'inconsistent results' continuing on with the CDC- less than 1% of all homicides and suicides of school age persons (age 10-24) occur in or on school grounds.also according to the CDC between 1992 and 2006, school homicide rate was on the decline, and school related homicides were perpetrated with a firearm 65 or so % of the time.    http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/YV_DataSheet.pdf    Obviously that data is missing VT, NIU, and some other major tragedies, but  the channel to purchase firearms legally is not where the 'violence problem' is coming from.I'll have to dig out the research- I think you can find it in 'gunfacts' (google gunfacts and you'll find a free webbook on it)but you mention assault rifles- prior to the brady bill they were used in less than 1.5% of crimes involving guns. 1.5% They have legitimate sporting and self defense purposes. I'm going to give you a quick sidebar here to help my point- as I don't mean to call you ignorant (I don't think you are) but I think firearms may be a bit foreign to you in their capabilities.Lets look at an AR-15 , the civilian version of the m16 that our soldiers carry. It is legal in many parts of the country, but not all- and fires 1 round per 1 trigger pull (that is semi-automatic)the most standard caliber is 223 remington, which has a military counterpart called 5.56x45- they aren't identical- but for the sake of this conversation we will assume they are- as a 5.56 gun can fire 223 without any issues.it fires a 55gr projectile around 3000 FPS. That sounds fast and powerful- but, did you know that the 55gr projectile going that fast will have less power to penetrate walls and homes than a many pistol rounds? its a function of physics- and again i'll try to find the data- I'm on my way to class right now and don't have time to run through all the numbers but maybe I can paint a picture for you anyway-a smaller  lighter projectile loses energy faster than a slower, heavier one. Its inertia. Like a semi going 35 miles an hour hitting a honda civic going 85. the semi still wins.so what is the point of all that? legislation, though often enacted with seemingly good intentions- is often done by people who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. as me and you both seem very pro-civil liberties, I'd rather they not mess anything else up, and instead focus more on proven methods of crime prevention- like more police.of the handguns you reference- the vast majority are obtained ILLEGALLY- I see what your aiming for here- you want to choke off the supply and the problem will smother itself.Think of prohibition- we choked off the supply of alcohol, and what happened? it became so profitable to deal in it illegally that we gave rise to a massive crime syndicate in the US. The criminals still had booze, they still had guns, and now they had immense amounts of cash to finance whatever they needed.if you outlaw handguns and assault rifles the same thing will happen again. Good people will not have them, and criminals still will- because they exist outside the law. it'll become so profitable that a huge black market (a huger I should say- guns for crime are often dealt illegally anyway) where a situation is created where only criminals can get guns.Penn and Teller had a show called bullshit- or something to that effect, and they did a show on the effects of gun control. one of the things they did, was to go interview violent criminals in prison, and ask if any of the anti-gun laws in place choked supply of guns for them- the answer? no. alls it did was ensure that the people they intended to hurt (assuming not another criminal) was most likely unarmed.In my experience, many people who are anti-gun are so because they are not familiar with firearms and their actual capabilities. If we demystify what they are capable of, I think you, and many other people who feel the same way, will feel far more comfortable around them."
1,"Let me go point by point:- The ""inconclusive"" description in the first cited CDC study is in regards to their ability to from a conclusion either way (proving gun control works or proving it doesn't work). You need to look at the full sentence which I've edited for brevity by removing studies' names:""On the basis of national law assessments (...), international comparisons (..), and index studies (..), available evidence was insufficient to determine whether the degree of firearms regulation was associated with decreased (or increased) violence. The findings were inconsistent and most studies were methodologically inadequate to allow conclusions about causal effects."" If gun ownership was such a clear deterrent to crime and benefit to society, how could any of these non-partisan studies be inconsistent or nonconclusive? It's not from a lack of looking or research. If there's any reasonable doubt, you should err on the side of safety and take guns off the streets. The results in terms of gun deaths, homicide rates and other measures of gun-related violence in other developed countries with gun restrictions seems to prove conclusively that gun control keeps citizens safer and does not enable criminals to go on an armed rampage unchecked by helpless civilians (Penn and Teller's academic research not withstanding. As an aside I think they are hilarious paid good money to see them in Vegas and would gladly do so again).- 65% use of guns in school homicides still sounds amazingly high to me. Why not target that going to zero?- I appreciate the primer on ballistics. I'm not sure you'll ever convince me that civilian guns have been watered down so as to be ""acceptably"" dangerous when shot. Assault rifles, if only used to shoot animals and targets, and never modified to become fully automatic, would be of no threat to anyone. But in reality they are not. Some get modified and some get used to kill multiple people. What's the sporting benefit that outweighs this risk? Why not use a hunting rifle with a 5 or even 7 bullet clip? And why on earth is a .50 calibre sniper's rifle even an option for a civilian to purchase?- See many European countries as evidence for the lack of actual black market results when gun ownership is restricted. Prohibition was a curtailment of a personal choice that did not involve the killing of innocent bystanders and enablement of deranged people to go on killing sprees. The majority of people voted to repeal it. The majority of people today would vote to get guns off the street. It's the concentrated lobbying power of the minority of people that own guns that keep the laws as is.- My brother keeps a loaded 9mm Glock in his house with no trigger lock and in an unlocked lock box (lost the key). His rationale is that if he needs to use it, he needs to get to it quickly. The risk of his 3 year old getting access to it doesn't seem to concern him as much. He is one of many, many ""real gun owners"" who prove that all of the NRA preaching about personal responsibility, education and screening really don't work. As this study shows:    http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf    most gun owners don't observe the safety rules they were trained on, and a significant number were never even trained.So unfortunately a few bad apples (gun owners who kill people) do spoil the bunch. It's not worth the risk of death to everyone (children, students, bystanders, victims) to enable gun enthusiasts to keep most of their guns and the inconclusive crime deterrent effects they may provide. I think we could all live with a system that makes gun ownership a significant burden to achieve, costly to maintain and restricted to a very narrow collection of hunting rifles. It would still enable the right to bear arms, but not make it so easy to enable so many deaths and injuries."
2,"I'm going to address points out of order more so just for sake of my personal mental clarity.as for modifying 'assault rifles' - make no mistake that modifying a civilian legal firearm like an AK-47 variant (like a WASR-10) or an AR-15 to full auto is a difficult task that requires a skilled machinist and parts and modifications not readily available. this is not something bobby the  backyard gunsmith can do with any kind of provision. At best- they will tamper with the sear engagement (think of it like the govenour on a car) when the sear is tripped- the gun will fire one round- if they mess with it, the gun may just fire from the time its loaded till the time its empty (like having your car 's accelerator floored from the moment you turn on your ignition. At worst (or at best depending on how you look at it) they fudge engagement of the internal workings to the point that the weapon becomes inoperable. I address your Assault weapons question first- because its a pet peeve of mine. Assault weapons is a misnomer. It was a term that has been applied to firearms outside of the definition of the phrase- meaning, its like calling all cars Formula 1 racing cars- one is a subset of the other, and a very exclusive, narrowly defined subset. Next- I guess we just interpret the data differently. (from the CDC) you see one gun death, on record, as justification for banning firearms. There is no data showing how many instances where firearms prevent violence. I've read estimates that say 2 million per year. I'm going to say, for the sake of our argument, that 2m is a gross exaggeration, and I'll say its been exaggerated by 10 fold. so now we have 200,000 examples where firearms prevented violence. If you could do a long term study on that- guns saving lives- that I think is the missing link we need to settle our argument. Do guns cause deaths? yes. Absolutely. I believe (and I really do believe this) that they save more lives.while i'm looking up links- here's gunfacts.     http://www.gunfacts.info    /you might not agree with it, but at least now your aware of its existence. I especially recommend pages 5-10 or so, as they deal with 'assault weapons'. if only so we use the same language to continue our conversation.here is the info on that suggested 2 million saves a year- I admit fully that the data is dated. it was from a study in 1997. thats why I now underestimate it so heavily- (not that I think its gone down, but just because I think the argument is still valid)""Targeting Guns"" Dr Gary Kleck. Florida State University 1997 (I have no digital copy)basically- (and I apologize in advance for this) check pages 15-22 as well. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm lecturing, but I can summarize it- but then you'll just go check it anyway, so I figure why not waste your time.If you think any of these studies are for some reason less valid then the ones you mention, we can talk about sample size, statistical integrity, and all of that stuff. Your reference to Europe, I think, is circular. You focus on Gun violence.Cut out gun- and you still have violence. Thats the big problem, and many European countries have that in no short supply. Heck after the UK ban on guns went into effect the Lethality of Officer involved confrontation (meaning violence against officers) increased significantly as the police' ballistic vests could not withstand the surge in knife wounds. They created a monster where MORE people died.As for your brother's practices- I believe all gun owners, after passing the required background check and safety courses, having been established to be of sound mind and body- should be allowed to carry their firearms. My father has carried since 1979 and has never once brandished a firearm in anger or accidentally. Thats almost 30 responsible years of no incident."
2,"I personally, feel I have a responsibility to keep firearms in such a manner as not to intrigue children. My brother has several young ones, and we have 2 large safe's to house our guns. When they are old enough to understand, each of the children will have guns explained to them, their capabilities and safe handling. I think you need to demystify guns to prevent youth endangerment. these few ""accidental"" deaths of children (pools kill more kids by the way, I think thats on the CDC website) I believe occur because no one took the time to sit little johnny or susie down and say this is mommy or daddy's gun. this is how it works and this is why you shouldn't touch it. if you want to see it, ask mom or dad, and we'll make it safe for you to understand.the ballistics primer- those aren't watered down for civilians, thats really the capability of the platform. You take an AR-15 from me, from your local military base, or your local PD and thats what it'll do.as for your capacity restriction question- again more random facts, most states do have capacity restrictions for game hunting, and for a rifle it is usually 5 rounds. I'm not preaching, just making you aware of it.why should civilians have the right to higher capacity magazines? I apologize, but I'm not sure where to find the #s of shootings where x number of rounds is fired in a concise package. My guess is the FBI has it somewhere, but who knows how long that will take to tease out. Anyway- what I'm going for is there are many many violent assaults each year where multiple criminals attack, beat, rape, and kill. Even if your local PD has a fantastic response time of 2 minutes- 2 minutes is a long time to keep many individuals at bay while you retreat and try to get you and yours to safety.finally a note on 50 caliber rifles- They've never been used in a crime. The caliber has been around for nearly a 100 or so years give or take. It doesn't get used in crimes. rifles in that caliber start around 2000 dollars. ammunition is several dollars per round. Its not going to be picked up on the black market as a hot item to commit crimes with. It's just not. also you wanna ban 50 cal weapons? by doing so you ban many blackpowder/musket style rifles, which are extremely popular for traditional hunters and marksmen. if you ban 50+ cal weapons, you pretty much make every gun in the revolutionary war illegal. Also- 12 gauge shotguns, with a nominal bore diameter of nearly .7 inches, would also become illegal.basically your spelling death to much of the current level of north American hunting. Not sure if thats what you want, but thats what it would be. You'd be outlawing so much, to prevent something that has never been misused, from continuing to not be misused.I'm sorry for all the car analogies, but I feel like its an easy to understand parallel. Thats like banning cars because some cars go over 200 mph. Sure no one goes over 200 mph on your street, but in theory, with enough money, someone could- so lets just get rid of all automobiles and go to mopeds."
1,"I have no problems with muskets and black powder. If a thief robs me using a blunderbuss, more power to him and his historical affections. I think a system like they have in the UK which involves high fees, tight design restrictions and a well-funded, stringent licensing system would accomplish the goal of keeping most hunting weapons legal.My bottom-line argument is that handguns and military-style rifles (aka assault weapons - a label which I think you'll find most gun manufacturers love as it boosts their product image among the target buyers) are too easy to get and the minority of the population that can't be trusted to act rationally and in society's best interest shouldn't have as easy access to them as they do now. Enforcing a strict and expensive licensing system should reduce the incidents of theft as owners will be incented to take better care of their weapons, and the less responsible owners will be ""self selected"" out of ownership as they will likely choose to not bother with a time-consuming, expensive process that will fine or jail them if they violate it.Making these kinds of weapons illegal would certainly force people that want to get them to pursue illegal means. As they do in the UK and other countries. The results though are that a black market has not emerged at the scale predicted by the gun supporters. Gun violence and gun-related homicide happen at a fraction of the rate predicted. This is true across multiple countries.My final argument is this - no matter the level of passion expressed by the minority of the population that wants to keep this policy as is, the fact that the majority of the population wants to change it should prevail when it comes to legislation. The 2nd Amendment is no more sacred than any other Amendment which has been interpreted, reintrepeted and limited by modern lawmakers. I note that most gun right activists have stopped arguing we need to maintain a well regulated militia, as described in the preamble of this amendment. Anachronisms like that are a sign of why we can't let arguments like ""the founding fathers intended it to be this way"" hold sway over the current opinion and measured results of policy today.It's a passionate issue - one that gets voters out and voting, manufacturers vast profits and gets the NRA and other lobbying groups enormous sums of money. The political nature of this issue means that rational debate and argument are hard to conduct without extremists from both ends weighing in and making it highly emotional.My final thought - I think - is that personally I like guns. I enjoy the design and manufacturing quality that goes into a well made gun. The precision required to turn the relatively light pressure of pulling a trigger on a semi-automatic weapon into an extremely powerful firing pin, case ejection, round loading and re-cocking of the hammer action is impressive to me. And it does feel good to shoot them. But I don''t let that outweigh the risks posed to everyone when that kind of power is granted to people who just can't use it correctly. It's too dangerous and not worth the risk. That's a calculation that most people have made. I wish people were more responsible, but they aren't. "

July 2, 2003 - ""It should be remembered that an armed pilot resisting a hijacking faces a much simpler scenario than a typical defensive shooting by an FBI agent, a police officer, or a citizen with a concealed handgun permit. These latter three must be prepared for surprise attacks, and for the possibility of using firearms in any of the hundreds of places where a person might be during the course of a day. Law-enforcement officers must confront the additional difficulty of being forced to intervene in situations (such as domestic disturbance) in which it may not be immediately clear who is the aggressor and who is the victim. In contrast, the armed pilots would only use firearms in a place they know extremely well: their own cockpit...""

2,"nbkwx55 states in his first paragraph: ""The facts are that guns don't prevent crimes in the classic NRA image (a homeowner killing an intruder or a ""responsible"" vigilante shooting dead a perceived threatening person) at nearly the rate that children, spouses, neighbors, policemen and innocent bystanders are killed by guns. The benefit has never outweighed the costs.""Even though I did read further, I didn't have to, you have officially been brainwashed to accept what you hear from Gun Control, Inc. oops, I mean their new name... The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.  The fact is that over 1.5 million PEOPLE use guns defensively every year, that was found by the government and in their own words was quite possibly a rather low figure, it may be as much as 2.5 million a year, which some studies by respected people have shown.  That number FAR outweighs the number of deaths per year in America that are caused by guns (I am strictly talking about murders and accidental shootings).  A person has an undeniable human right to protect themselves or their families from a ""perceived threat"" as you call it.  Guess what?  If no one ever broke into anybody's house, no one would be shot because they broke in.  Stop feeling sorry for criminals... I know you do because you think they are victims, but people come from horrible circumstances every day and make something of themselves.  It's all about personal choice and responsibility for our decisions and actions."
1,"I stand by original statement - criminals aren't _killed_ by private gun owners (or shot by them) at nearly the rate that victims and innocent people are.The ""1.5m people use guns defensively every year"" statistic is a tough one. I can find studies that refute that number and I'm sure you can find studies that show it's higher. The true number will probably never be known. It's like asking a car owner ""what's the fastest you have driven in the last twelve months?"" - many honest people will answer that incorrectly and passionate people may exaggerate the truth.I know it's hard to listen to the other side on an issue you passionately believe in, but I'm pretty sure no reasonable person believes James Brady is a brainwasher. Getting shot by some nutjob with no business possessing a weapon is a pretty good motivator to spread the word on this issue, but I think his namesake organization stops well short of brainwashing. I'm pretty sure he'd tell you that defensive gun stats don't make up for the fact that he's paralyzed and the President almost died (again) at the hands of a gun owner.Would you argue that the Constitution features a gun ownership right because of the deterrent effects on crime? Or the deterrent against a tyrannical government? I'd argue the latter. I don't trust most people I know, let alone the population at large, to brandish a firearm and have the ability to kill 6-9 people in under a minute if they decide they are a threat to them. The fact that so many innocent people get killed by guns each year, and in dramatically sad ways like mass public shootings, makes it particularly hard to justify the need for their easy possession or a calculation that there's a greater need to keep guns on the streets for crime prevention. Especially when guns enable crime - making their deterrent effect diminished. I think a gun owner should calculate that there's a pretty high chance anyone motivated enough to rob/attack them is armed. If you believe escalating a property crime to a homicide is the right response, I don't think you're in the same camp as most people.I do think killings would go down if we took most guns off the street. That's both criminals and victims dying. ""General violence"" as described above may go up, but if fewer people die isn't that still a net positive? I'm not aware of gun-control countries having significantly higher rates of violent crimes than the U.S. - I'm willing to eat my words if that's true.So I'm not here to argue for the rights of criminals. I'm here to argue for everyone's right to not be killed by a gun."
2,"Frankly speaking, I don't have time in my life for people who have the propensity to allow ""the greater good"" to strip away freedoms.  I have read your arguments and there is no convincing you otherwise, so live your life and I hope that you never come against a criminal with a gun who wants to kill you.  Your position on this issue could be fatal."
1,"You shouldn't have the personal freedom to own a product whose only purpose is killing multiple people. If we banned most guns, I'd be much less worried about a criminal with a gun who wants to kill me.Is the US in a situation where 1.5m to 2.5m times every year, someone has to show a gun to stop a crime, and yet so many crimes still get committed (174 victims per 1,000 citizens age 12 and over in 2006, per the Dept of Justice's summary NCVS (    http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm    #summary)? If you add up both categories (committed and ""stopped"" crimes), we're living in a war zone. Statistically speaking, you have a 50+% chance of having to show your gun once every 5 years to stop a crime just to keep the defensive gun stats up, and you'll still be a victim of a crime once every 3 years. Does that seem to match up with your experience?Unless, of course, the defensive gun use statistics are exaggerated. And guns are really enabling crimes at a rate on par to that with which they are preventing crime. And it's all part of a broader problem of a mis-perception of the high risk of crime and the need to keep guns on the street to prevent them. Which situation seems more likely - the war zone or the false perception?The assumption that gun possession keeps you safer is just false. The gun you own is more likely to be used to kill you, your spouse or an innocent person than to kill an attacker. The perception that armed attackers lurk around every dark corner is also false. The perceived need for guns keeps them on the street. The actual experience is that they are not effective crime deterrents, their easy access means criminals have easy access to guns and the average person on the street is not safer as a result.Many dangerous weapons can only be possessed and used legally by the government. It's time we made handguns and most high capacity rifles part of that category."
2,"neither of us have realistic stats- I do think the brady campaign uses questionable (read unethical) methods of persuasion with false claims and exageratted statistics.High capacity rifles aren't used in crimes, and pistols aren't easy to come buy. your asking for impossible to enforce legislation. we have gun laws now, that if enforced, would prevent the crime your referring to.we don't need more laws- we need the government to enable our police to do their jobs, not help some fat politician get re-elected by banning some other thing with lies about its use in crime."
2,"I have a couple of questions on the statistics here, as it is not clear to me. First, does the DOJ include the 1.5M defensive uses in their calculations even if the   crime   is prevented, but still reported? For example, a gun owner pulls his gun in self defense, the perp runs, but the gun owner still reports it? Also, what about the   legal   use of a firearm to that injures or kills a perp, so the crime doesn't actually get committed? This would affect the overall statistics. I didn't read the whole PDF, so I'm not sure.Second, if there are 360M people in the U.S., how does 1.5M defensive uses per year equate to one use by every citizen every five years? (1.5M X 5 = 7.5M, unless my calculator is broke). You can't include the entire population in one statistic and only a portion in another and then try to compare them. You are saying that 62.64M people are victims of crime, but forgetting that not all of them use their weapon in defense.The actual percentage of victims that use their   firearms   in defense is around 2%, according the statistics you quoted (1.5M defensive uses / 62.64M crimes committed = 0.0239 or approximately 2%). That is, of course, assuming that all defensive uses are reported and included in the statistic of crimes committed. The assumption that gun possession keeps you safer is not false. 40% of criminals say they would not attack someone they believe to be armed. That equates to   guns   being a deterrent.And if there are 1500 accidental gun deaths per year on average but there are 1.5M (or approximately 1,000 times more) defensive gun uses per year, how exactly am I more likely kill myself or a loved one with my gun? I admit I was poor at math in school, so maybe you can help me there.And according to CDC statistics accidental deaths of ALL types rank 5th in the U.S. as a cause of death, with firearms being 8th among accidental deaths. That's pretty far down the chain. How about we focus on the first 4 causes of death, and then the first 7 causes of accidental death? That would reduce the mortality rate in this country significantly, while focusing on   gun control   would barely be a drop in the bucket.At the risk of repeating myself, don't confuse LEGAL gun ownership and use with ILLEGAL gun ownership and use. Those that possess a carry permit in the U.S. commit crimes at a much lower rate than the general population, even lower than   police  . For example, Florida has 1.5M carry permit holders, and have revoked 166 of them since 1996. That's about 0.01%. If only the rest of the general population was that   law  -abiding. The statistics for the rest of the country are similar, but this is one I knew off the top of my head."
2,"Your statement that ""[...]  guns   enable   crime  [...] is completely untrue. Crime existed long before guns ever did. The only thing that taking guns out of the hands of criminals (if that were even possible) and   law  -abiding citizens would do is change the weapon that criminals use. And accepting an increase in ""general violence"" is not an acceptable side effect of banning guns. What people continue to forget is that the guns are already in the hands of criminals, have always been in the hands of criminals and will continue to be in the hands of criminals. There is still no credible study linking   gun control   and reduction in crime. Until there is, gun control advocates are standing on very shaky ground."
2,"Can you please provide a credible study that shows that more people are killed by   legal   gun owners than are killed by criminals using   guns  ? And how many instances of innocent bystanders being injured or killed by someone using their gun legally in the defense of their lives or the lives of their loved ones, especially when compared to those same situations where no innocent bystanders were injured or killed?Also, can you find a study that shows that   law  -abiding carry permit holders commit crimes at anywhere near the rate of the general population? I can only find statistics that show that permit holders are at least 100 times less likely to commit violent crimes, including those with guns.And if   gun control   is a   crime   and safety issue, then why does the anti-gun agenda continuously ignore credible statistics (not from the NRA) that show that gun control does not lead to a decline in violent crime? In fact, FBI statistics show a tendency in the opposite direction. Despite hundreds of federal and state laws, criminals continue to find ways to get guns. But you want me to give mine up so that only the criminals can be armed? I think I'll pass, thank you very much. Can you also provide the questions that were asked that pointed to the ""fact"" that the majority of Americans do not want guns on our streets? My guess is the question had nothing to do with legal gun ownership by law-abiding citizens who were subjected to background checks, state-mandated training, and hundreds of dollars in fees to obtain a legal carry permit.""No matter how many malls, schools, churches and public gatherings get attacked by gun wielding maniacs...""Gun wielding maniacs is right. There are approximately 1.5 million defensive uses of   firearms   every year. There are a couple of mass killings per year by ""gun wielding maniacs."" And these gun wielding maniacs will acquire their guns legally or illegally, whether you strip me of my right or not. But I should be left completely defenseless? I can't see a sane argument for that. "
2,"I'm going to go ahead and make a generalization about delinquent gun use, stealing it from home or wherever,     drug     and     alcohol     abuse, low test scores, promiscuous pre-marital sex, etc etc etc. Where are     mom     and dad in all this? Maybe working their butts off to pay the huge mortgage, three cars, and snowmobiles up to their eyes in     debt    . That's just one reason. The home is losing it's place as a priority in peoples lives. Crime goes up, the NEED for a gun to defend yourself also rises too. Why don't we let     guns     alone until we can lower the divorce rate eh?"
2,"The most violent, tragic school tragedy in American History was the Bath School Disaster of 1927. 45 were killed and 58 wounded, most of which were children younger than 6th grade.It was perpetrated by Andrew Kehoe, A school board member who was upset over a property tax increase. He used a series of explosions to carry out his deadly deed.Don't talk about ease of committing terrible atrocities without reviewing, mourning, and respecting the most tragic one of its kind to occur in our nation. Do not imply that the tragic events of school shootings are limited to teen perpetrators- that is false. Do not say teens commonly experiment with drugs and alcohol, and then making a suggestive statement like teens often think of suicide. Those things may all be true- but are not all true of each other. Your mixing a series of different studies from different samples and presenting a picture that is not representative of American Culture.Of course the presence of a gun would increase the likelihood of injury in those circumstances- your talking about a suicidal, homicidal, drug addicted, intoxicated, mentally unstable, depressed person. The presence of a shoe string would increase that person's likelihood of injury.your taking the most extreme, hypothetical, deranged situation- stripping inconvenient facts- and trying to present it as some form of reality. thats not debating- its generating  a fiction."
2,"A ban would create blackmarkets in arm trade. These blackmarkets could be directly linked with other illicit trading, such as narcotics, and could become a source of added revenue for organized crime and drug trafficking. 
"
1,"How many school shootings are ""acceptable""? I think the NRA's answer diverges wildly from the majority of the population. Kids aren't made safer at school with guns easily available to their classmates or the people that decide to wander in.The issues are1) possession of guns are totally in our legislature's control2) the majority of people would prefer that guns not be easy to possess, but because they don't pay lobbyists at the rate the gun manufacturers and owners do, legislatures ignore them over those that do contribute.3) disturbed kids and adults have proven, repeatedly, that they can use the current system to easily possess as many guns as they need to cause mass death and injury.The NRA's solution of a) reminding people they should be more responsibleb) asking the government to ensure no mentally disturbed person possesses a gun (but not by any restriction on the 2nd amendment, mind you)c) encourage the use of a background check system which they fought tooth and nail against when it was proposed and when it needs funding is a good summary of why the NRA is so reviled. None of these solutions have a realistic chance of fixing the problem. All of these points seem defensible, at first glance, and give them good cover when nobody bother reading past the headline (and most don't). But when you take a close look at what they're doing, they are simply throwing out deceptive, distracting arguments to keep guns on the streets and allow gun violence to continue unchecked.They have the gall to stand up after public shootings to say this never would have happened if the victims had been armed. As if we all desire a wild west shoot out as the best way to prevent gun violence. Or insult our intelligence by assuming we accept the idea that the average gun owner is qualified to start shooting in a public place at anyone they perceive to be a threat. Our kids have to go through metal detectors at schools, have their bags and lockers searched and other forms of security as a response to the ""need"" to keep guns on the streets. Ridiculous. Since the NRA has no shame in their valuing gun ownership privileges over innocent people's lives, it would be nice if the voters and our Congress did."
2,"lets talk about those school shootingsthose 'no guns allowed' signs don't seem to be working from the mass murderers standpoint, so maybe we should try a new approach, like right to self defense. Why shouldn't I, a PhD student, legal to carry every but campus, be afforded the same protection of my rights? why not my professors? faculty? staff?the one consistent thing about school shootings, all the honest and good people listened. Not one honest, good, person was armed- because they listened to those signs. Unfortunately, homicidal, deranged killers, ignored them- and people were slaughtered.Kids don't need to go through metal detectors cause of fa 'need' to keep guns on the street- don't make such statements. Kids go through those metal detectors to appease higher ups that their signs just need one more step to work. First we hang a no gun sign, then metal detectors, then searches, then cops in buildings. How much money, and how many lives, need to be thrown at this problem to realize WE NEED A NEW APPROACH.Columbine was committed by 2 crazy people who broke 22+ gun laws- just gun laws. we don't need more gun laws. we need to strip away the crap ones, stop new crap ones from being written, and give money to our police to do their job. How much money was wasted on those things that don't work?Most people are good and smart- and will make good, smart choices. They will do the same regarding defense of their own lives. Trust them."
1,"I was pointing out that the current system of   gun control   as advocated by the NRA is a farce - they tried to fight background checks and now fight the funding for it all the while claiming it's all we need combined with better enforcement of   gun laws   to keep everyone safe. Somehow they advocate the need for a stronger state for enforcement but actively work to limit its power through funding. It's becoming clear that no level of reasonable funding can keep   guns   out of the wrong people's hands, so let's be practical and take them off the street altogether.To your point on self-enablement: If you ask your classmates if they want you armed with a handgun in class, in the hallway, in the library and on campus paired up with your personal judgment of who poses a threat to yourself or anyone else AND granted the right to shoot at will, I will bet you a large sum of   money   they will overwhelmingly vote ""no"". A graduate student at UNC-Chapel Hill started picking off pedestrians downtown with his gun and had to be shot dead by the   police  . Good, smart choices were lacking by him.After you lose that vote, go ask your local patrolmen assigned to cover your campus if they prefer all students to be armed. If your logic is sound then they should welcome the wave of deterrence that spreads over campus. Instead, they will envision the fistfights at parties that escalate into gunfights, the drunken arguments that turn into shootings, the accident rate in dorm rooms as guns are accidentally discharged while being shown off, etc. etc. If there's one thing most   college   students lack it's a consistent supply of good, smart choices and the police on campus can cite example after example.So I agree with part of your posting - we need a new approach. That approach is banning handguns and most high powered ""assault"" rifles. Columbine was an example of how easy it is for disturbed people to not be prevented by any reasonably enforceable system from possessing the weapons needed to kill scores of people quickly. So let's stop trying to enforce unrealistic permits and background checks and just admit that it's a bad idea to let the average person possess most deadly weapons and ban their sale altogether.Your right to self-defense, by the way, remains intact. Get all the tasers you want. Load up on pepper spray and knives. You won't have the ability to kill 6 people in quick succession, but you can protect yourself. If you declare that only criminals will have guns under this proposal then I'll say you're right, but currently only criminals have   military  -grade machine guns, grenades and explosive weapons but that doesn't mean we need civilians to be armed accordingly. The trade off under a ban is that fewer criminals will have guns and their use in escalating violence from simply causing injuries to causing multiple deaths will be reduced. The process of getting guns off the street will go faster than I believe most fear - there will be heavy incentives to go after known criminals who haven't been convicted simply to put them away on an easy-to-prove gun possession charge. As black market guns become more valuable, they won't be ""wasted"" on random acts of violence. They will fall into the same category as weapons we currently reserve for the military - and noone would be afraid that common criminals would use them for everyday crimes or that mentally unbalanced people will buy them from a store or steal them from an acquaintance. "
2,"First off- Kudos to you for commenting on a thread 8 months later. I'm not joking either, that definitely shows your passion for your point of view. I respect that immensely and thank you for input, however much I disagree with it.With all due respect, I won't ask my classmates a damn thing, nor do I care about your suggestion of surveying them. I do not ask them about their activities, and they won't ask me about mine. So long as everyone is operating in a manner that is non damaging to other people and is   legal  , I could care less.And who grants someone the right to shoot at will? are you assuming because you have a gun you'll use it? Do you run pedestrians down with a car when your driving because the opportunity exists? that is a farce of an argument and you know it. If it were true, legal concealed carry permit holders would be committing mass homicides in droves already- and that just does not happen.and who said arm all students? where did that come from? no where. you invented that. No one is advocating arming everyone. it is not a logical conclusion to my argument or any argument I have seen presented on behalf of the pro-gun community. Arming everyone is a setup to your argument about criminals and   guns  . Its leading and you know it. I have more respect for you than that, don't try to slip that by me either- its kind of insulting.Why not let those people who are deemed capable by the state and pass the necessary background checks, classes, and other required steps to arm themselves- as they can everywhere else? that is what I'm suggesting. Your arguing fiercely, but your not arguing against my points. Your fighting points that your making up. and if all this violence would erupt as soon as guns were introduced, why hasn't that happened at the schools that allow students concealed carry? its been years since the students have been able to exercise their rights, and yet no incidents. . .your new approach isn't new. it failed in Australia, England, south Africa, Mexico, India and Germany. Your idea of getting rid of all guns is completely unrealistic and nothing more than an impossible fantasy. Your suggestion will fail as miserably as prohibition did.Self defense by the way, does not remain intact. Nor do my constitutional rights. Your right about criminals still having access to guns- and   military   grade ones. Why not disarm good citizens?  You want me to defend myself with a knife or a   taser   against criminals with long guns and handguns? Really? thats your idea of adequate self defense?Citizens are not going to be armed 'likewise' to the military. another made up argument on your part. You show me where citizens can buy   law   rockets, grenades, claymores, gaos,  c4, and whatever else. If bans worked- Mexico wouldn't be having the violence they have. And I know you followed the news to know that despite what early reports said, most of those guns confiscated did NOT come from US civilian markets. The military stuff came from corrupt officials outside of America doing backdoor deals for weapons given to those countries by us for their national defense. Your suggestion does nothing to fight corruption. I do not think that the availability of guns as you describe it will ever dry up. Corrupt people in key places will always exist- as will human ingenuity. A determined person can make some really nasty weapons pretty easily with things available around the house that can kill or hurt an awful lot of people. You can't legislate away all of these things. It is impossible.lets assume your right- and reducing   gun sales   will limit criminals- then why did fatal stabbings go up in England after a gun ban, when violence across the board ALSO went up? if knives are so much less lethal, why did it kill more officers?Your willing to trade our rights and our lives for a future Utopian dream that will not, i fear, ever happen. I cannot agree with your assessment. We both want the same thing- less criminals committing acts of violence, we just disagree on how to accomplish it. I have yet to see anything that is remotely convincing to show me that guns cause higher levels of violence. Everything that seems to even begin to point that direction has imaginary statistics and completely misleading (intentionally) statements.I feel your assessment shows a lack of trust in your fellow citizens- and one I do not agree with. "
1,"So here's one point we clearly disagree on - if the majority of your students don't want you armed in the classroom they are sharing with you, then I believe you shouldn't be armed. I would extend that to a city, state or nation. Guns allow people to perpetrate violence and kill other people on a large scale and with little effort. Their utility to   society   is negligible compared to anything else that kills at the same rate and yes, I'm assuming the ""millions"" of self-assessed crimes prevented by gun owners are in fact not real and that the true number is much, much lower. Since the most significant effect of your gun is on the people around you I think they get to make the call.My analogy of arming everybody was to refute your logic that we need a new approach to stop school shootings and that approach is to allow students to be armed at school. At some point funding the   police   better was also raised but didn't seem to get much airtime so I focused on why arming a civilian population, especially   college   students, was a bad idea. In general most people's judgment, even those people that pass a background check, shouldn't be used to decide who gets shot. There are alot of people I'd like to see use their drivers license as well, but luckily   cars   have been designed to not kill people. The exact opposite is true of   guns  . The ""cars kill alot of people so why not ban them?"" argument also tries to make an object with high social utility and some harmful side effects like a car equivalent to an object designed to kill people. All the drivers I've ever encountered have never tried to argue that the lethal ability of their car will deter   crime   and everyone should rest easier knowing they can run over anyone they sense is a criminal threat. Yet somehow you argue your personal ability to kill people with a gun should be protected because it involves the same level of judgment as operating a car.Please take the foreign country examples to their logical conclusion. No developed country (those with a reasonable chance to enforce things like a ban on   gun sales  ) has a gun or violent crime rate even approaching the US. The UK, Germany and Australia are all good examples. In the short term economic factors drive crime much more than gun ownership rates. And I'm sure stabbings went up as gun availability went down. I'd have to argue India, Mexico and South Africa are all developing countries where the rule of   law   is still evolving. You should measure their effectiveness of collecting   taxes  , enforcing building codes and stopping corruption while you're at it."
2,"We agree on some things- violent   crime   in general in the US is higher than a lot of places- even if you remove gun violence (  murder   rate for instance) As far as developed nations go, we are fairly violent. I think that is by in large the result of our immense diversity. I forget the paper, but there was a study some time ago that suggested homogeneity in a population is less violent than a heterogeneous mix like we have here.The UK, Germany, and Austrailia all have much lower populations, much more 'similar' populations, and still suffer the effects of violence. I concede I didn't make this point clearly- but what I was getting at is that even in a situation that is far more controllable with a much lower population, I don't feel the controls your suggesting work.As for the driver thing- I agree its a crap analogy- but its one most people are familiar with. I think a better analogy was when I compared it to   alcohol   and prohibition. Though we do not have a constitutional right to alcohol like we do   guns  - if I follow your logic they are equivalent. Neither is necessary in your mind and does more harm than good.If I can make that assumption- then I have to say I don't think your style of control will work. I just feel like history more supports my argument.I was just looking at some numbers on line- and maybe we can meet in the middle.Comparing NYC to London- populations are within 1 million people of each other, with NYC being slightly larger. Police budgets are close when you switch with current exchange rates.however- London has 7x the amount of crime NYC has. (mind you the UK doesn't tally offenses committed by offenders under the age of 16). whats the big difference? NYC has 40% more cops patrolling than London. Now maybe crime is grossly under reported in NYC. I lived there for 5.5 years- and I would believe that there is some definate under reporting going on to make it look safer than it is- but I'm not sure even if you inflate the rate for NYC and deflate London for some reason that they would be close. If any of my point is to be considered let it be this: Gun control is an expensive exercise that at best strips people of rights, and at worst is an exercise in futility that does not reduce violent crime.Even if the US numbers of crimes prevented with guns is inflated- by say 50 fold, than that estimated 2 million preventions still becomes 40,000- 4x higher than the US murder rate in 2007 with guns (just over 10,000) over a nearly 700 of which, were justifiable shootings by   law     enforcement and civilians in self defense cases.I think your focusing on the violent crime rate in the US and equating that to gun crime- and they just aren't the same.I disagree with your methods, but maybe we can both agree that our   money   as tax payers, our safety as people, and our rights as citizens are best protected by something that isn't   gun control  ."

Not reaching for a heart string there or anything. . . but I digress- your building a straw man argument. you offer no actual data and create a fictional scenario, which then interject at the end, You wouldn't want your kids to see this, would you? So congratulations on reading traditional propaganda techniques. If you guys want some other literature to molest and twist around, I recommend Ellul's PROPAGANDA.

Eliminating all guns? let me build a little scenario for you-remember that thing in America way back when called Prohibition? By making a desirable, but if misused dangerous commodity illegal- the US Government created a situation where it was SO profitable to break the law and provide this illegal item that it gave rise to organized crime and distribution of products on the black market that this country had never before seen.so how would that work with guns? If made illegal- they would become so desirable an underground economy (one that already exists, you would just be empowering it) would explode with traffic from the criminal element in our country.so who wouldn't have guns? Honest citizens who obey laws, even when they are unjust.who would have guns? Criminals. laws didn't prevent them before- and now you just made it more profitable for them to traffic their wares.To suggest that the gun lobby is driven by capitalism and not have anything to do with National history, American Rights, or in my personal opinion- good sense- is asinine.Outlawing fire-extinguishers doesn't prevent crime. Nor does cutting down in their availability. To limit the flow of firearms will not cut down in violent crime- at best it will manifest itself in a different, and probably more violent form- at worst, it will be business as usual, just fewer good men and women will have an opportunity to resist and protect their way of life."

2," I think the underlying problems is not that there are too many   guns  , on the other hand there are too many criminals. We want to blame an inanimate object for the obvious failure of the   parenting   skills of a large part of the population. Lets start at the root of the problem, we are raising our   children   to be criminals. Criminals that steal, rob and rape and   murder  . If these people were raised to value human life, who were raised to KNOW the difference between right and wrong, to stay away from those who do not, and raised their voices when they saw the law being broken, then we would not have the need to carry guns. Its not the guns that should be regulated its the parenting skills of people who do not get involved in their children's lives. These   kids   run the streets  following the gangs, listening to music that glorifies the types of behaviors that we as a   society   abhor. And we question why they wound up dead in front of a liquor store. Was it a gun that killed your teen son?  NO!  IT WAS YOU!  You had the responsibility to raise him to be an upright young man and YOU FAILED! Don't blame guns, look in the mirror. Your child is why I must carry a gun to protect my life and the safety of my loved ones"
1," Semi-automatic weapons do not serve a sporting purpose. Semi-automatic weapons original purpose are for shooting and killing humans, not game animals. In addition, is there any legitimate reason to want to involve assault weapons in the sport of hunting. First, the mass killing of game could be considered a violation of animal rights. At a minimum, this kind of activity does not seem to be much of a challenging sport. Rather, it would appear to make the maximization of the killing of game the primary objective, over the art of making a skillful kill.

2,"Anthropologist David Kennedy (John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York) has determined in city after city that less than 0.5% of the population on average is responsible for over 75% of the homicides.  When those individuals are addressed, violence in the first year of the interdiction program typically drops by half.We don't need to control guns to address violence, we need to control criminals.    http://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/418838    "
2,"Howdy Hecate,Until the Justice system starts handing down penalies that suit the crime and start removing the criminal element from society, I just keep my guns.

2,"Your argument makes the supposition that gun laws are universal throughout the nation. The Highest murder rates, and violence rates involving guns in the US are (rather obviously) In large metropolitan areas. By referencing Scalia's decision, you cannot ignore the fact that, Washington DC, one of the most violent places in the United States, has extremely strict laws prohibiting gun ownership. Therefore, if gun laws worked, by your logic, wouldn't Washington DC be one of the safest places in America? By your logic, then Philadelphia would also be a very safe city.Gun Control is an attempt at treating a symptom of a greater ailment.  "
2," Last time I checked, the Swiss had a higher rate of gun ownership than we here in the States and they enjoy one of the lowest gun related crime rates in the world."
2,"I am curious, was it the guns that the crips/bloods have make them violent? Was it the guns that the Hells Angels possess make them violent? Are the guns the MS-13 have the reason they are so violent? Remember when skinheads just kicked the crap out of people? I wonder if their steel-toed boots suddenly make them violent? Is it just possible that it is the inherent, violent proclivity of some people the real problem. While I would agree that the act of killing and robbing may be easier when the bad guy has a gun, but if I have a gun as well (which I do) and I have some training (which I do, and I advocate training and regular practice) my chances of surviving a negative encounter with a robber or killer is greatly improved. However, my theory about the miraculous removal of all guns from private ownership would simply result in attacks by a greater force from which I could not defend i.e. more bad guys acting in concert against one person. With a firearm I am a formidable opponent; without one I am a victim and a statistic. I plan on being neither.As to the issue of common sense, I have yet to hear from the gun control group ANYTHING that even comes close to common sense when it comes to limiting my ability to defend myself and my family. I don't see any common sense in limiting me to one-gun-per-month schemes. When I lived in SoCal most gun owners took that to mean, not a limitation of one-gun-per-month, but a requirement of one-gun-per-month. Many of us purchased many more guns than we normally would have due to that limitation. This was especially true in the case of collectors of hard to find, out of production firearms. At one point I had as many as nine guns paid for but I couldn't take possession of them. I had to wait months before I could bring them home. In almost every case these guns were unsuited for anything but collecting but there was no provision in the law for that. Explain the ""common-sense"" in that? I'll tell you what common sense is. Common sense is educating responsible, law-abiding gun owners, the ones who buy one gun for home defense, about gun safety. Oops, the NRA does that already. So why is the NRA so demonized and vilified? As a former peace officer I fully support a person's right to own a firearm and common sense does not mean you should be able to do anything to infringe on my right and ability to defend myself and protect my family."
2,"Are there more guns out there today?  Yes there is....and a lot more.If more guns equal more deaths, why has the death rate decreased about 40% in the governments latest statistics.Japan is a homogenious society that has thousands of years social structure unlike these United States.  Yes they have few guns.  Yes, the suicide rate is much higher than ours.Austrailia, Great Britain, and Canada have greatly restricted or banned most firearms and now are experiencing a huge increase in crime compared to before the restrictions.  Remember when the Bobbies didn't carry firearms?  What has changed?"
1,"As an Australian, I have to correct your generalisation that there has been a huge increase in   crime  . This is for the most part, factually untrue. If you look at the links below, you will see that property crime has been trending downwards in the last few years (  http://www.aic.gov.au/topics/property/stats  /), while only Assault has risen among violent crimes (  http://www.aic.gov.au/topics/violence/stats  /). Irrespective of the statistical aspects, the fact remains that gun related violence is really very rare in Australia. When people do commit violent crimes, they use   firearms   in only around 15% of cases (  http://www.aic.gov.au/stats/crime/keyFacts_handguns.html  ). In any case, even before the bans of 1996 and 2001 (which applied to automatics, semi-automatic rifles, pump-action shotguns, and high capacity semi-automatic pistols),  there has never been a   law   permitting private citizens to carry firearms of any sort on their person for any reason, so it isn't as if people stopped carrying   guns   or keeping them in their homes to not having them at all. "
2,"SUPGV, Aren't you the one in another post who said ""Causal effect is always hard to determine""?  Yet here you're making a blanket statement that more   guns   equal more violence.  It's funny how that whole double-standard thing works with anti-gunners.  To paraphrase your comments in ""Fewer Guns in North East..."", Did more guns really lead to MORE   crime   or were there many other factors such as DOWNTURNS in the   economy  , LESS aggressive policing, LOWER incarceration rates, INCREASE in crack cocaine use? Just a thought..."
2,"Are we worried more about violent crimes, or just crimes with   guns  ?  Does it make sense to expect that   crime   would go down with less guns, or merely that gun crimes would go down with less guns?  It seems to me that crime is the issue, not guns. Let's look at some facts about gun usage:  http://www.justfacts.com/guncontrol.asp    http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=118x155031  "
2,"My sense of the Pro Gun/ Anti Gun disagreements are mostly because each side is referring to something different. What makes that important is each side seems to be doing the wrong things for the right reasons. It seems to me we (both sides of the alleged issue) should get on the same page.The anti gun folk are concerned about firearm violence and see outlawing or restricting   firearms   as a solution. The pro gun side doesn't want bans and further restrictions. The problem is both are missing the mark. The problem is violence. Both sides would be overjoyed if the problem of violence were addressed. Proposing outlawing or restricting firearms does not address violence. Supporting 2nd amendment rights does not address violence. I think you see where I am going here.There is a goal displacement in the issue(s) and proposals to resolve them. Nowhere in the anti gun proposals are any solutions to violence and a whole raft of other issues that are not addressed by the application of anti firearm legislation. It may me my mental defects that cause me to question why would anyone want to do something that can't possibly work and only tends to irritate folks who are not a threat. It is one of them there ""Same action, same result."" It's gotta make you wonder.  Like Einstein's definition of Insanity: doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results."
2,"Assault weapons are consistent with hunting for foot. The art or form of hunting was originated from obtaining a form of food, so it does not really matter how the kill takes place. Semi-automatic weapons makes it easier to operate a weapon so that you can kill game. The weapons, therefore, are a completely legitimate form of hunting. 
"
2,"Firstly, about half of all gun deaths are suicides. There are numerous studies that show there is no correlative link between suicide rate and availability of a specific means, let alone a causative one. So we're now down to 15,000 deaths a year, the vast majority of which occur in inner cities where highly invasive gun control laws are the norm. Clearly they are having no effect. In point of fact, there is not a single reliable and valid study out there that shows even a medium correlation between gun control laws and a reduced violence rate."
2,"First off, have you ever heard of fighting fire with fire? Certainly there are way to many criminals with guns. That is ONE of the reasons I own guns. I have been a gun owner for 39 years, since I was 16 years old. During that time I have owned a couple of guns (all you anti gun folks would probably have apoplexy if you knew how many and I'm a piker as I know people who own 300 and 500 guns). So, would you say my friends and have too many guns? And if so, on what do you base that determination? Further, what gives you the right? I am a former peace officer. I have never used a gun illegally. At the risk of sounding immodest, my expertise with firearms is above that of the average police officer (but less compared to other folks I know). I once knew a federal cop who competed in local shooting matches because the firearms training he received was inadequate. He knew that the rest of the people participating in these matches had training and experience that far surpassed his training. As a private person I have used a firearm to prevent assaults on my person on two occasions and as an off-duty police officer I have stopped one potential assault against me and my companion and I stopped an assault in progress of a neighbor and his friend. Actually, two men were in the process of beating them to death with a gold club and baseball bat. Those two people were defenseless and would have been killed had I not intervened, with a handgun. And guess what, it was not necessary to shoot any of the assailants. All of the assailants saw the wisdom of reconsidering their actions, immediately and without question. I currently have a permit to carry a firearm concealed and I never leave home without my permit and gun. I could continue like this for some time. My main point here is to question the qualifications of any person who is anti gun to responsibly comment or lecture me about any aspect of private gun ownership. Verified expert indeed."
2,By your unverified statistics there is 1 death per 9333   guns  . FARS (  http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx  ) reported that in 2007 there was 1 death per 5523 cars. A car is 59% more likely to kill then a gun.Ban cars instead.
2,"You seem to confuse a fact with the truth. All a fact is is a piece of data. One must consider the nature of the data before one can proclaim it supports an underlying truth. Let us do so with your facts, even though I see not a single source for them.""Each time a gun is used in a legally-justifiable shooting in a home, there are 22 unintentional, criminal, and suicide-related shootings.""In order to have this 'fact', such as it is, support the underlying truth that guns are bad, we must accept three things. The first is that a legally justified shooting is the valid measure to use when making a cost/benefit analysis of them. It is not, because of the simple fact that a law abiding citizen who brandishes his gun in self defense is much less likely to fire in the first place because his objective is to drive the aggressor off which many times will not require an actual discharge of the weapon. The second is that suicides are a valid statistic to include in this debate. As I noted earlier they really aren't. The third is that we must accept the fact's definition of legally-justified shooting. Given that in Chicago, if the shooting is done with the handgun it cannot be legally justifiable, we see that this is a very sloppy 'fact' indeed.""Having a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide fivefold.""Just from reading this statistic I can with 99% certainty guarantee that the study that came up with it is neither scientifically valid or reliable. Firstly, the study certainly does not control for legal or illegal gun ownership. Secondly, the study does not control for illegal drug use on behalf of the suicide. Thirdly and finally, the statistic does not even control with whether the suicide was committed with the gun or not.""Having a gun in the home triples the risk of homicide in the home.""Again, this statistic certainly does not control for legal or illegal gun ownership. Neither does it control for method of homicide."
2,No sources cited.  Rather poorly constructed argument.
2,"If you put a loaded gun on the table, it will not harm anybody. It takes a person to look someone in the eye, point a gun at them, and pull the trigger. People do kill people, not guns. By your logic, we should ban cars because of some of the imbeciles we have on the road today."
1,"While the oft touted phrase, ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people."", is used to separate the act from the object, the fact is that   firearms   act as a facilitator of violence. The simple fact is that access to firearms makes it much easier for people to kill one another. In many cases, the presence of a firearm escalates a situation from an otherwise non-fatal incident into a homicide. So while it is technically true that firearms do not kill people in-and-of themselves, they make it much easier for people to kill each other. However, this is not to say that firearms cannot have a role in preventing violence, but rather that the relationship between firearms and the occurrence of violence is more complex than it appears."
2,"Someone once said to me in a discussion about concealed carrying of   firearms   that ""Only police should have   guns  "" I said ""Ok lets look at that. Police have the responsibility to keep the civil peace and solve crimes, not prevent them. Crimes are not preventable. The robber or rapist is not going to be deterred by police programs or fear of arrest, he has already made the decision to commit a   crime  . The odds of police interference are remarkably low. The odds of actually getting caught for a   murder   are 1 in 14. The responsibility for your own safety is ultimately yours, not the police. I choose to carry a   firearm   to protect myself and those I love. By being in proximity to me you are also being protected, as I can prevent a rapist or robber from harming you. Carrying a gun is a heavy burden, I have made the decision to take human life if necessary to protect myself with all of the emotional and physical baggage this entails. If you were being assaulted I guarantee that you would be praying for someone with a gun to help you and stop the perpetrators.I do not choose to carry a gun to take lives, I carry a gun to save lives, Maybe even yours"
1,"The math you have used is all wrong. You multiplied instead of dividing. Using your figure of 5.6 per 100k and assuming that firearm ownership triples the rate, then the rate in homes NOT owning a firearm would be 1/3 of  5.6, which is 1.86 (repeating).But even so, it doesn't work that way, because the figure of 5.6 per 100k is a mathematical average based on national data. It does not reflect the situation in any given household. Its like saying that 45% of Americans own a dog. That does not mean that 45% of every household has a dog (or that every household has 45% of a dog!). To generate meaningful data, you would have to do a study of the homicide rate in households with and without a gun, in a sample population. The data from national   crime   rate reports is too general to draw those kinds of specific conclusions. "
1,"I disagree that the study I suggested would be meaningless. If the study were carried out across a range of areas with similar demographics, in homes with and without   guns  , you could isolate the gun variable to a reasonable degree. Obviously you cannot control for all the extraneous variables and you couldn't categorically say that the rate in homes with guns is X% and in homes without guns it is Y%, but you would be able to determine if there is a visible trend difference. But to a certain extent you are correct in that statistics are easy to distort, and tend to be shaped by how the question is framed."
2,"Semi-automatic weapons has not decimated animal populations. People have been using semi-automatic weapons for years and have not caused not making a big dent i game account so we are just balancing the population with using these weapons. 
"
2,"There are three kinds of lies.  Lies, damned lies and statistics."
2,"If you REALLY want to evaluate statistics, read John Lott or Ralph Cramer.  THEY have correct statistics.  One of which is; The actual number of weapons in America has INCREASED over the past ten years and the number of violent acts with a weapon has DECREASED. That alone belies the whole premise.The actual number of times that a weapon is used to prevent a   crime   is estimated between one million and two million times a year AND most of them did not require firing the weapon."
2,"It is a sad fact that some do harm themselves and loved ones with guns.  They also do it more often with automobiles but I digress.  To blame the availability of a thing is to miss the point entirely.  It's a lazy dodge to blame the inanimate object for the foibles of humanity.  It's not unlike blaming the alcoholic for having a mouth in which to pour the source of their affliction.  We tried prohibition and you see what that got us; rum runners, gang wars, criminalizing the average citizen, etc.  Your suppositions hold as much water as a colander.  In the latest data which was done in 2006, the percentage of ALL gun deaths in the home where either a family member or acquaintance was killed equaled 2%.  Agreed, that’s too many.  BUT, for the same period involving ALL gun deaths via police on innocents, try 10%!  So, if we’re to bandy stats for the sake of argument, where do you have a better chance of getting whacked?  Excuse me, but I’ll think I’ll stay home tonight… with my guns."
1,What are samples from which these percentages are drawn and who did the data collection in 2006? It's impossible to evaluate your statements based on what you have written here.
2,His statistics are just as valid as anything the FSA is claiming.
1,"These may very well be legitimate statistics. However, BLZeebub hasn't provided us with enough information to even know that the 2% if of. All I am asking for is clarification.Is s/he trying to say that 10% of all police fatalities are of innocent victims?that 2% of all fatalities in a residential property are family or friends?And if so, what's the source? I can provide sources for very different statistics and so I'm wondering how they compare. If you want to have your arguments taken seriously you have to provide that much at least. If these are self-reported data from members of the NRA, I'm likely to take them with a grain of salt. If they are data lifted from government crime databases (such as the annual CDC reports) by a nonpartisan group, I'll take them more seriously."
2,"There are several statistical problems with the claim that a household with a gun is at added risk. The biggest problem is including households with convicted criminal gun owners in the pool--People who are already breaking existing gun laws.  Being a felon is extremely risky, roughly half of all murder victims are convicted felons.  If you were to separate the law-abiding gun owners from armed criminal households, the numbers would look much different.  It is difficult to determine which homes are truly gun-free--Many people will not admit to having guns, either in fear of prosecution, or fear of theft, so many ""nonviolent gun"" homes get counted as ""nonviolent gun-free"".   On the other hand, it is easy to determine that a house where gun violence occurred had a gun in it. "
1,"The study was measuring how guns are used, not does having them enable use.One of the NRA's bedrock claims is that having guns on the street makes us safer, and that gun owners use their guns overwhelmingly to prevent crime. Shouldn't this study have concluded that a gun in the house, when shot at somebody, is almost always used to shoot a criminal if this was true? How could guns be killing innocent people, even suicidal people, at such a higher rate than criminals? Suicidal people should be a minor blip in the results compared to criminal deaths if the NRA claims are true. But they're not.Ask your insurance company what your life insurance and homeowners rate is once you keep a gun in the house and compare that to no gun. Keep in mind they don't pay out for suicide. They will raise your rate on the impassionate, calculated risk that the gun will be used to hurt/kill someone by accident to a much higher degree than the gun will lower your risk of theft or assault."
2,"Maybe it's because suicidal people don't run when a gun is pointed at them.  Bearing in mind that criminals are a small subset of people as a whole, as are suicidal persons, it's a safe bet that people who put the barrel to their temple are more likely to get hit than those who duck and run.  Also, the law-abiding citizens of the world generally don't fire on the ones who run away, because they are no longer a threat.  We also don't fire on the ones who surrender, because they're no longer a threat.  If we fire, it's because the attack continued after the gun was presented, which is an overwhelming minority of cases."
2,"""Shouldn't this study have concluded that a gun in the house, when shot at somebody, is almost always used to shoot a criminal if this was true? How could   guns   be killing innocent people, even suicidal people, at such a higher rate than criminals?

There are plenty of studies that show that guns are used far more to prevent   crime   than commit it. But since you seem to be privy to the only known study that shows otherwise, perhaps you wouldn't mind sharing it with the rest of us?"

2,"Not really. While the success rate of different suicide methods is not in doubt the fact remains that if you are using pills or cutting to try and kill yourself, you're not all that serious about suicide. I would love to see a link the the research that actually shows even a medium correlation between gun ownership and suicide risk. The biggest study on this at your means matter site classifies New Hampshire as being a low gun prevalence state. This shows that their method of collecting data was flawed, to say the least."
2,"Many suicide attempts are not really meant to end a life, rather they are a call for help. These people typically don't pick a reliable method.  Most people who pick a gun mean to die--If a firearm were not easily available, they would pick another effective method.  Another aspect of this is a fairly significant difference in philosophy, separate from the gun issue--Self-reliance vs. dependence on authority.  The idea that because I may harm myself I should be prevented from doing something reinforces dependence.  Letting me judge the risks myself and make my own decisions is self-reliance. "
2,"Access to guns may increase the likelihood that a committed suicidal person will choose that method over another, but it does not affect the suicide rate over all.

2,"This question even coming up is just a peculiarity of the system.It's a pointless superfluous question covered by previous debate.The only reason we are asking about   national parks   is because of strategic   legal   influence on the part of the special interests involved combined with a quirk of our political system. Specifically, the lack of requirement of bill amendments to be pertinent to the bill as a whole at certain points during   the law   enactment process.Gun control advocates know that they'll never get   guns   banned en masse, so they'll try first to get them banned in places where they are not likely to be opposed. Classic slippery slope approach.A firearm does not care who owns the land it is on. Nor is safety impacted by such ownership. This is a non-issue, from all logical perspectives. As an important side note...I would like to   add   that the true character of the gun debate is overlooked here as well as virtually everywhere else.We do not have the   second amendment   to defend ourselves from criminals or to hunt.The second amendment is not intended to defend American citizens from hunger or   crime  , but to protect them from the American government should that defense be required.Gun control advocates like to talk about the founding fathers thinking the 2nd amendment applied to muskets not M16s and grenades, but keep in mind that the musket was the M16 of the day. ""Arms"" in the context of constitutional rights means equipment capable of allowing armed insurrection should that become the will of the majority. Put another way ""Arms"" in this context mean   assault weapons  ,   military   weapons, not hunting or home defense tools.To forget that fact is to invite future oppression and to perpetuate ignorance.""But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.""  - The Declaration of Independence"

1,"""The   second amendment   is not intended to defend American citizens from   hunger   or   crime   , but to protect them from the American government should that defense be required.""Hm, that sounds a bit like something you made up.  The actual verbiage of the amendment is as follows:""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""So, you might interpret that to mean states defending themselves against the Federal government, but mostly it sounds like having weapons for use in a, er, well regulated militia.  Well regulated.  Not a bunch of loners carrying around concealed weapons who fancy themselves as some kind of frontier justice."

Even if we didn’t have that ruling if you looked up the definition of militia in US Law you would find that it is defined as any able bodied person between 17 and 45 that can be called on in times of crises to repel invasion or enforce the laws of the United States, so we could still carry weapons even with your incorrect interpretation. Going even farther if that didn’t basically include everyone all ready and you looked into the 1770’s definition of “well regulated” you would find that it is defined as being well equipped/supplied and has nothing to do with regulations or training. You should also look into who actually carries concealed weapons because you don’t seem to understand who these people are. You would be surprised to find that it’s not usually who you think. Doctors, Lawyers, Businessmen/women, Judges, College Students, Small business owners and other upstanding members of the community all carry concealed weapons because they recognize that the world is not a perfect place and that the cops aren’t under any   legal   statute to protect any individual citizen (Warren Vs District of Colombia).  Remember to get a permit in most states you need to go through training, in all states pass a state and federal background check and be over the age of 21(also depending on the state) In the United States the ratio is close to one concealed weapon permit holder to every one hundred citizens.  All of the people I know that are concealed weapon carriers don’t want to be lone wolf one person swat teams they would rather go about their business in a peaceful manner. They recognize that it might be better to stand by and be a good witness than try and pull some heroic crap and get themselves or others killed but when need be they have come to terms with the fact that they may have to kill another human being (or animal in this case) to defend their lives or the lives of those they care about. So sorry to burst your bubble that you believe that no   crime   can touch you but it can and those that wish to protect themselves are the only ones you are trying to hurt. The verbiage used in the previous comment is absolutely correct, the 2nd Amendment was written to keep the citizens of the United States free of Tyranny from any government including our own according to the Supreme Court and founding fathers. So please before telling someone else they are wrong or made something up do some research and then come debate, we will be more than happy to discuss any other issues you see with this piece of legislation that finally gives citizens the legal standing to uphold a right we already had.

1,"In your previous post you wrote:""The   second amendment   is not intended to defend American citizens from   hunger   or   crime   , but to protect them from the American government should that defense be required.""And then in your reply to my post you wrote:""So sorry to burst your bubble that you believe that no crime can touch you but it can and those that wish to protect themselves are the only ones you are trying to hurt.""Now, your ignorance regarding my view of crime notwithstanding, are you adding a feature of the second amendment or are you changing your mind what it's for?I'm ambivalent about   guns  .  I'm quite positive, however, that the more people that carry concealed guns we have the higher the accidental death rate and   murder   rate will go.  When you get people carrying them everywhere they are always available when you've had one too many drinks or you get upset with another driver or you happen to fly into a jealous rage.I'm considering getting some weapons myself, in case you are curious.  I would hate to have all the primitive people around me (read NRA members and criminals) being the only armed ones."
2,"Kelly,I am ignorant? You don’t even realize you are debating two different people. I never stated ""The   second amendment   is not intended to defend American citizens from   hunger   or   crime  , but to protect them from the American government should that defense be required."" that was the other persons statement not my own. So I never changed anything I simply added on to what was previously written BY SOMEONE ELSE. Since you took the stance that the 2nd Amendment was only for militias I wrote to counter that argument you put forth.  Which I completely agree, that was its original purpose and still very valid today. I also believe that like knives and hammers and any other tool a firearm is simply that a tool that can be used for good or bad. It is people who are evil not inanimate objects. Now you are moving completely over to the emotional side stating that the   murder   rate and death rate will increase with   firearms  . Can you back up this so called fact? Or did you just assume that is what would happen without again doing any research. How about you actually look up a few of the studies on Concealed Carry (I will leave a few at the end of this for you). Out of all the studies ever done on Concealed Carry in the US not one has shown an increase in crime or rates of death by firearms, not one. Not even the ones done by liberal slanted professors. I am not even going to bring up all the international studies which yet again show the same thing(that   guns   are not the problem) but in my opinion don’t point to a clear stance all they prove is that different countries have different socio-cultural composites that tend to affect crime rates way more than the availability of firearms. But yet again you show your ignorance of   the law   and utter lack of proper research by bringing up the whole drinking while carrying rant. This is for you and everyone else out there that is attempting to hang on to this fallacy IT IS ILLEGAL!!! I will admit that a few states allow you to drink and carry but they are the overwhelming minority and have shown your argument to be false even when   legal  . I don’t know any permit holder that would put their right to carry in jeopardy for a drink. Yes these people went through the training and background checks and paid the   money   to the state just to go have a beer and lose that right?  Yet again show me one instance where someone with a Concealed Carry Permit got drunk and did something stupid with their firearms. I do restrict this to people who have permits only and are not also   police   officers I found a few instances of officers being drunk with a gun and causing trouble but not an average citizen and officers are allowed to carry guns everywhere and are not seen as dangerous. I can’t seem to find one and I currently live in Idaho for school, where it is legal to carry into a Bar and to a certain point drink while carrying (the law is fuzzy).  It’s the same thing with the whole jealous rage ploy. It doesn’t happen now so why would carrying onto a public park change that? Do we someone become different people in National Parks and we want to kill everything?? You are just regurgitating the same pathetic ranting that was brought up ten years ago when Concealed Carry Laws where first passed even after ten years there is still no basis to this argument. Do you really believe that if that ever did happen the news would be all over that, they would be eating that up. It would be plastered on every major news station how some idiot with a permit got drunk and shot up some place and he had a permit to carry the firearm legally. Also I ask that you leave out stories with people who happen to live in a state that requires you to have a permit to own a firearm (blatantly against the 2nd I might   add  )  it is not the same thing and does not give a person a right to carry only to own.I am glad you are thinking of buying a few weapons but I do suggest going to range for the proper training first so you don’t become a danger to yourself and others like you assume everyone else to be. I also thoroughly resent your last statement I am neither an NRA member nor a criminal, you are stereotyping an entire group by the actions of a few which is a very narrow minded way to look at the world. Yet again I am placing my name at the bottom so you realize who you are debating with.LOUIS"
2,"Kelly,I forgot to   add   those studies to the bottom of my post that I mentioned earlier. Here is a great collection of gun myths debunked, the   concealed carry   section starts on page 44.  http://gunfacts.info/pdfs/gun-facts/5.1  /gun-facts-5.1-screen.pdfand every claim is given with the proper citation.Here is one international one from Australia that shows you the what happens when   guns   are outlawed and only the criminals have guns.  http://www.geoffmetcalf.com/aus.html  Great Britain is now in teh same boat. After banning all   firearms   knife   crime   went up so much that they are now outlawing any knife over 4 inches. Goes to show you that criminals will still attack and kill no matter what is made illegal. Here is a great one entitled ""40 Reasons to support Gun Control"" there are actually over 300 reasons but its a good one.   http://www.political-humor.org/40Reasons.shtml  Also look up any work by John Lott Jr. he has done more studies on firearms and their use in crime and who commits those crimes than anyone else.

2,"QUOTE ""I would hate to have all the primitive people around me (read NRA members and criminals) being the only armed ones.""Welcome to the club! WOW NRA members & criminals in the same breath, nice to know your head is on straight.Heres why these two sides of the coin will never meet.Cut & Paste Bernard Levine (c)1998  THE GREAT DIVIDE     Ever since its first European settlements, in the early 1600s,America developed as two completely different republics. We have beenpolitically divided ever since, and will always remain so. This isbecause our two founding republican traditions are both opposite andirreconcilable.      On one side of the divide were the agrarian republicans like ThomasJefferson and James Madison. They gave us the Declaration ofIndependence and the Constitution, with their foundation stones of equalcreation, personal freedom, and the inalienable rights of every citizen.Theirs was a republic of innate virtue, where   crime   and vice werenothing more than aberrations. An individual's misbehavior was only ofconcern to the State when other citizens had been harmed by it.      On the other side of the divide were the puritanical republicanslike the autocratic clergyman, Cotton Mather. These men believed allcitizens to be innate sinners, irresistibly driven to dastardly deedsunless rigidly restrained by the State. Their puritan republic, theirCity of God, was like a brittle chain, which a single weak link wouldsunder. In their world, even the slightest mis-step from pious purityhad to be prevented at all cost. Countless detailed laws and regulationswere devised, and then constantly revised, in order to eliminate everypossibility of straying. To the true puritan -- whether pious Christian,secular humanist, or leveling socialist -- notions of rights andresponsibilities are meaningless. All that matters is the prevention ofsin. No form of prior restraint can be too severe, if it advances thisfundamental goal. ====Of course the puritans never included themselves in the regulations, after all they could trust that they were above corruption....sort of like you...."

2,"There are over 40 states that allow handgun carry.  In any store, business, street corner, highway, or sidewalk you may be near a person with a handgun, concealed or not.These people are honest   law   abiding citizens that have proven themselves as such.For what reason should they be stopped from carrying in National Parks.  There is   crime   there just like everyplace else.  Handgun carriers are not there to go hunting and all arguments that they will shoot wildlife are absurd.Failure to allow self protection in our parks is just another way to restrict people and violate the Second Amendment."
2,"First, I've always wondered how and why the possession of   guns  , protected by the 2nd Amendment, is prohibited on Federal properties.  As DC v Heller made the point, if the 2nd protects anything it protects the right to own   firearms   from Federal infringement.Secondly, the panty-wetters crying in fear at the thought of   law  -abiding citizens possession firearms on federal park land under the exact same laws and regulations as the surrounding state lands are demonstrating a very childish attitude.  They'll ""be afraid to visit   national parks   knowing that people can have guns?""  How can they now find the courage to even travel to those parks knowing that they must traverse state lands where people are allowed to carry guns?  How can they manage to control their fear while shopping in local stores, walking local streets, or sitting in local theaters knowing that the state already allows people to have guns.  In my own county in a state which has had   legal   concealed carry for only the past five years, approximately 1.54% of the population has a concealed carry permit.  According to a local deputy, when one subtracts those under age or with criminal records, it's closer to 5% of the eligible population. That means that one out of every twenty adults one meets might be legally carrying a gun.  And no problems are in evidence.  How would that change if the land in nearby national parks is added to the area where those people can carry legally?  And why should it change?"
2,"Gun bans are extremel effective in ensuring that people who scrupulously follow   the law   remain unarmed.  Regrettably, gun bans tend not to have much effect on people who don't care to follow the law.  Not surprisingly, the end result is that violent criminals can ply their trade knowing that the full force and majesty of the law is doing its best to guarantee them an ample supply of unarmed victims.  If I were a professional robber, rapist or killer, I would be in favor of   gun control  , as it would be a simple matter of workplace safety for me."
1," 2nd Amendment applies only to the collective right of the militia to bear arms The language of the Second Amendment creates a situation in which the right to bear arms applies only to the militia. The second amendment reads, ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" The first clause clearly qualifies any right to bear arms as solely for the purpose of maintaining ""a well regulated militia"" for ""the security of a free state"".

2,"I wasn't exactly sure which article to put this under, but since this is recent I will use it.  I apologize that it is not particularly in response to the National Parks issue.  http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/08/18/obama.protest  .rifle/index.html""A man toting an assault rifle was among a dozen protesters carrying weapons while demonstrating outside President Obama's speech to veterans on Monday, but no laws were broken. It was the second instance in recent days in which weapons have been seen near presidential events.""I couldn't believe the article when I read it.  That is some serious 2nd ammendment protesting.  I love it really.  When was the last time you ever heard of a weapon being allowed anywhere near the POTUS?  Two things stand out so strongly:1.  Local and state   law   enforcement did not confiscate the weapon (temporarily) or remove the man from the protest. (He possessed it legally)2.  The Secret Service didn't either. (I have zero idea what they must have been thinking, other than ""Do not blink today"".In my opinion this changes the question of carrying in parks, or churches, or Starburcks to carrying an ASSAULT rifle in proximity to the POTUS.And not to make too big a point of it, but this is President Obama we are talking about.  He's not what you would call a pro-assault rifle, NRA card carrying kind of guy.  If people were carrying elephant   guns   to a Roosevelt rally, maybe I would be a little less interested.  So many different questions and thoughts ran through my head when I read the article.  I am left with:""Ain't America grand""?You may like guns, or hate them.  But what you should absolutely appreciate is that this country is indeed still free, even if it's not perfect.  If President Obama intended to send a political message on this one, please at least give him the credit for having the nerve to do it."

2,"   I live just outside Sequoia National Park in California.  I regularly go for extended hikes and   fishing   in the area.  Last year, as I was hiking up the Marble Fork Creek with my 8 year old cousin, at approximately 2.5 miles in I stumbled across a fair amount of irrigation hose running from the creek.  Long story short, I immediately realized that I was in a bad place!  It was close to September, which is near harvest time.  I pulled my cousin close to me and whispered quietly that we need to turn around and quickly hike out of the area.  The growers must have seen us, because before we were 300 yards down trail we were met with 2 men at our front with rifles and shortly a man followed from behind with a revolver.  We were held at gun point for 2-3 hours and we were terrified for our lives.  To this day I am not sure why we were released, and I am not making any judgements as to if I had a firearm whether it would have made a difference or just escalated the situation?!  I do advocate the ability to carry   firearms   in the park and personally hold a CCWP, but thought that it would be interesting to share my experience with the readers on this blog.    If I HAD to guess why we were released, I think that farmers wanted no part in harming a young child.  Had I been alone, I would have had my concealed weapon on me regardless of Federal Law. (Going over in my head what I though I would have done) I BELIEVE I would have drawn my weapon at the first sign of danger, and to guess from there is futile!  My true protection that day was in the hands of a higher power!     As I camp, hike, fish, cave, climb, pack stock and such in the National Forest surrounding this area (Legal Gun Carry Zone), I wanted to give a quick list of reasons for carrying.  1) Pack   animals  , I had a horse break it's leg and had to put it down (Sad!),  2) stalked once by a mountain lion (very rare) scared it off, 3) blew a lock off a gate at the end of a remote jeep trail (put there by people to impede travel of vehicles for environmental purposes) 5.5 hour journey to return to the trail head, 4) 2 aggressive rattle snakes that I had no way of backing down to avoid, 5) Coyotes trying to attack our 5 month old puppy and drag it out to kill from our campsite.  These are only MY personal justifications. I think it is a line in a movie but so true.  A gun is a tool, and the best reason for having one is for ""all of the reasons I can't think of!""  I would never be afraid of a   law   abiding citizen carrying a gun, it is those other characters that give me a bit of worry."

1,"Hunting isn't allowed in   national parks  , so that's not it.

No.Allowed? How come?  And please don't tell me it's your right to carry a loaded gun, we already know that.  REALLY answer the question: how come you feel the need to have a loaded gun by your side all the time?  Are you that fearful for your well-being?  If so, how come?I'm a single woman who lives alone in a large metropolitan area.  I don't own or carry a gun, and I don't feel the need to do so.  I guess I just don't afraid.  If someone wants to kill me or break into my home, they're going to do so whether or not I have a gun.  So what's the point of me having a gun?  Please, somebody convince me that it would be wise for me to have a gun."
2,You carry a licensed handgun in your car. You are on vacation   driving   across country. Your license should be good anywhere in the country. Even in the national park. Do you need it there? No. But why should you have to worry about remembering to unload it just because you are driving through the park.
1," If the 2nd amendment was to protect an individual right it would have clearly expressed it If the intentions of the framers had been to protect an individual right to bear arms, they would have clearly expressed this. Yet, the Second Amendment is not at all clear about an individual right to bear arms. The natural reading of the clause would indicate that the right relates only to the first, qualifying clause that states, ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State..."". It is a stretch to read into the language an individual right. If this was the case, why wouldn't they simply have explicitly stated that an ""individual right to bear arms should not be infringed"".

2,"If you stay in the city and are uncomfortable with   firearms   then by all means, don't buy one.  We're talking about people who want them for perfectly legitimate and necessary reasons of self defense, to have them in   national parks  .National parks are, in many places, wilderness.  Wilderness with   animals  , reptiles and sometimes people who threaten other people's personal safety.  We are afforded a right to self defense by any means through common and established   law  .  Removing one of the best and immediate ways of self defense by banning firearms in National Parks significantly impedes that right.  I am happy the government finally realized that.I always carry a firearm when I go into the woods, most often a handgun because it's smaller, lighter and easier with which to navigate through the bush.  I always felt ignoring this law would be the best policy for myself, believing that facing a judge would be more preferable than facing a pack of feral dogs or some other wild animal that would do me harm.

Or ""Should the ban on lawful   firearms   in National Parks be repealed?""  Asking whether   guns   should be allowed in National Parks puts the burden of proof on gunowners when it rightly belongs on those who wish to continue forcing us to disarm.  Criminals are going to ignore the policy and continue to do what criminals do.  Only law-abiding citizens try to obey this silly ban.  The ban is patently unconstitutional and is actually in conflict with federal law.  It's way past time for the ban to go away.  Guns are not banned in National Forests and there isn't a problem with people legally carrying guns causing problems on those lands so why is it assumed that people will be less responsible in National Parks?"

Narcotics are absolutely illegal to use without a doctor's prescription, everywhere, all the time. And what effect have laws against them had? None. So what makes you think that guns will be any different? The answer: ignorance. Actually, I don't even believe that is true. Deep down you know it's true, but you refuse to acknowledge it. Well, it's time to do so America.

2,"You make a good point, but I can't say I totally agree with it. I can see both sides of this argument. The problem I see is that addicts will still engage in illegal behavior to obtain their drugs. On the other hand, they're only that expensive because they're illegal. On the other hand, Portugal still made it illegal to sell, so the prices won't necessarily drop because there is still risk in selling them. I personally have never partaken in the use of illegal drugs, and I am against them because of what they do to people's lives, and more importantly, what they do to the lives of their families, especially   children  . But if you want to engage in self-destructive behavior and ruin your own life, that just makes more room for the rest of us. Of course, then we will end up paying to fix your screwed up life in the form of higher   taxes  .

The only people that say otherwise are the ignorant and the vested.. It truly is that simple given current circumstances..Addicts often commit   crime   because they are barred access to the job market. In America you virtually can't get a non wage slavery job without peeing in a cup. In a community where drug possession and therefor use is legal, drug testing should go down, and as it does the entry of functional addicts into the market will occur. Opening the door to a whole class of workers who spend their   money   on heroin instead of WoW and still show up to work on time.The drug market is a truly free market, and as such it reacts with lightning speed.""I am against them because of what they do to people's lives""Drugs themselves actually do very little harm, especially compared to things like HFCS, fat, or   cars  .

The   drug war   makes it impossible to get treatment, it forces addicts to live off grid, creating a self fulfilling prophecy. Of course addicts steal, once they are an addict we won't let them work!It creates a criminal enterprise that results in the utter destruction of communities. It's also hypocritical. We are a drug saturated   society  . The pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable one in America. This duplicity causes a fundamental distrust and hatred of the government who's cost alone cannot be calculated. And again, self fulling prophecy, when they in turn show a total lack of respect for authority we say the drugs did it, when in fact WE did it.Heroin used to be sold over the counter, some estimates place functional addiction in America almost to the one third mark at it's peak. Society's chief problem at the time? The stock market. Not street crime, not an army of addicted zombies living off government and outs, but upper class suits making margin calls and leading us into a depression on completely false claims.All the other drugs are a function of the drug war as well to one degree or another, as dealers sought to increase their profit per pound/gram/ton and set about refining their drugs. Meth as a street drug is a synthetic substitute for coca plain and simple. It exists almost solely because it can be produced in street labs.""they will be responsible for treating you as a result of your inability to control your own life.

By every objective relative measure the funding spent by the United States on aid to it's own citizens is abysmally small. If one were to judge our compassion based on those figures one would conclude we are a society with the moral fortitude of Ted Bundy.It is a classic example of swallow an elephant choke on a gnat. The drug war directly costs nearly 2000$ per second. A typical   food   stamp card costs 134$ a month. The myth of the nanny state is smoke and mirrors. The typical upper class American could not survive without the state regulating their business competition out of existence, and subsidizing their failures. (AIG anyone?) And on a purely practical note no policy change is painless. The art of state craft is the trade of 2 units of pain for 1 unit of pain.Given the untold billions in direct and indirect savings coupled with the increased productivity unquestionably associated with the termination of the drug war, the problems you describe even if they themselves were taken completely without argument would be a paltry annoyance compared to the utter human catastrophe drug policy is in America today.Indeed I believe the gains would be so excessive that they would in turn pay for any sort of short comings.But really do NOT trust me, go look into it. There are mountains of studies on each subject.I hope this was food for thought :)"

I don't think you'd find very many reputable sources that would say that.""Heroin used to be sold over the counter, some estimates place functional addiction in America almost to the one third mark at it's peak. Society's chief problem at the time? The stock market."" What time was this, and what evidence supports it? I mean, one third seems like an awfully high number. Alcohol is perfectly   legal   now, and so are   cigarettes  . But combined the percent of people addicted to these two substances doesn't equal 1/3. I couldn't find   alcohol   addiction alone, but best estimates for cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol combined is about 73 million people in the U.S., or about 20%. And ""  society  's chief problem"" is a subjective statement, and therefore pretty difficult to quantify.""The number of homeless people who are mentally ill is staggering.""Again, a subjective statement, but only about 1% of Americans are homeless for an extended period of time, with about 40-45% of those being considered mentally ill. While that number is sad, I'd be hard pressed to call it staggering. ""This image of the nanny state is largely a myth perpetrated by the right in order to preserve their own ill gotten gains.""Again, can you quantify this statement? And I'm a conservative. How exactly are my gains ""ill gotten."" I have worked my tail off just to reach middle class, and I have done it without infringing on the rights or walking on anyone to get where I am. And I have lived well below the poverty line, and it was nobody's fault but mine. And don't forget that there are plenty of people on the left who are obscenely wealthy. Are their gains ill gotten? That statement reeks of elitism and is a disgusting generalization, in my opinion.""The typical upper class American could not survive without the state regulating their business competition out of existence, and subsidizing their failures. (AIG anyone?)""While I am certainly not a part of the group to which you point in this statement, I think you are vilifying unjustly an entire group of people. If you had used a racial segment of the population, this would be called   racism  . Depending on what you call ""upper class"" I don't think that statement would hold water either. And I won't even begin to debate what the cause of the financial market collapse was, so don't waste your time trying to bait me into that one. ;-)Oh, and I forgot this one: ""Opening the door to a whole class of workers who spend their   money   on heroin instead of WoW and still show up to work on time.""Seriously? Really? You honestly think that a heroin addict would show up to work on time? Really? I mean that statement damn near leaves me speechless. If anything I said was questionable, that statement is outright pot-of-gold-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow fantasy. I seriously hope you didn't type that with a straight face. Again, I'm still on the fence, and that was   food   for thought, but much of what you said is subjective at best, and pure opinion at worst. Like I said before, if you want to destroy your life, go right ahead. Just don't drag me, or any other innocent person down with you. "

2,"The topic that should have been addressed here was Should Guns be Allowed in National Parks!  From the comments I read posted for most of the past week, the discussion has gotten way off the topic, and into a whole different thread for debate.As for the concept of   guns   being carried in National Parks, it should be a non-issue.  For starters if you take the 2nd amendment approach, what part of ""the rights of the people shall not be infringed"" do you fail to understand. Next, States are the authority that regulate the rules for Concealed Carry permit holders, and should apply to all areas not specifically prohibited by each state.  If a National Park is in a state that allows concealed carry then it should include the parks as well.  Aside from the obvious, concealed carry is   legal   in a growing number of states, so for those ""afraid"" of coming into contact with or being exposed to a gun, you already are on a daily basis in about 40 + states the last time I checked. I personally carry during majority of my waking hours, both in my own home and in public, with the exception of when at work or   church  . In my county, in Michigan, the last statistic I heard was the average for LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS with permits to carry concealed is about one in twelve.  I follow the rules, but I also challenge bad laws and rules when they are clearly violating my rights, my safety,  and conflict with the Constitution Of the United States of America!  I still happen to think that is the way our country should conduct it's affairs.  Remember, it's only been about the last 60-100 years that people have given up open carrying in most places, and many states including mine, still LEGALLY allow it.   I will still carry a gun either openly or concealed depending on the circumstances and location, if for no other reason than I still can, and in my opinion a right not exercised is a right lost by default!  The narrow minded individuals who wish to restrict or take away my rights, will have to do so when they pry the guns ""From my cold dead hands!"", even if that has become less socially acceptable and not politically correct."

2,"Thanks for the observation, and comment.  This is somewhat off the topic of National Park carry, but related to carrying for self-defense in general.   Actually since I wrote ""Please stay on topic!"" back in June, I have talked to the pastor of the   church   I attend, and got permission from the church board to carry while in services. I felt the worst that could happen was they would say no, in which case I would continue to keep things as it was. They were initially suprised because I asked, but were very supportive of the idea after we talked about my reasoning and intent.  They were glad to have someone step up and ask, who would be willing to protect those, who would not, or could not defend themselves.  I do not encourage violence, and I do not look for trouble, but I am cautious and prepared to deal with problems if they occur.  They understood my concern that over the increased attacks on people in ""gun free zones"" AKA: Victim Preserves in the last couple years.  I even took a couple of gentlemen to the   shooting   range to assure them that I am proficient with my sidearm, and to encourage them to consider having other regular members to carry in church.  As I explained to them, I carry almost all the time, because you never know when you might need to protect yourself and others.  It's kind of like having a spare tire and insurance for your car, you hope you never need to use it, but your sure glad to have it when it's needed.   After years in the field working with unstable violent juveniles, I am conditioned to act, and not freeze like many people do.I work in a Juvenile detention center, so for obvious reasons I would not even consider carrying at work.  I do however keep my self-defense firearm locked in a small pistol safe mounted in my trunk now, for the trip to and from, as we have had periodic threats toward the facility and staff by former residents and some of their gang-banger buddies.  I believe that has actually helped me better prepare to face challenges and act in a crisis situation. "

2,"I do truly wish that was possible!  Unfortunately I am surrounded by brain dead hoplophobes at work.  Of the 60-70 staff in the facility, and about 20 of whom actually have contact with the youths, there are only about 5 of us willing to acknowledge that we even carry for self defense.  So far as I know, I am the only one who willingly challenges the company policy about no weapons on the property, and that is essentially based on the assumption that the contents of my vehicle are my private property, and exempt from company control.  Yes, we have locked boxes in our secure entry area, but I have been personally told by our administrator those may only be used by LEO's in case of emergency, since even they are prohibited from weapons anywhere in the building.  I actually challenged the company policy on the basis that if they prevented the staff from protecting themselves, they should provide security in our parking lot.  This has gone unanswered, and no change in the policy has occurred in the past ten years. I am not in a position where I can financially afford to take the matter to court to change this company policy, or I would have by now. I am hoping Michigan, will pass a parking lot   law   such as have been brought up in other states.  Until then I'll operate on the basis of ""better to be tried by twelve, than carried by six""."
2,"UrsrMajor: Thank you for your explanation of the arms lockers at yourplace of employment. A few years ago I wrote to NRA and proposed a pos-sible answer to the problem faced by   law   and company rules-abiding em-ployees who need to keep arms in their private vehicles when at work be-cause they hunt or proficiency-shoot before or after work and [due todistance] cannot 'double back' to drop or pick up their arms at home...Understadably, most managements have a 'no weapons on company property'rule as they fear a disturbed employee may report to work and shoot theother people there. My idea was to offer employees an 'agreement' inwhich they wud:1. Apply for and agree with the rules regarding arms-in-parking lot.2. Never remove a locked-up arm from their vehicle, carry it into any      building onsite, or 'show it to others' [prospective buyers, etc.]3. Park in a reserved part of the lot that is lit up and watched by se-      curity CCTV cameras [to protect the vehicles from break-in as       well as any sign of agreement-violation. The employee shud al-      ways park there [closer to bldgs?] whether they happen to have      their arms aboard--or not. No one need know and it shudn't be an      issue...4. Any violation of the agreement wud result it loss of the agreement      up to termination...I hoped that such an agreement wud satisfy the arm-owning employees and nervous management. Also, I felt [and still believe] that this lotrule wud be something all cud accept. Want to go   hunting  ,   shooting  , orto show an arm to a fellow employee who is interested in buying it?

2,"This statement has no basis in fact.

In fact, the opposite is almost always the case.In addition,   legal   carry permit holders have a crime rate that is far below that of the general population.Base your decisions on fact rather than fear and prejudice.

2,"Why is it so hard to understand that criminals couldn't care less more   gun laws  ? The ones we have now don't work effectively, so why   add   more ineffective laws to the list?

I can't carry a gun or I might get into trouble!'OF course not.The only people who actually abide by the laws are the orderly people who want to protect themselves and their families.I have held a concealed carry permit for 20 years. I have never once even considered perpetrating a   crime   with my concealed weapon.  "
2,"Why do you think that is?So they can keep piling up more unconstitutional laws.Added to that deception is their cynical naming strategy.They put words like ""freedom,"" ""safety"" and ""hunter"" in their names, because they assume we're all idiots who will be fooled and vote for gungrabbers like Obama, hence their ""need"" to control us and strip our rights."
2,"One reason for the lack of enforcement is that there are too many laws now to enforce.  For instance, how many people are aware that a misdemeanor committed thirty or more years ago makes it a felony for the rest of your life, punishable by a mandatory five years in prison, to own so much as a single cartridge of ammunition?  That's only one example of how the 20,000+   gun laws   in this nation can make unknowing criminals of a large segment of our population.  If every current   gun law   was enforced, if every violator was charged, our courts would be backlogged for years, and there would not be enough jails and prisons in the entire country to hold those convicted."
2,"And why let our government be run by the same trial lawyers who put the same dangerous criminals back onto the streets?The same ones who put Obama into office, by the way.It's a familiar argument and a convenient excuse, ""we have so many laws we can't enforce them, so let's just pass a federal ban on them all.""Tyranny is always simple."

"
2,"The argument that we have problems because we don't enforce the existing laws is a dangerous trap.  The NRA position seems to be ""some   guns   are dangerous, but others are not, we should ban the dangerous ones and strictly enforce those bans, but keep sporting   firearms     legal  .""  This is wrong for two reasons.  The first is that all guns are dangerous.  It is not difficult to ruin someone's day with a .22.  This rhetoric leads to a flippant attitude around deadly weapons.  The second reason is that some guns are REALLY dangerous, and that's exactly why we need them.  (Surprised you, didn't I?)  The Founding Fathers didn't consider sport shooting and hunting to be of such value that it required a Constitutional Amendment.  They felt no need to similarly protect other passtimes.  That Amendment was passed because they realized that without arms the people would have no means by which to overthrow the government, and no means to force them to follow the rest of the Constitution.  It's not about safety, or hunting, or sport.  It's about protecting the right of the people to armed insurrection against a tyrranical government.  As such, the ""...Right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""  That means that our RIGHT to keep AND bear (not just lock unloaded in a safe with trigger guard, but actually carry around with us) ARMS (not just certain guns that the government decides are safe for us to have, but all arms, from a Saturday Night Special to   military  -grade C4) shall not be infringed (limited in any way).  Therefore, the NRA's argument that we ""need to enforce the laws on the books,"" is rubbish.  There should be no laws on the books."
2,"One thing that really peeved me this last   election   is the hunters out there.1. There is no constitutional right to hunt. It's about the right to bear arms in sufficient quantity and firepower that a mass of the people who need to resist tyranny can do so.2. The hunters overwhelmingly voted for Obama because they bought his line about being pro-Second Amendment. They were either ignorant or weren't paying attention, because his hostility to the Constitution is plain to see.The idiocy of this is apparent. ""Well, Obama's not going to come after my long gun, and I've got mine and I'm all I care about.""There is no country on this earth that banned and confiscated handguns that didn't also ban and confiscate rifles. Hunting came right after, as we're seeing in the UK now."
2,"I'm sick and tired of seeing the Republican party painted as radical right-wingers on the mainstream   media  , and as protectors of liberty on Fox News.  What a joke!  The Republicans are just as socialist as the Dems, but paint themselves as defenders of the Constitution and promoters of ""limited government"" (as if such a thing were possible).  The Democrats make the whole thing worse by painting them as radicals, when they are anything but.  Hopefully President Obama screws up quick enough that the people haven't forgotten the miserable failures of Bush, and just decide to get rid of them all.  They keep painting this picture of Red vs. Blue, when really they're just two sides of the same statist coin.  The real conflict in this country is between Statist and Libertarian, but the major political parties obfuscate this point to get away with blatant Statism that would never get by the people honestly.  Hopefully Ol' Barry goes too far and shocks some sense into people.  Historically, high   food   prices has been enough to do the trick, and that's coming quick."
2,The NRA does not advocate any   firearms   bans. They advocate safe and responsible ownership of all types of arms and   education   and training to utilize them safely and effectively.And I disagree that there should be no laws on the books.

2,"You said:""And I disagree that there should be no laws on the books. There should be laws about the ILLEGAL use of   firearms   and consequences for those uses. And those laws should be strictly enforced.""But when you look at the actual crimes: assault,   murder  , etc. you see that there are already laws punishing such acts.  Is killing someone with a gun somehow worse than killing them with a rock?  If you ask me, the thought of killing someone by bludgeoning them to a wet and messy death seems far more nefarious and evil than bending a finger at 17 yds. Yet the finger-bending has attached to it a far stiffer sentence.  Yet the opposition calls these laws ""common-sense"".  And we buy into it? Really?""But, what about acquisition laws for felons or the mentally unstable?"" you might ask.I am on the fence here.  I suppose that a person who has been convicted of killing someone else, if they failed rehabilitation, should be barred from gun ownership.  But what about the rehabilitated felon?  Do they deserve to lose constitutionally protected rights?  "
2,"...but there still needs to be laws for illegal activities connected with   guns  . This allows you to bring more charges against an offender and keep them in jail longer.

2,"While I agree that the Brady Campaign is anti-  constitution  , at least when it comes to the 2nd Amendment, I think it's a stretch to call them anti-American. I am a   legal   carry permit holder, so I staunchly defend my 2nd Amendment right to bear arms and defend myself anywhere and everywhere. However, one of this country's greatest traits is the right to disagree with the government openly with no consequence (as long as you keep it peaceful, of course). I will therefore counter their rhetoric with facts all day long, but I wouldn't call them unAmerican no matter how loony they get."

Our empathetic judges can see words that don't appear on paper when it comes to privacy issues that don't exist in the words of the constitution, but can ignore the plain language of the 2nd amendment.

There is absolutely no reason or evidence to expect   law  -abiding gun-carrying people to suddenly become crazed killers or poachers simply because they cross an invisible, imaginary boundary line.  On the other hand, there is every reason to believe that   the law  -breaking people who currently carry illegally off of park lands will give a bit more thought before committing crimes on park lands now that potential victims have the potential of fighting back. If the National Park Rangers truly believe that self defense is not an issue in national parks, why is every Ranger I've met armed?  I know the answer to that and so do the people from Freedom States Alliance.  The only Rangers who opposed the Coburn Amendment were the politically appointed management wonks in Washington, DC.   Two national parks are within an hour's drive from my front door.  I regularly come into contact with Park Service rangers and speak with them on a personal, unofficial basis.

We are factory workers,   doctors  , farmers, lawyers, nurses, store clerks and house wifes. You have been next to us in super markets, malls, banks and on the street.We are trained, licensed   law   abiding citizens that carry a firearm for personal protection. Are we suddenly going to go crazy just because we are in a National Park and start killing people? The only ones who have to fear us are rapists, robbers, and other assorted criminals that wish to harm us.Quit worrying about us the next time you go to a park, and have a great time! "
2,"Let me take this point by point:[b]“Congress passed dangerous legislation…”[/b]Where is the proof that this is dangerous legislation? There are millions of legally armed citizens in this country. If you are not in one of the few states that refuses to issue carry permits to   law  -abiding citizens, then you have been in line at the grocery store behind someone carrying a firearm legally. You have bumped into them while walking down the street. You have sat next to them at a red light during your commute, or while on vacation. Do they pull out their   guns   and fire shots in the air while screaming, “Yeeeeee haaaaaaaw”? No. Why? Because those who choose to legally arm themselves (i.e. carry permit holders) are among the most law-abiding citizens in our nation. The   crime   rate among permit holders is a fraction of the crime rate among the rest of the population. This is a fact, and it is undisputed by the Brady Campaign.[b]“These members weakened   public safety   and stripped Americans of their right to enjoy   national parks   and wilderness areas free from the threat of armed citizens...”[/b]This is nothing but fear-mongering and paranoia. Again, people in this country arm themselves on a daily basis all around you, and it is no way affecting your safety. This idea that   legal   carry permit holders walk around with an itchy trigger finger just waiting to blast a hole in the first thing that moves is not only stupid, but in complete contradiction of facts and history. The thing that the anti-gun agenda leaves out of every one of the satements like the one above is that there is a distinct difference between LEGAL carriers of   firearms   and those that do so ILLEGALLY. Banning the legal carry of firearms in our National and State Parks would change nothing. And that’s the problem. There are already people who carry in our parks. The problem is that they are doing so illegally. Allowing those who carry legally to do so in our parks will deter crime, not encourage it. [b]“Our country was founded on the principal that we are a nation of laws and yet the gun lobby is seemingly advocating anarchy over our own government when it comes to the gun issue.”[/b]I hereby challenge Ms. Slovenski to produce one notable instance where the NRA, Gun Owner of America, or another major pro-gun lobby has advocated anarchy. All we ask is that you treat the 2nd Ammendment with the same respect as the 1st, or the 4th, or the 5th. You don’t want those others trampled on, so why choose the 2nd?[b]“It is absolutely astonishing that while Americans are swamped in   credit card   debt and now have better protections for their economic security, our very own personal safety is at greater risk traveling to our national parks,” [/b]See above. There is still no basis in fact. People carry legally every day, with very few instances that warrant concern. You have much more to worry about from gang members and other thugs who will carry everywhere regardless of how many laws and statutes are enacted. You’re not preventing crime by limiting access to guns by law-abiding citizens. [b]“Despite concerns raised by park rangers, Congress put the safety of national park visitors and wildlife at risk by allowing concealed, loaded firearms at 388 of 391 national park sites. Coburn’s amendment overturned a Reagan-era regulation that allowed unloaded and safely stowed firearms in national parks.”[/b]There’s really not much of a difference here. Guns today are much safer than guns during Reagan’s administration. My personal carry gun has no less than 4 external safety mechanisms that ensure, even when loaded and a round is chambered, that you do not fire a round unaware, or by accident. And that doesn't include internal safety mechanisms.  [b]“Gun proponents continue to say that prohibitions against carrying guns in national parks violates their Second Amendment rights. But even Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority in the Heller case that stripped D.C. of its handgun ban, stated conclusively: ‘Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings.’”[/b]I don’t see how a National Park can be included in the definition of “sensitive places.” National Parks are frequented by the same people who are in your neighborhood, that walk next to you on our streets. Why should there be any more restrictions in parks than in those other places. There is ample evidence to show that   gun control   has the effect of encouraging and emboldening criminals. Study after study continues to show this. And study after study continues to be ignored by anti-gun lobbyists. When they produce facts to the contrary, I may be encouraged to reconsider my position."

Indeed guns may actually save lives in some instances, although I have never seen any data to indicate this effect is even the same order of magnitude as its dominant effect.Please look at the relationship between Switzerland and the USA.There does appear to be a more carefully balanced policy that can lead to all the positives and not so many negatives of gun ownership.In answer to your specific points:Out of date; The studies span 5 years, with the newest only 4 years ago.

I would further encourage you to read the whole thing. So much of the gun-control lobby's position is filled with fluff and outright B.S. that it's actually insulting that we even have to have this discussion. And remember, very few countries have a drug problem that mirrors that in the U.S. And as a result, the majority of gun   crime   in this country is gang related. So should I lose my right to own and carry a gun because some other jackass can't get a real job? In the same way I shouldn't be robbed of the privilege (not right) of driving a car because some idiots can't seem to get slobbery drunk and not drive their   cars  , that argument makes no sense."

2,"In response to Marloma - a gun wouldn't necessarily have made a difference, but it *could* have made a difference, and an individual has the right to choose whether he/she has the means to defend themselves and make a difference where their personal safety is concerned.  Yes, the women survived, but at what cost?   Would you choose to be raped for 14 hours straight or would you choose to arm yourself and increase your odds of not being raped?  Why do you say ""More than likely they would have been less safe""?  Every day, ordinary Americans defend themselves from criminal attack through the display or use of a firearm.  It's a fact that if a criminal knows his prey is armed, he moves on and looks for easier prey.  It's another fact that if you ban guns, only the criminals will have guns.   And another thought in closing - when seconds count, the police are only minutes away.   Wake up, buy a gun and take responsibility for your own personal safety."

But why isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to assume that since the framers knew that the way militias were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing a law against militias, but by taking away the people's weapons -- that was the way militias were destroyed. The two clauses go together beautifully: Since we need a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""

I'm confused. Isn't that the major reason   gun rights   advocates are for handguns? It's sure the reason I carry one. And I like how you assert that it's bad to have handguns, but an Uzi is OK. That's rational. "
1,Get your facts straight - gang related handgun   deaths   accounted for less than 20%. Crimes of passion and against acquaintances accounted for more than 60%.The defense comment was sarcasm .... Of course hand   guns   can be removed from the population as they were in the UK through buy-back and other aggressive programs. Its the will to fix the problem that is needed. It is absurd to suggest that all citizens should pack guns to make things safe. You still haven't provided a good reason for handguns - or Uzi's (part of the sarcasm). A rifle or shotgun is respectable. The rest are stupid.
2,"So it's OK to defend my home with a rifle or a shotgun, but not a handgun? So my 30.06 rifle, which when fired at an intruder would likely go through him, a couple of walls and possibly one of my   children   is a more sensible choice for personal defense than a .40 caliber handgun with jacketed hollow points that are designed not to go through a person? Not to mention the fact that rifles and shotguns require two hands to shoot and I might need one of those hands or may sustain an injury to one of my hands. So how exactly is a rifle or shotgun a better choice again? How does it make more sense?The fact is you are basing your opinion on possibly fear and definitely ignorance of handguns and the tactics involved with their use. They are without a doubt the best defense against a violent attacker for the very same reason they are the number one choice of them. They are small, easy to operate, lightweight, and can fire several rounds in succession with the need to cycle the action to load another round. If you fire at a criminal and miss with a shotgun or rifle and have to load another round, chances are he is going to have that weapon and use it against you in no time. On the other hand, with my gun, I have 17 chances to hit that bastard before he has a chance to get my gun. And it only takes me about 1.5 seconds to load another 16 round magazine and try again - about the same amount of time it takes to chamber another round in a shotgun or bolt action rifle.And to respond to the title of your last thread: ""But who wants to live in Kennesaw?"" If you mean the actual town, maybe you have a point, maybe you don't. I'm sure the folks there would say the same thing about Bombay. But if you mean in a place that has a   crime   rate so low and hasn't seen a   homicide   since 1989, I think you'd find plenty that would love to live in a place like that. So what's your problem with it? Don't like living in a safe community?"

2,"""...anyone who reads it knows that it means the right to keep and bear arms belongs to those who have served in militia...""Assuming that you are a citizen of the U.S., then you, personally, have served and are serving in the militia: as have everyone else.  The militia is composed of all citizens, who can be called forth in defense of the country, region or area not just for military service, but police actions also.  In addition, the militia can be called to aid in natural and/or man made disasters.In essence, the militia is the willing cooperation of free men and women who consciously choose to support and defend the society and government they have created."
1,"Errr.... they must do so in an organized manner to be a militia.  (Just... one... teeny tiny distinction.)All members of the Rotary Club are citizens.I am a citizen.Therefore, I am a member of the Rotary Club.Okay, I don't actually know if that's a stipulation to being in the R.C., but you can see how that doesn't work.  That all members of a militia are citizens doesn't mean that all citizens are members of the militia.  But I have since examined this issue in my mind for laborious hours and have come to think that this only says the protection against federal imposition upon the arms of the militia shall not be infringed.  It doesn't say that if you aren't in the militia you can't keep and bear arms... but it doesn't say that it is a right that can't be infringed, or controlled.  "
2,"Let's examine this from an historical point of view, rather than as an artificial construction.  From U.S. vs. Miller 1939:""...The Militia which the States were expected to maintain and train is set in contrast with Troops which they were forbidden to keep without the consent of Congress. The sentiment of the time strongly disfavored standing armies; the common view was that adequate defense of country and laws could be secured through the Militia- civilians primarily, soldiers on occasion.The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time...""From the National Guard Charter:""In addition to the definitions in sections 1-5 of title 1, the    following definitions apply in this title:        (1) ""Territory"" means any Territory organized after this title      is enacted, so long as it remains a Territory. However, for      purposes of this title and other laws relating to the militia,      the National Guard, the Army National Guard of the United States,      and the Air National Guard of the United States, ""Territory""      includes Guam and the Virgin Islands.        (2) ""Armed forces"" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine      Corps, and Coast Guard.        (3) ""National Guard"" means the Army National Guard and the Air      National Guard.        (4) ""Army National Guard"" means that part of the organized      militia of the several States and Territories, Puerto Rico, and      the District of Columbia, active and inactive, that -           (A) is a land force;          (B) is trained, and has its officers appointed, under the        sixteenth clause of section 8, article I, of the Constitution;          (C) is organized, armed, and equipped wholly or partly at        Federal expense; and          (D) is federally recognized...""This last means that the Militia are not the National Guard, but that the National Guard will train and equip the members of the militia.  This law changes where the militia acquire military equipment but does not negate both the duty and right to keep and maintain arms ""...of the kind in common use at the time...""I don't know if you are familiar with the case or not, but the Supreme Court recently delved in depth with these very subjects: the militia and the individual right to keep and bear arms.  The location is:  http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-2901.pdf  The reasoning is quite good. Also, this decision left open the government's power to regulate the right, but not negate it."

1,"The US Constitution is so frequently called upon for support for free gun ownership and yet it appears those who use it to defend their arguments seem to have forgotten to read it. The protection afforded by the Constitution is not for personal unsupervised ownership of   guns   , but the right to formation and governance of militia (National Guard, Army, ...). Specifically:""To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the   discipline   prescribed by Congress;The logical extreme of this so-called right? Personal   nuclear     firearms   ? Mandatory gun ownership? School   children   required to wear holsters as part of their school uniforms? Some of this is already happening ... Because of guns, America is the least safe country in the world. If nothing else, handguns should be eliminated. I challenge anyone to explain why handguns (concealed guns) are needed - except for   law   enforcement or for personal use to defend against other handguns. If handguns were banned, then only criminals would have them for a while, making it easy to pick out the ones the   police   should shoot. Home owners could still have a personal Uzi at home. Still, far fewer people would die given the majority of   deaths   are passion-related - killed by someone you know and/or love.I have lived in 2 countries where guns were banned and can attest to the safety and calm it affords the citizens not to have to worry about being held up at gunpoint, shot by a road-rager, killed by an angry spouse.   Americans   deserve a hand-gun free country."
2,"Please explain how having the tools, skills, and will to stop this incident before it ever became a horrible ordeal could have possibly made it worse?When I lived in that great gun-ban paradise Chicago, I was raped.  Not only did the police fail to act on my prior reports of stalking and harassment, but thanks to the rapist's shall-we-say connections he was never arrested or prosecuted.I now live in a state where I can own and carry a gun for personal defense.  My training includes gun handling and safety control under stress, combat marksmanship, the judicious use of deadly force, weapon retention, and force-on-force (actual combat using non-lethal Simuntion marking cartridges or Airsoft guns).  How does this preparation render me less safe than being helpless?"
2,"From your perspective I can only imagine how much safer you feel. I too carry a handgun for personal defense, in addition I have a CCL which permits me to carry a concealed gun in public (there are exceptions to this which vary from state to state). I live in a rough town, not to mention I teach at a high school which is prone to violence, and I just wish they'd let the teachers carry handguns for protection as well. "

Further, if no gun law is unreasonable, pretty soon no guns, a total ban by any other name is still a total ban, will be achieved, to your delight and my families nightmare and, most likely, soon to be death.

2,"The Court limited Miller to the proposition that “the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.”  Miller doesn't mention ""law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.""  It says weapons ""not typically possesed or use by militia"".  In other words, if there was testimony that sawed off shotguns were used by the military, (which they are)then they would be covered by the Second Ammendment.The reason that there was no testimony in this regard is that there was no testimony from the defence at all.  Only the government attended the trial.  No one from the other side was there!"
2,"The dissenting jurists based their opinions on a vast ignorance of, or worse yet, ignoring of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I was educated in the public and private school system in the 1950s and 1960s. I was taught the Second Amendment was meant to overthrow tyrants, if it ever came to that. The petulant whining of Nancy Pelosi et al, only serves to display their true agenda. To rule. It's not about guns, it's about control. I have never seen a bigger bunch of freedom-hating clowns in one place than we have in Washington today. They are a bigger threat to freedom than al qaeda and the taliban combined.  Why are murders with guns always highest in places with the strictest gun control? The brady bunch always has to lie to get their message out. They know the light of truth ALWAYS cancels out their lies. Here is what some of the men who wrote our Founding Documents had to say about guns. James Madison wrote, ""Americans have the right and advantage of being armed; unlike the citizens of other countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with arms."" (The Federalist, No. 46 at 243- 244)Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""No Free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms."" (Thomas Jefferson, Proposal to Virginia Constitution, 1 T. Jefferson Papers, 334, [C.J. Boyd, Ed., 1950] )George Washington wrote, ""A free people ought ... to be armed ...."" (George Washington, speech of Jan. 7, 1790, in the Boston Independent Chronicle, Jan. 14, 1790)Samuel Adams wrote, ""The Constitution shall never be construed ... to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms."" (Samuel Adams, Debates and Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87)Finally, Thomas Paine wrote, ""Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property ... Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them."" (Thomas Paine, Thoughts On Defensive War, 1775)These dissenting jurors obviously have an anti-freedom agenda and the only thing that stands between the wannabe tyrants and their goal is ""WE THE PEOPLE"", you know, the ones mentioned throughout those sacred documents. In 1967, I took an oath to 'protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and DOMESTIC' and I intend to honor that sacred oath. "
2,"Please, Please show me where in the 2nd amendment to the United States Constitution it has any limitations on the bearing of arms....Personally I feel that everybody should enjoy the freedom to protect themselves, be they felons or even mentally ill people, and the way I feel about it is backed up by the Constitution, as it says we have the freedom to pursue ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" Prohibiting people from owning guns just takes the RKBA from law abiding citizens it does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of those who will use them for evil purposes.If it is felt that a person is too dangerous to own a firearm then that person should not be free in our society he should either be commitment for a mental illness that keeps him from functioning as a member of society or he should be in prison as he is too violent to be among the citizens that are allowed all their freedoms as enumerated in the constitution."
2,"Until then...You state: ""The Court also concludes that the Second Amendment is consistent with laws banning “dangerous and unusual weapons” not “in common use at the time,” such as M-16 rifles and other   firearms   that are most useful in   military   service.""Your attempt to spin the opinion has failed here.  It is common knowledge that the 2nd Amendment was specifically designed to include militaristic rifles, for the express purpose of ensuring the ability of the citizenry of throwing the shackles of oppressive Government.  This was the case when the federal government ratified the amendment and also when each state wrote their own constitutions, insofar as similar rights were included.  In claiming that the 2nd Amendment pertains to hunting, the shooting   sports  , and collecting, the anti-gun lobby misframes the entire concept of the amendment and thought-process of the framers when it was ratified."
2,"It is my belief that by removing the citizens ability to protect themselves, the Mayor and Councilmen of Washington D.C. increased the instances of violent crime and even non-violent crime as the criminals in that city no longer had anything to fear when they were going about their day to day activity's ! If you take an objective look at the crime rates for city and state's that have restrictive gun laws  vs. those having non-restrictive gun laws you will see for yourself that there is a large difference in the numbers and they don't show positively on gun control of any kind."
1,"Handguns would be of little use to a militia fighting the US military. The notion involved in the ""militia"" clause of the 2nd amendment is that it is important for citizens to have the right to form a militia in order to combat a tyrannical government, and presumably its army. In the modern day, this would require that a militia be capable of mustering powerful firearms, including tanks and bazookas, such that they could combat the modern power of the US military. Based on this interpretation, what use would handguns be to a militia, whose inherent purpose is to combat or check the most powerful military the world has ever seen? The handgun would provide negligible use to such a militia, and so has little value in upholding any right the 2nd amendment offers to individuals to form a militia. This makes the banning of handguns in Washington, DC of little consequence to the integrity of the 2nd amendment's militia clause. 
"
2,"If the ban was so effective then Washington DC would have lead the nation as one of the safest cities, not one of the most dangerous.you had to pander to suicide to try to find some statistic that in some way could paint DC as not one of the most violent places in the country.Population density and poverty create violence- not the availability of guns. Attacks on guns are heart string issues that waste funds and pander to voters during election cycles. If you cared about the constituency of the people you served, you would stop stripping them of rights and treating them as incompetent, and empower them. Allow them their rights, show that they can be something, and put the piles of money into something productive."
2,"It's always an amusement for me when I consider the specious nature of those who tout ""gun control.""  With the simple fact that gun laws ONLY affect the law abiding, you might think that what's really required is a sure and severe punishment for those that break the law whether it be by misuse of a hand gun or a Ping Eye 7 iron.The anthropomorphizing of an inanimate object when it comes to assignation of blame is a specious argument and a vacuous concept.  The problem with the pro gun-control lobby is that they are focused on the symptom and not the disease.  Guns are neither good nor bad, those attributes are properly reserved for people.  Knowing that, we should enforce the laws against criminals and for gosh sake stop blaming the tools."
2," First off, let me say that I come from a family of Law Enforcement Officers. My father was on the LAPD for 7 years and then the BNE for another 30 years. I respect Law Enforcement and applaud the work that they do to keep us safer. Notice I said safer and not safe. It is not the duty of the police to protect individulas. The courts have already ruled on this. So if it is not the job of the police whose job is it? OURS! LEOs run across heavily armed felons and need to be better armed. I wholly agree! These same felons attack civilians in their homes - do not these civilains have the same right to protect themselves?"
2," You support the police getting higher powered weapons to defend themselves against felons, why should law abiding citizens have the same chance to defend themselves?"
2,"The Second Amendment is about prohibiting the Government from restricting the Citizens Rights.  Has nothing to do with type of guns.  The guns the Founders used were the most advanced types of their day and Citizens could and did, own all of them, up to and including cannon and warships."
2,"I'm fine with making it harder for people with criminal records to obtain a waepon, I actually think that's an okay idea; however, banning guns altogether is against the US Constitution.  The 2nd amendment states that all citizens have the right to bear arms and that this right shall never be infringed.  The fact that this debate is astonishing to me.Take the peaceful country of Switzerland for example; they boast one of the lowest crime rates in the world (if not the lowest) due to the fact that everyone is armed.  After serving a short term in the army (which I'm not recommending for the US), every man is given a weapon of their choice.  So it's kind of hard to rob a convenience store when the clerk has an AK-47 or a M-16 behind the counter, maybe even a rocket launcher if they want.Guns keep people safe, it's plain and simple.  Like the Swiss have found, it's hard to overpower someone when they're packing a .45 on their hip or purse.  You have the right to defend yourself and guns are one of the best ways to do that.Just remember: 2nd amendment.  Leave the guns alone."
2,"You obviously do not understand the cost of FREEDOM ,that which our fathers understood...Freedom is not free & does cost the citizens , sometimes foolishly but it does cost ...IT is the price of freedom that many a man has died for ...Whether it is in WAR or peace time, the price is the same...""The Tree of LIBERTY is watered by the blood of the PATRIOTS"",,, GET IT YET ??"
2,"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.“By calling attention to ‘a well regulated militia’, the ’security’ of the nation, and the right of each citizen ‘to keep and bear arms’, our founding fathers recognized the essentially civilian nature of our   economy  . Although it is extremely unlikely that the fears of governmental tyranny which gave rise to the Second Amendment will ever be a major danger to our nation, the Amendment still remains an important declaration of our basic civilian-military relationships, in which every citizen must be ready to participate in the defense of his country. For that reason, I believe the Second Amendment will always be important.” John F. Kennedy, April 1960“Today, we need a nation of Minutemen, citizens who are not only prepared to take arms, but citizens who regard the preservation of freedom as the basic purpose of their daily life and who are willing to consciously work and sacrifice for that freedom."" -- John F. Kennedy "
2,"In the past, on numerous occasions, I have heard the argument presented that we don’t need   firearms   to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government because our government, the federal government of the United States would never turn against us.I have heard it said that gun owners are paranoid to believe that our federal government would turn against us.Well, I have to say that now our so-called paranoia has been justified.I believe it is safe to say that the federal government has officially become the tyrannical government that we warned about.The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Intelligence and Analysis has put out a report, titled ""Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,"" which, I dare say, defines half of the country as radical extremists whose activity must be monitored to ensure the safety of the country.After all the condemnations from the socialist liberals on the left about government spying on citizens of the United States, these same socialists, now in power, are using that very power to spy on citizens of the United States. And we’re not talking about naturalized people, we’re talking about Americans born and raised here. We’re talking about people who have sacrificed in the military to defend our freedom.We now have the most liberal, socialist person ever in the White House. Congress is controlled by socialist liberals and they intend to make the most of it.If you support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights of the United States, including the 1st, 2nd and 10th Amendments; if you object to an ever growing out of control government; if you have conservative or libertarian beliefs on certain social issues, you may consider yourself to be a radical extremist."

1," 2nd amendment could not exist solely to uphold militias as Congress has power to disarm them Congress has the power and authority to disarm a militia. This is necessary to uphold the monopoly on military force in the state and to protect the integrity of the state. It also should be recognized that a militia could take a form that is entirely ""inappropriate"" and contrary to the interests of the vast majority of the citizenry. Such a militia might claim that the state is acting ""tyrannically"" because it is acting ""democratically"", instead of according to the prescript of God. 99% of citizens might oppose the existence of this militia. Is the Second Amendment meant to protect the existence of such a militia? No. Congress has the authority to disband it. Therefore, the right to form a militia is in question, making a ban on hanguns more appropriate, as it does not conflict with any supposed right to form a militia.  
"
1,"that in this situation the federal government still controls the army?If the army's on the side of the federal government, I'm sorry but no amount of firearm training will equip you to deal with a tank, a helicopter, a mortar shell. Game over.If the army ISN'T on the side of the federal government, then we've got very little to worry about because they'll take care of things. Like Turkey does every couple of decades.How exactly has the federal government turned against you? I mean that literally. The guy was elected with a majority--a massive majority--and that gives him an awful lot of political capital to spend. So how are the people not with him?Liberal and socialist are certainly political standpoints, and yeah, Obama and Pelosi are relatively left-leaning. This does NOT mean they're out to control the world, or are spying on you. Or you get to shoot them. You cannot shoot a person based on their political beliefs.Who, exactly, is spying on you?"
2,"The issue is that the army would likely split if we all went to extremes.  A serious civil war could occur but I don't believe this will happen.  (I would prefer a civil war to UHC however)Obama was indeed elected by a vast majority... a vast majority of easily convinced sheep people who went along with the trend for various reasons.  This   election   was easily the most intense and divisive I have ever lived through.  Many Americans voted for a socialist president (yes, I can rightly call Obama a socialist) against their true values.  Laziness or hatred of Bush or race caused a lot of people to vote against what they really wanted and valued in our country's leader.  That is why people are starting to go against him now, after following through with a few of his socialist promises (UHC).Personally, I wouldn't say the federal government turned on me. I would say America turned on me.  I am fighting to keep my rights and still people support socialism in America.  If anyone wants socialism, please feel free to move to a country that already has it in place.  Here, socialism is unconstitutional.  Yet I stand by and watch my freedoms disappear.As far as Obama and Pelosi not being out to control the world... why do people pursue   politics  ?  Oh, right. Power.Back to the topic of   guns  , every qualified citizen should own a gun and many should carry them.  This would do little to protect oneself against our overwhelmingly powerful government but it would do a lot to prevent criminals from trying to steal or   murder   or rape because they would be afraid of their own lives.I think the founding fathers would be disappointed with the state of America today.  Already people are eating out of the governments' hands. Literally."

2,"  I recently had an epiphany of sorts, thanks to a video I watched by Penn & Teller called Bull$#it! 309 Gun Control.  I have read the Second Amendment and I thought I understood the meaning of the Second Amendment. I have listened to people, so-called experts on both sides of the   gun control   argument, express their ideas as to the meaning of the Second Amendment.  Now, I’ve always understood that the need for and the purpose of the Second Amendment was for the PEOPLE to be able to rise up and defend themselves from a federal government becoming tyrannical and turning against the people.  Anti-gun people contend that the MILITIA referred to in the Second Amendment is a standing federal army or the National Guard and that the Second Amendment provides for same.  The MILITIA, in this case, is viewed by gun proponents the same as an armed populace that can be deployed along with a standing army (just as occurred during the recent Revolutionary War) in the event of attack from without.  However, I would suggest that the MILITIA refers to a standing army that the PEOPLE would have to defend against.  It is the comma after the phrase “A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State,” that is at the center of the dispute.  That comma has caused a lot of misunderstanding, in addition to the brief wording of the Second Amendment. Two hundred years later, we don’t understand the Second Amendment, in part because we have not recently fought a war of independence from an oppressive government.  Additionally, there is the fact that our use and understanding of certain words has changed during the last 200 years.  For example, consider the phrase, “well regulated.” We may think regulated means “controlled.” At the time the Second Amendment was written, regulated meant organized and/or properly trained.  Further, since that time, a well regulated militia of the people, organized and properly trained has not been maintained. On the other hand, the federal government has maintained a well regulated military.  Therefore, consider this interpretation of the Second Amendment:In order for the Unites States to be able to defend itself against foreign attack, a standing army is necessary that the people of the United States may remain a free people, a free state. However, because we are fearful that a central, Federal government, with command and control of said standing army, may, at some point in time become an oppressive government just as the one that we recently threw off, and may deploy said standing army against the civilian population, said civilian population, the PEOPLE, shall have the right to keep and bear arms and that right shall not be infringed by the Federal government.  I cannot ascertain the reason the founders chose to write the Second Amendment the way they did, however, I believe I now know exactly what they meant.  I suggest that you view Penn & Teller’s video and you will too.  While some people may say that it would be fruitless to go up against our modern military with the small arms available to us, an idea that I may address at a later date, the fact is, the Second Amendment was written for such a purpose at that time and is still in place today. I will say that I find it hard to believe that the founders would have imagined that our military would possess weapons that the people would not have access to, either by denial or impractical to possess.  The fact remains that the government, by   law  , cannot infringe upon our right to keep and bear arms. "
2,"I have heard the following argument on several occasions in the past and again yesterday as to why the Second Amendment as a guarantee that the people shall have the right to keep and bear arms is obsolete: “Armed with only rifles and pistols, how could you possibly prevail against the Army?”That question in and of itself should be a self-evident answer as to why the Second Amendment is in place and why it is important that we not allow it to be undermined.All throughout history there have been many military conflicts in which an outnumbered and out-gunned force was able to either hold their own for a significant time and/or prevail in the conflict.In many of these cases people fought a superior force that had invaded their homeland. People fought fiercely and in many cases prevailed. To do so they utilized every weapon they had available to them including improvised weapons such as Molotov Cocktails.They also had talented and dedicated people who were able to design and manufacture weapons under extremely trying circumstances.People who use this as an argument, I suspect, aren’t fully informed about a number of things including the fact that there more armed people in the United States than there are military personnel, the dedication of those armed people to protect and defend freedom and liberty, that the illegal use of the military against the civilian population would certainly be met with intense resistance, probably in the form of guerilla warfare, and the possibility that many members of the military may refuse to follow illegal orders to attack the civilian population.Further, people don’t realize that it wouldn’t take many armed citizens to overpower some elements of the military and take control of the more advanced weapons at hand.Consider the use of the Liberator pistol provided to the French resistance during WWII. These cheaply made, single shot pistols (I’m told that it took longer to reload one than to manufacture one) was used to eliminate a single enemy soldier and take his arms.Although I am unable to locate the source of this bit of info, I recall hearing that the Rhodesian military was ordered not to fire their weapons on full-auto in order to conserve ammo when faced with a vastly superior force that was constantly re-supplied by the Soviet Union. The Rhodesians were able to hold their own for some time in the face of a larger force.One must also consider how the Soviet Army was eventually defeated by the people of Afghanistan.However, I find the idea that a person could even consider the possibility that the United States government would use the military against the civilian population to be more than a little disturbing.Seriously, how could anyone suggest such a possibility? Are they suggesting that the United States federal government would deploy tanks and aircraft against us?No, I think it unlikely that the U.S. government would do that. Certainly the government is aware of two things: one that to mobilize the military against civilians is illegal and second they know what the response would be.  They do know this, don't they?Actually, I think a greater threat is the militarization of the local police but I will leave that for another discussion. "
1,"The Rhodesian, and the Soviets.All of their positions involved ground troops in prolonged conflict. Now, I don't care what   guns   you've bought, you and two hundred people are not going to storm a US army base and capture it. The army doesn't actually need to be there to kill you--they can shell you from a distance wherever you're holed up. If you want to compare your possible conflict to something, you'd be taking the side of the insurgents in Iraq--well armed, have the lay of the land, etc. Now, certainly Americans are killed by those insurgents. BUT they haven't taken one base, they haven't driven out any occupying forces. If it was policy to hunt down insurgent cells as the primary goal, with the entire armed forces brought to bear (as it certainly would be in a civil war) there would be little doubt who the victor would be."
2,"In Iraq and Afghanistan every time a US soldier gets killed some civilians join to take his spot. So the army is refueled by the people behind it. In the case that an army is turned on its own people you have the issue of where the new soldiers come from. You could conscript them from the cities you capture, but whats to stop them and their CO's from joining the rebels after you supply them with weapons and armor? And say your tank gets blown up, where are they going to remake it? Artillery is a problem, but will Johny boy shoot at his own home?While the government may try to repress a few rebellious cities with the army, they could not ever win a full blown war with the population.

"
1," In today's reality the Second Amendment cannot be applied to civilians The difference in the technology the military now employs versus the personal guns individual civilians can have access to is  exponentially greater than in the framer's time. This means that in today's reality the Second Amendment cannot apply to civilians with the purpose of preparing them to be part of the militia at any day or time.The huge technological advances and military training make it impossible for everyday citizens to be part of a defense force like the "" militia"".
"
2,A militia is NOT a military unit. It is an assembly of men and women designed for point defense until the regular military can arrive. The National Guard is an organized militia but the militia referred to in the context of the Constitution consisted of all able bodies men with arms.You need to go back and study history and understand that the militia is a citizens group with only one purpose. To defend against tyrants and invaders in the event the military is busy elsewhere or the tyrant.An armed private citizen ensures that all the other amendments are not infringed or removed as well. And until you understand that simple concept you will continually be on the defense.

2,"You just put me through the most horrific torment, & I don't even know you...Congatulations on becoming the very person you dispise... "
2,"I seriously despise your remark about ""putting on camo and watching nascar"". Your shear ignorance about who in this country actually owns firearms negated the rest of your argument. The right to keep and bear arms is an individual right the supreme court decided that after reviewing countless records from the founding fathers and arguments from both sides. That's correct it is an INDIVIDUAL right so give up on this militia crap. Not to mention it doesn't even matter considering a militia is any able bodied citizen that volunteers to execute laws of the union, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion. Just in case you got confused execute laws of the Union is defined as the Constitution. Also I believe it was Thomas Jefferson who said ""For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well-organized and armed militia is their best security.""In today's age it is very possible for a militia to go up against a well armed and equipped fighting force, Vietnam was a great example but since they had help from big brother China I will just use the Taliban and Al-Queda they seem to be doing fairly well over in Afghanistan first against the Russians and now against us. Don't for a minute assume that all we care about is the second amendment I vehemently oppose any legislation that goes against any of the bill of rights. Just remember in the long run it is the 2nd amendment that keeps the other 9 safe from serious oppression. Does it happen that our rights are invaded, sure various laws have been passed that does and I have opposed and voted against any legislator that tries to infringe on my rights as a law abiding citizen. But I fail to see where international law and treaties tie into this I don't recall an amendment that states that we have to respect every treaty and law ever written and signed internationally. Keep this discussion at least close to on topic and stick with the problems within our own borders, deal with all the international stuff on another thread. "
2,"They said it is the right of the PEOPLE. That infers an individual right. You are attempting to blend two separate statements into a single definition. Typical of the Socialist's and Liberals.As far as taking on the American military, sorry again honey, but a large portion of those serving would not turn their guns on private citizens. You would see a civil war far deadlier than the first one. I was in the military at one time, and I know if I ever got an order to turn on the American people I would have executed my commanders as traitors to the Constitution and the nation. And I wasn't alone in that belief."
2,"This comment: ""Where do many sociopaths end up? In the   military  ."" is so insulting, it makes my blood boil. As a third generation veteran of the U.S. Army, married to a second generation veteran of the U.S. Air Force, and as an American who actually has respect for our military, I would advise you to shut your fat trap. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. The military in this country represent the bravest, most patriotic, most selfless among us. I have seen the pride that our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines take in their duty to defend this nation. And I have seen the lengths to which they will go to defend each other and others (my former team leader pulled 5 Iraqis out of a burning building with disregard for his own safety.) I would guess you don't know a single person in the military. But if you do, I hope they have a chance to read your stupid comment and let you know what they think of it. "

However, since you seem so good at lecturing everyone on things you obviously know nothing about let's start with the error that is the easiest to correct.There is no such entity as U.S.S.C. or United States Supreme Court. I think the entity that you meant to refer to is the Supreme Court of the United States or SCOTUS.Now that we have determined that you only think you know what you are talking about and so arrogantly presume to lecture people who actually do know what they are talking about, perhaps you would take the time to actually research your topic prior to making a fool of yourself.This has been covered so thoroughly (even on this web site) that I can't believe the debate even exists.

2," An individual right to bear arms helps protect against domestic tyranny The main intent of the Second Amendment of the constitution was to protect against domestic tyranny. An unfettered individual right to bear arms helps do so, by raising the potential costs to the government of engaging in tyrannical behavior. And, more to the point, it makes it possible for citizens to form a militia, as citizen gun-ownership is necessary to achieve this.

2,thats what i said
2,Well done!
1,"I served my three years in Israel, so I don't know how the states's armies work but this seems to me a logical difficulty. A militia should be under government control--if it's just a bunch of people getting together without government oversight, it's probably not a militia. It's a bunch of armed people. And I'm fine with militias, but it seems like an awful lot of people on here--and maybe this is a poor extrapolation, but possibly an awful lot of gun owners--take a lot of pride in the fact that the reason they own   guns   is to..destroy the government if need be. So can those people be members of a militia? Are they just lone nuts--or a large collection of lone nuts? Mob nuts? Has the US government just done an incredibly poor job vetting?"
2," Gun control does not solve the problem, education does.Watch these three clips and begin to understand your stance is one of ignorant fear.-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmrqT9SIkQw   - John Stossel 20/20-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyoLuTjguJA   - Canada's failed gun control-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGVAQOUi6ec   - England's failed gun control|-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkS8mdbml0A&NR=1   – Ask Ryan Lee Bergner what she thinks of the idea of disarming the law abiding citizen.-   http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4069761537893819675&p   - Suzanna Gratia Hupp this woman is dead on with her argumentOver 2,000,000 crimes are deterred annually by legally armed citizens. Again these facts can be verified by FBI crime data.And you say that a private citizen owning a firearm does not make them safe? The facts in evidence say you are wrong."
2,First it's an individual right.Second the intent of the Second amendment was clarified by the Federalist papers as well as many personal writings from the founding fathers that wrote it.You are attempting to twist the intent and definition of what a militia is. And you are incorrect. A militia is an group of able bodied men as defined by the Constitution that are assembled by private citizens (the people) to defend the state against all enemies both foreign and domestic.Penn and Teller define it very well:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GNu7ldL1LM&feature=related  
2,"It says the right of the people, not the right of the militia. Who is the militia anyway? All able bodied persons armed and capable of fighting with those weapons. So the militia is all armed people. That means it is an individual right to own   guns   and form together to fight an oppressive government."
2,"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.“By calling attention to ‘a well regulated militia’, the ’security’ of the nation, and the right of each citizen ‘to keep and bear arms’, our founding fathers recognized the essentially civilian nature of our   economy  . Although it is extremely unlikely that the fears of governmental tyranny which gave rise to the Second Amendment will ever be a major danger to our nation, the Amendment still remains an important declaration of our basic civilian-military relationships, in which every citizen must be ready to participate in the defense of his country. For that reason, I believe the Second Amendment will always be important.”John F. Kennedy, April 1960“Today, we need a nation of Minutemen, citizens who are not only prepared to take arms, but citizens who regard the preservation of freedom as the basic purpose of their daily life and who are willing to consciously work and sacrifice for that freedom."" -- John F. Kennedy "
2,"In the past, on numerous occasions, I have heard the argument presented that we don’t need   firearms   to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government because our government, the federal government of the United States would never turn against us.I have heard it said that gun owners are paranoid to believe that our federal government would turn against us.Well, I have to say that now our so-called paranoia has been justified.I believe it is safe to say that the federal government has officially become the tyrannical government that we warned about.The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Intelligence and Analysis has put out a report, titled ""Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,"" which, I dare say, defines half of the country as radical extremists whose activity must be monitored to ensure the safety of the country.After all the condemnations from the socialist liberals on the left about government spying on citizens of the United States, these same socialists, now in power, are using that very power to spy on citizens of the United States. And we’re not talking about naturalized people, we’re talking about Americans born and raised here. We’re talking about people who have sacrificed in the military to defend our freedom.We now have the most liberal, socialist person ever in the White House. Congress is controlled by socialist liberals and they intend to make the most of it.If you support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights of the United States, including the 1st, 2nd and 10th Amendments; if you object to an ever growing out of control government; if you have conservative or libertarian beliefs on certain social issues, you may consider yourself to be a radical extremist."
1,"He's not a criminal. It's the same reason we have laws against drunk driving. It's almost a pre-emptive   law  . Seung-Hui Cho bough two   guns  , bought ammunition off of eBay, went through background checks, walked onto campus, and before he fired the first shot he hadn't done anything illegal. This is a problem.Anyways, I hope that answers your question. Your rhetorical flair of Progressive = Dumbass is what keeps the ideas flowing smoothly in this country. Well done. You're like Cicero, sir."
2,"And show me where it says that ONLY members of a militia have the right to bear arms. This is a typical anti-gun misinterpretation of the 2nd Amendment, and it is wrong. The Supreme Court has said it's wrong, history has said it's wrong, and even our founding fathers have said it's wrong. ""Arms in the hands of the citizens may be used at individual discretion for the defense of the country, the overthrow of tyranny or private self-defense."" - John Adams""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms in his own lands."" - Thomas JeffersonI could go on.What it is saying is, since there is a need for a militia, the ""right to bear arms shall not be infringed."" Nowhere does it say that ""the right shall not be infringed if you are a member of a militia."" "
2,"Militias are relevant today as a symbol of preventing tyranny Historically, the militia that resisted the British was a non state managed association of people that were fighting against tyranny. The wording of the second amendment preserves the spirit of that time and therefore the word ""militia"" can be relevant to nowadays as a symbol of the right of people to fight against tyranny.In this way the spirit of the time is reflected in the letter of the law.
"
2,"Show me where I said a 12 year old should be able to drive a car. For that matter, show me anywhere in the   constitution   where it guarantees a 12 year old, a 20 year old, or a 100 year old the right to drive a car at all. Since that right is not guaranteed in the constitution, it can, and should be infringed, or at least limited. The constitution does guarantee the right to own weapons. The Supreme Court has even stated as much in Heller and other rulings. They have reviewed other writings of our founding fathers and determined that their intent was not limited to the militia or any government body. Also, can you show me where I said anyone should be able to buy a gun? I don't believe I said that. But as long as you meet the criteria that have been established by most states, I don't believe the government should have any say in it. I haven't been convicted of any crimes, I have not been adjudicated as mentally unstable, and I have met all the requirements my state has set forth. Further, there is no proof that taking away my   guns   will make anyone safer. None, nada, zip, zilch. There is plenty of proof to the contrary, however. "

2," The question of what they mean to Americans is simple in my experience. It is a matter of taking care of yourself. I do not rely on the government to feed me, drive me to work, tell me what to believe, what to read  or what to say so why should I rely on them to protect me? I grew up in the Long Beach and Los Angeles area and I was in college there during the Rodney King Riots and I can tell you that the people who fared the best were the ones who were armed and made sure the looters knew it! I grew up in a household that had many firearms (some of which were fully automatic as my father was with the Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement for 30 years). Not once were they ever misused. When the night fell and we could see the fires we readied our arms and kept vigil through the night in case the rioters came near. The police could not help us if someone showed up (the police did a valiant job but were horribly outnumbered). It was up to us and we all knew it. The only restriction I agree with is that automatics should be licensed because in the hands of the unskilled they can have unintended consequence. I do not have a problem with hi-cap mags though as they level the playing field when a civilian comes up against full auto firing felons. I do not believe the police should use full auto either as you should only shoot as quickly as you can aim. Criminals do not have to account for every shot they fire but police do. Give them hi-cap semis just like we civilians have. I have had extensive experience with full auto but would prefer a semi in a fire fight. I worry when the government starts telling me what I can and can not have. They say they want to get guns out of the hands of the criminals, well so do I! But how is limiting the rights of law abiding people going to do that? Criminals break the law - that is why they are called criminals. I would rather have everyone in a room be armed than only have the criminals have weapons. "
2,"I've read through many of the comments, and I thought I would add my own comments to the foray.First of all, I want to establish that morality plays the primary role in this discussion. Morality issubjective. What one believes is right, and wrong. These ideas may or may not coincide with whatyou or I believe, however they deserve the chance to be voiced. Hitler was viewed as evil to themajority of the world, though he himself, and his most dedicated of followers, believed that theywere right, and the only thing to prove that they were wrong, was escalation of force. Hitler wasoverthrown during WW2 and committed suicide, the only thing that this proved was that we as partof the Allies, had the might and motivation to prove that our moral standpoint was the right one. Osama Bin Laden, believes that his actions against the U.S.A. and any supporter of our country, as  well as the majority of the countries who do not follow his beliefs, are evil. These are moralstandpoints, and really cannot be argued to totality except through escalation of force.Having stated such, I currently serve in the U.S. Army, as a soldier, I am required, and proud tobe able to defend my country, and the rights they believe in. Now, defending a person(s) orcountries ""rights"" is not just a defensive measure. In times of need, when required OFFENSIVEstrategies are required to ensure that a person(s) or entities ""rights"" are thereby preserved throughthe course of time. If we would have known beyond a reasonable doubt, that 9/11 was going tohappen, and stopped the course of events before the 9/11 tragedy occurred, would any of yousit back a say ""Well they didn't pull it off, let's let bygones be bygones.""? no, we would not.We would as we are today, be afraid that something like this would happen, might happen, and something worse would happen. We would be obligated to go on the offensive and our actionsare justified by the reasoning that a person intends us harm.Just by being a soldier, I am doing something that less that 1% of the total of the U.S. populationcannot, or will not do. However, against all odds, I hope and pray, that when the day comes, thata foreign entity decides that they have the audacity to invade the U.S.A., that I will have my fellowcountrymen take up whatever arms they can acquire, be it fully automatic rifles, pistols, grenades,dynamite, nitroglycerin, or C4 explosive, and help me and my comrades defend what we believeis right and just. Saying that this will never happen is like saying that 9/11 will never happen. Well,it happened, and the only thing one needs to do is take an interest in history to notice that theonly thing another country needs to invade another country is greed, envy of what another countryhas, that they want for themselves.My father was military for the majority of my adolescence. He taught me a respect for guns, andweapons of all nature. I've had, or used a weapon of some type since I was 5 years old. I am now32 years old. What would I do, if our country decided that a person did not have the ""right"" tokeep and bear arms? I know what I would do, I would hide my weapons against any search andseizure, and continue to keep them for purposes of protection, be it defensive or offensiveprotection. I will not ever, capitulate to any aggressive entity that will threaten the lives of my family,or myself, not the property that we have worked hard for."
2,"Does a criminal care about the law? Obviously not. If anyone advocating gun control laws, and/orcomplete anti-fun prohibition could understand that no matter how many laws you pass, you willnot stop a criminal from getting what they want, we might not even be having this debate. Go to a""ghetto"" talk to some people, I can assure you, that before the day is over, you will have acquireda weapon for between 100 and 400 dollars. A criminal doesn't care what laws they are breaking, all they need to do, is find a source that will supply them with weapons, be it internally from the USor externally from another country. A person can acquire any type of weapon they want to withoutnotice, aside from nuclear weapons, and even those are starting to become more widelyaccessible.So should you own a gun? In my opinion yes, guns don't kill people, people kill people. No matterwhat kind of reasoning you try to support it with, a gun is nothing by a tool, a means to an end. Aperson provides the intent. Without the person, you have a tool that serves no purpose. The onlyway to remove the intent is to remove the person, not the tool. A weapon comes in many forms,from a butter knife, to a span of rope used for a garrote, or a baseball bat used to bludgeon.Should we ban anything and everything that resembles a weapon, or can be used as a weapon?Might as well ban all forms of writing utensils, because a pen, and pencil can be used to killa person. Anything can become a weapon, as long as the person has the will and intent to makeit so.Banning guns, only serves to prevent those who wish to arm themselves against forces unseenfrom gaining access to said protection. A person, has the ""right"" to use an equal amount of forceas the aggressor is using. Aside from that, my personal belief is that a person should in the faceof danger to life, limb or eyesight, use whatever means of force of escalation within their means, beit excessive or not, to retain their personage whole and complete. I will not, ever, capitulate to a gun control law if I feel that, said law violates my personal motivations of protecting my family andmy valuables."

2,"To maintain the handgun ban a change in the constitution is imperative The constitution is the basis for allowing gun possession within the US society. All court decisions go back to the Second Amendment text and interpret it either  by the spirit of the law or by the letter of the law. The actual possibility of possession of guns within the US society is  guaranteed through the existence of the amendment per se. Constant interpretations and different conclusions drawn upon the same text mean that any radical decisions regarding banning guns can always be argued against based on the same text of the amendment.If consensus is reached about enacting such a change within society such as banning guns than it must be legitimized  by a change in the constitution .In this will reflect a common will of the people in the  foundation  of all the legal system within the US i.e the constitution.

I can pretty much with a 99% certainty guarantee you won't even watch any of the videos provided either No you will continue to cower in fear due to ignorance while good honest law abiding citizens are out there protecting you by exercising their right to carry.The bottom line is you and your agenda are not the solution, you are part of the problem. But you are incapable of admitting or seeing that since you use emotion instead of logic, reason and intelligence guide your through life. Too bad too, you are in a position to actually provide a solution through education, but you chose instead to use fear and ignorance. Just like the last administration did and so the current one will continue to do.Sincerely a law abiding gun owner"
2,"Well I do not know about you but when the majority of people read the second amendment, Supreme Court,President Obama,Eric Holder,all the Harvard Law reviews,Yale and etc. they all conclude it to an individual right not given by the second amendment but guarrenteed. Of course like most people who are blind to the truth, they will not be told otherwise even when the evidence is abundant. Let them live in their fairy tale,Those of us who know the truth and seek the truth should join with organizations that support our rights. The largest is the National Rifle Association, that will get a rise out of some, but think about it why do you really suppose the NRA is so successful, they try to deal with the facts, hence they are very susscesful.

2,"Guns mean to Americans.............""My government says I am a free citizen with rights and that I can own a piece of power and protection from the sick and predator infested   society   that surrounds me, my neighborhood, and family. Guns mean to Americans...........""It is my right to kill   food   for sport or pleasure so I can fill my freezer with game that I like to eat"". Guns also mean that people enjoy sport   shooting   and it is a classic past time of fun for a family. However you wanna look at it, ""Guns mean Power"" to ones self through a number of different uses. Guns are Power, America is Power."

2,You know I grew up with   guns   and guess what not once did I play with them.  The were under my Dad's bed or in his night stand by the bed. Why do   kids   find it facinating to play with something that can hurt them.  Easy their parents haven't taken them out to show them how a gun works and what it's used for.  Once a child is educated and taught respect for things that aren't theirs to play with we would be a lot better off in   society  .
1,"I find it so absurd to think that we need to have 10 times more   guns   and rifles than the rest of the world!  Where did this fanaticism to own so many guns originally start?  Why do people need an AK-47 rifle or machine gun to go   hunting   for deer?  Its absurd!  The NRA is so far outside the mainstream now and cares nothing about being more reasonable and pragmatic!  They are so extreme in their thinking, that Pres George Herbert Walker Bush, a life-long member of the NRA, terminated his membership when they refused to agree to any sensible   gun control   measure including the Brady Bill!  We need to place strong controls on how many weapons can be manufactured and ration the number that anyone person can have!  Nobody needs more than 2 guns! Fines should be stiffened if not obeyed and if these fanatical gun owners don't like it who cares!  The government knows whats best for the American people when it comes to owning guns!"
2,"{The government knows whats best for the american people when it comes to owning   guns  }How can you be so wrong.The government would like every one to think like you.So they can take all your freedoms away![Nobody needs more than 2 guns]Where do you get those numbers?You dont know much about guns do you?To some it is a sport.Like sex or   cars  .Should a person be able to own more than 2 cars or have sex with more than 2 people,in you own little world? Cars kill more people than guns?In your little world why dont you outlaw people so no person can get killed?"
1,"You must be a card carrying member of the NRA because thats the line they always use that if there is any type of   gun control   whatsoever, than other freedoms will be lost!  How absurd! The government is the people and I stand by my facts which comes from published sources!  We have by far, my   guns   than anybody else!  Our founding fathers never intended for us to own so many weapons-it was for a militia in the states!  There should be restrictions, background checks, and a major tax on all weapons sold here to discourage the sale of   firearms  -like   cigarettes  !  When guns get too expensive for these people, that will have the desired effect!"
2,"[we have by far,my   guns   than anybody else}OK than.You need to try some freedom!You might like it!"
2," If 2nd amendment applied only to militias it would be useless today If the Second Amendment applied only to the collective right of the militia, it would be useless, as no militias exist today in America. It is highly unlikely that the Framers designed an amendment that could expire over time. Instead, their intention was to extend rights to individuals in the Constitution that are lasting.

I like a good and civil debate on just about any issue! I do take back what I said earlier about the government restricting the sales of   guns   to 2 per family!  Hunters and sportsmen in general, are   law   obedient, responsible gun owners-I don't really have a problem with them at all!I count you as one of them because I realize I struck a raw nerve with you especially, and I'm sure your an avid hunter and responsible!"

1,"I thought state rights and slavery were the primary causes of the Civil War-not the abolishment of a militia!  You got me there!  I thought militias were replaced over time by the state national guard?  The people were encouraged during the Revolutionary War to volunteer and help fight against the British.  The   congress   which is the people's house, made a decision after we won our independence to abolish the militia!  You conservatives are always railing against the government-but if any of your cherished benefits are cut you people are the first to complain!  The government has done an incredible job in taking care of us over the years!  The Tennessee Valley Authority brought   jobs   and electricity to the south during the Depression and helped improve these people's standard of living!  Worker's safety,   food   safety, the National Cancer Institute, the US Post Office, AMTRACK, and The Deal, during Roosevelt's time, are just few examples that government got it right! I was probably overboard in my comments about   gun control   but I get so fed up by all these lunatics on the right who always criticize the government but never have any feasible alternatives!  I'm not calling you a lunatic mike1948!  I guess   guns   are a unique, sacred right here and nowhere else!  "
1,"I'll assume for arguements sake, that you are correct that Lincoln nationalized the state militias-I would to when these states are about to go to war against the union!

Not sure what your point was other that you think people have the right to own   guns  ! As a true pacifist, I would be horrified at huge numbers of guns that are sold to people and the carnage from these guns perpetrated onto socieity!  Drive by shootings, school shootings where   kids   are senselessly murdered.  Go to any urban hospital and talk to   doctors   in the emergency rooms, and they will tell you about victims who were shot! Urban warfare exists in many of our cities due in part, to the proliferation of guns and the easy access to get them.  But the NRA has always been against background checks, or any common sense measures to make sure that guns don't get in the wrong hands!  The 2 kids at Columbine High School stole their guns from one of the gunmen's grandfather and then massacred all those innocent people!  Hunters and sportsmen are fine as long as they keep their arsenal secured and out of the reach of minors!  Of course, I still don't think you need a machine gun or a AK-47 to go out and kill bambi either! "
2,"Well it is our right and no one should try to take it away from us.Now I know there are many many idiot's out there who misuse them,but you can't punish everbody cause some guy got shot by some idiot.Guns are a responsibity that should be taken serious, and when not then THE GUITY PERSON SHOULD BE DEALT WITH HARSHLY not everone esle,and folk's this is coming from a guy who has lost someone to a firearm killing!!!!"

1," Rifles and shotguns are as effective as handguns in self-defense There is little evidence that a handgun is a more effective as a means to self-defense than a rifle or a shotgun. At a minimum, there is nothing to suggest that a shotgun and a rifle are ineffective as self-defense weapons. Some suggest that a shotgun is actually a superior choice for purposes of self-defense as it is a more devastating weapon to an assailant than a handgun, which may only slightly impair an intruder.  
"
2,Never back down Your right on Silverfang838!keep up the fight!
2,"Adam,How fast does it take for a police officer to be dispatched to a given location on average?For most places, it's 3-5 mins.Most violent crimes take much less time to complete.Those of us that buy and carry guns for protection are sobered by this fact. All ""pro gun"" and ""anti gun"" folks agree that violent crime is a problem.  The big difference being that many anti-gun folks feel that the police are a good enough resource.  The fact is, the police are not required to protect you from crime.  Look it up, the supreme court has ruled on this fact.  While the police are necessary, their role in reality is a general duty to enforce the laws.  [South v. Maryland, 59 U.S. (How.) 396, 15 L.Ed., 433 (856)].The duty to protect yourself is up to YOU.  Now, if you don't like guns, that's fine with me.  I happen to think they are a great way for a person to protect themselves.  I'd encourage you to try shooting for yourself to see for yourself.In closing, I'd reverse the question on you and say, why should the government be allowed to forcibly keep me from protecting myself and my loved ones?I don't like answering questions with other questions, but I think in this case it's appropriate.""How well has banning illegal drugs helped stem their use?""I think you see where I'm going with this.  When you restrict guns, all you end up doing is giving more power to people to use guns illegally.  You strip the power for regular, law-abiding citizens to use them for their own defense."
2,"The idea that ""communities should be able to decide""--How far does that go, or does local rule only apply to the second amendment?  Was it interference of ideologically-driven outsiders when civil rights organizers came from halfway across the country to try to end racial segregation?  Does the city get to forbid a Muslim Mosque?  There is a pretty clear divide between lawful gun owners and criminals.  The ones that will be stopped by a law aren't the ones you need worry about--they will obey the existing laws against murder and assault.   The ones who will murder and assault aren't going to obey gun laws, either.  I keep seeing statements that the Brady Campaign and their associates won't violate the fundamental right to bear arms, but I have never seen a statement of what guns we would have left, if the Brady Campaign were completely successful.    I suspect .22 bolt-action rifles, .410 shotguns and not much else. All of the following have been proposed as ""reasonable restrictions"":The assault weapons ban covered guns that held too much ammo, or looked scary. It covered handguns that were too large and heavy.  It regulated bayonet mounts and the way the wood was carved.   It forbid handguns that were too large, or that held their magazines in front of the grip, or that were called ""Uzi"".   The Gun Control Act of 1967 covered imported Saturday Night Specials that working class people could afford.   Several localities have extended that restriction to domestically produced guns with the same features and design.  Guns .50 caliber and larger are ""too powerful"" and ""used to bring down airplanes"". A ban on ""cop killer"" bullets capable of penetrating police body armor.  Many people not familiar with the details would think that these are all reasonable restrictions.  However: The Glock models 17 and 22 are the standard full-sized handgun that many police departments issue. They are large enough that many departments issue the slightly smaller models 19 and 23 instead.  All of these guns, as carried by tens of thousands of policemen were covered by the now expired assault weapons ban--""too big"" for civilians to carry unless you used special reduced capacity magazines.  Oddly, they are also covered by the 1967 law--Glock has to put click-adjustable sights on them to get enough ""points"" so they are not classified as a ""Saturday Night Special"" or ""Junk Gun"".   The click sighs are generally replaced by the original versions by the importer before sale.  If these guns are simultaneously too big and too small, what is left in between? The ""cop killer"" rules would ban ALL common rifle ammunition except .22 rimfire.  The standard body armor as worn by police is only meant to protect against handguns--in order to protect against rifle with current technology, the armor would need to be far bulkier than it is.   Some of the laws that are promoted as banning the .50BMG also cover revolutionary war flintlock muskets, and all common shotguns except the .410.  There is usually an exception for shotguns ""particularly suitable for sporting purposes"" as decided by some bureaucrat-- But we promise this won't be used to take *your* shotgun, honest. . Hollow point ammo is ""so deadly it is forbidden to be used in warfare"", and therefore not suitable.  Jacketed ammo is ""too military"".  To me, gun rights represent freedom and self-reliance rather than subservience.  They do not represent the right to use my gun to get my way--If I use a gun or the threat of one to win an argument, I should be prosecuted and go to jail.  I already have the power to take life.  The gun gives me the power to protect life and liberty.  "
2,"I'm not sure what you are responding to.   Maybe it would be more productive to find out what restrictions you think are reasonable and constitutional.  Which of the proposed or actual laws I mentioned above are reasonable, and why?  Are any of my facts in error? Where is the line between a constitutional local law and an unconstitutional infringement?  "
2,"Adam,-I don't trust my community to make decisions about my self defense any more than I trust them to make decisions about how I should raise my   kids  . And I live in Tennessee, which is a fairly gun friendly state, despite or non gun friendly governor. The community has no right to make decisions that directly affect my personal safety just so they can feel safer.-Protecting yourself may not be a duty, but I don't see how you could argue that protecting your family is. I, however, consider protecting myself a duty, as I am the provider for my family. But I certainly won't tell you that it is your duty. I'm out of your life. All I'm asking is that you get out of mine.-You may disagree that gun restrictions only have negative effects, but there is ample evidence that they do NOT have the positive effects that the   gun control   lobby suggests they will. There is also pretty solid evidence that less restrictions for   law  -abiding citizens have a positive effect. ---For example, Washington D.C. implemented their gun ban in 1976, and between 1976 and 1991, the   homicide   rate there rose 200% while the rest of the country saw only a 12% increase. ---In ""More Guns, Less Crime"" John Lott showed that concealed carry laws accounted for 8.5% decrease in the   murder   rate, a 5% decrease in rape, and 7% decrease in assaults.-I really don't see why   gun rights   represent the freedom to threaten terrible violence. Remember that when we talk about gun rights we are only speaking of those who should have   guns   in the first place. No organization, pro or anti-gun, advocates more guns in the hands of criminals. That's just ludicrous. It's illegal now, and it will continue to be illegal. ---In addition, if you take a look at statistics, you will find that carry permit holders in the U.S. are among the most law-abiding citizens in the U.S. Very, very rarely do the ""display"" their guns when in public. The majority of permit holders carry concealed for myriad reasons. Among them is respect for those that are less familiar or scared of guns, to avoid any type of elevated tensions.---Gun ownership may not help your sense of security, but to be blunt, that's just tough. I'm not asking you to carry a gun, or to even own one and keep it locked in a safe. And the truth of the matter is, if you don't live in one of the two states that completely prohibit you from carrying a gun, you have unknowingly stood in line behind a person carrying a gun. You have sat across from them at a restaurant. You have bumped into them walking down the street. Is it your experience that gun owners just take their guns out and wave them around for everyone to see? Of course not. That's because we take the responsibility of gun ownership very seriously. We, as a whole, are more versed in   gun laws   than the general population because we have to be constantly aware of where and when we can and cannot carry. We, as a whole, are better trained and more practiced than many (not all, of course) law enforcement agents. And there are PLENTY of quotes from the Brady Campaign that show that they seek to ban all   firearms   eventually, in a phased approach.-What about ideologically-driven insiders? As of now, the   supreme court   has ruled that I have a right to carry a firearm, as long as I am not a convicted criminal, etc. But the state of Illinois says I don't have that right. And they say it because they are ideologically-driven, not fact driven. There are no studies that show a correlation between gun control and a decrease in   crime  , so what other motivation can they have besides ideology? "
2,"Sorry Adam, I don't mean to be rude, but since you can't see me or hear me it may come off that way.  The simple fact is that your community doesn't have the right or the moral authority to democratically limit the rights of gun owners in your community.  I know that you said ""constitutionally acceptable"", but realistically there are only two limitations that you can place on gun ownership that would fit within that description.  Those would be, in a broad sense, the ability to restrict felons and insane persons from owning guns through an instant background check process, and to restrict the use of guns for anything other than their intended purpose (e.g. Self-Defense, target shooting, hunting etc.)  Any other restriction, e.g. the type of firearms or restricting the use of guns or the transportation of guns is all unconstitutional.  One thing you must ALWAYS keep in mind that the people within the Brady Campaign will NEVER tell you is that only people who are generally law abiding will obey the rules you put in place anyway.  That criminals will ALWAYS have guns and will NEVER follow the rules, because they are criminals!  Putting restrictions on guns only limits the people who are willing to follow those laws and puts your average American at a distinct disadvantage.  By the way, the ""national organization"" only fights to protect the rights of those in the minority who are being demonized, they do not have an agenda to tell people what they can do, unless they are trying to restrict God given, Constitutionally protected rights.  Thank you.  Matt"
2,"Adam, I understand where you are coming from.  The rub is what's constitutionally acceptable.  I tend to feel that ""shall not be infringed"" really does mean what it says.Generally, what some forget (or never knew in the first place) is that the bill of rights (and the constitution, generally) is established precisely to limit democratically-elected governments.  It surprises me that Americans think they can legislate various infringments of the first, or second, or fourth amendments simply because the majority of the people want such legislation.  We tend to view democratically-made decisions as the epitome of civilization ... and conveninently forget that ""mob rule"" is also democratic.  The bill of rights protects those fundamental human rights from democracy ... whether that be a voting electorate or a mob.The very the purpose of these fundamentally basic rights - worship, speech, petitioning the government, gun ownership, etc. - is that they never be infringed democratically. "
2,"I am hard pressed think of any weapon you showed to a continental soldier or framer would be outside his imagination.  At the time of the Constitutional Congress, ALL rifles were assault rifles.The entire purpose of the 2nd Amendment is to ensure the civilian populace has the power to overthrow the government.  I understand the utility of instant checks to keep powerful weapons from felons and the insane, but who has what should never be in a database.  We saw what the Germans did with that information, and we should all be very suspicious of anyone who claims ""it can't happen here.""Vigilance is among the smaller costs of freedom.-James"
2,"I have to agree with Vigilance on this one...The common folk had the same weaponry that the governments had other than cannon...Cannons were not an everyday luxury for most citizens..Todays populous hardly has the capabilities the government has...We the people give the government the authority it has, to accumulate its' arsenal...Why is it the government would take my putrid weaponry ???"
2,"Why do you want to take my weaponry ??  My conflict is not only with my Represetntatives but also with neighbors like YOU...What are you afraid of from me ,I do not flaunt my gun in your face...I do not use my gun illegally...Why are you so eager to throw away your forefathers experience & knowledge about how government can put you into servitude..Your government just passed a record financial debt on you ,placing you & your children into servitude...Maybe you have a self destructive nature to want us all to become defenceless...I can't help you perpatrate that which I believe to be a fudamental mistake on my part or on societys' part... SORRY..."
1," The 2nd Amendment does not express a right to bear arms for self-defense The 2nd Amendment does not explicitly refer to a right to bear arms for the purpose of self-defense. It only explicitly refers to a right to bear arms for the purpose of upholding ""a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State."" The 2nd Amendment should not be read as conferring a right that it does not clearly confer; a right to arms for the purpose of self defense. Inferences are insufficient, particularly as evidence can be gathered regarding the intentions of the framers of the Constitution that could cut both for and against the notion that the 2nd amendment was intended to confer an individual right to bear arms for the purpose of self-defense. Because neither inference can be definitely deemed correct, the Constitution must be taken at its explicit word, which gives no mention to self-defense.
"
2,"Adam, I appreciate and respect your reasoned and polite discourse.  If I may, I'll work through some of your comments.  Forgive me in advance if I get long-winded.First regarding your 5th paragraph statement ""older interpretation.""  Among constitutional scholars, the older interpretation is the ""standard model"" (individual right to arms), which is similar to the majority opinion in Heller.  The newer interpretations are called the ""collective rights"" (similar to the Rakove, Cornell et al. brief)and the even-newer ""sophisticated collective rights"" (similar to the Brady Center brief) models.  Regarding these newer, ""sophisticated"" interpretations, a statement from Alan Gura's brief (Respondent's brief in Heller) is germane here:  ""Petitioners plainly disagree with the Framers’ Second Amendment policy choices. Petitioners’ remedy must be found within the Constitution’s Fifth Article, not with linguistic sophistries or an anemic standard of review that would deprive the right of any real force.""  In other words, if you don't like it, you can repeal it.  But you cannot simply make it go away with sophisticated fabrications of the history and intent of the amendment. Refering to the right to own military small arms as a ""grey area"" (your 2nd paragraph), I argue that it seems grey today mostly because we have made it so over time.  I will get into this more in the next paragraph, but the justification (lawful defense of ""good"" - self, home, community, and nation) for the framers' protecting the right to arms is the same today as it was then.  And the arms they protected then certainly included military small arms.  Thus I would argue that the militia purpose of the second amendment (like you, I don't think the two clauses can be decoupled as perfectly as Scalia suggested) makes clear that the arms most precisely protected by the amendment are military small arms.Getting back to your 5th paragraph, regarding what is to be made of the ""well-regulated militia.""  For one, it is necessary to the security of a free state (state with a small ""s"").  So the SCOTUS (and many amici) argues that it is necessary to our free state, but then the majority pretty strongly decouples that purpose from the operative clause.  That is, even if the militia was not necessary, they argue, the guarantee ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms"" would mean the very same thing.  Generally, I agree with this, but personally feel the two cannot be decoupled quite so perfectly.  Why?  Because the militia IS fundamentally important, and arms are in part what fulfill the militia (and the modern legal mandate of the militia clauses in 10 USCode 311)."
2,"This is where the discussion is lost on all too many who view the world in somewhat unrealistically rosy glasses.  Backing up a bit now.  Throughout history, the strong and advantaged have often taken from others (eg. weak and disandvantaged) via coersion.  Barbaric.  ""Civilization"", however, made life better for most everyone but the barbarians.  While civilizations are characterized by division of labor, etc., they are also predicated upon sharing and upon agreements by those members of society ... agreements on what is right and wrong, acceptable and unacceptable, and on what is lawful and unlawful.  Civilizations work because ""good"" people contribute and are rewarded (generally) for doing so.  But there remain those ""bad"" people who still take advantage (when they are allowed to) via coersion.  It is this reality, in part, on which the guarantee to arms was predicated.  Arms were guaranteed so good people (civilized people) could protect themselves from bad people.  Not only ""could"" protect themselves, but WOULD protect themselves (thus reducing the bad people in society).  We all work to educate and train our fellow citizens, and to reward good behavior with gifts, honor, or a simple pat on the back.  We also work together (and establish criminal justice and rule of law) to punish bad people.  We pretty much all agree that murder and rape and robbery are bad and cannot be tolerated.  What the right to arms guarantees is that we as individuals, as first responders, have the power (we have the natural right, as well as the legal authority) to defend ourselves, families, and community via force of arms (it would be swords or clubs if firearms did not exist).  Security of a free state plays full into this, because the natural right to self defense cannot be decoupled from the right (and the necessity) to community and even national defense.  A well-regulated militia is a group of armed citizens (individuals) coming together in a time of need ... to dispell unlawful insurrections, to prevent looting after a natural disaster, or to repel an invading military force.  That militia is in agreement as to their purpose ... and that purpose is a good one because it maintains law and order, and promotes the safety and security of communities, states, and nations.And finally, from a statement you made above to Nitrogen: ""To me, guns rights represent the freedom to threaten terrible violence.""  I think that view is a rather common one, but I also think it is predicated on a misunderstanding of what freedom is, what rule of law is, and what gun rights are.  It is argued that humans (and all other living things) have a natural right to self defense via force.  But few would argue that we have any sort of right to offense.  The second amendment in no way whatsoever authorizes or gives any right to offense or to ""threaten terrible violence"" as you put it (by ""threaten"" I presume you mean ""offensive violence"").  The second amendment protects the right to own and carry arms (knives, saps, guns, whatever) for the purpose of lawful use of force ... be that to stop a common criminal in your home, a group of terrorist/insurrectionists such as the KKK of days gone by or the Timothy McVeighs of modern history, be that keeping the peace when our professional police force cannot, or be that repeling an invading force.  And even ... even ... as 20th century Russia and Germany have taught us is sometimes necessary, resisting and overthrowing outwardly tyrranical governments. "
2,"I am sorry for having gotten so long winded.  You chose an interesting one ... in your view that guns and gun rights protect a right to threaten violence.  I disagree, although depending on how we parse the characteristics of ""threat"" and ""deterrent.""  So, on one hand, I can see your view that guns might represent the ability to threaten violence.  In other words, it might be said that ""the homeowner's pistol represented a threat to the burglar.""  But although these claims can be made, I think a more honest approach is to explore the differences between what ""threaten"" and ""deter"" connote.  I will argue that the history and the intent of the second amendment (and the purpose of gun ownership) aligns more closely with deterrence than with threat.Webster's unabridged defines ""deter"" as ""to discourage, to prevent, or to hinder"" (eg. the presence of the police officer deterred the thief).  Threaten is defined as a ""declaration of an intention to inflict injury or punishment, or to indicate impending evil or mischief"" (eg. the thief threatened to stab me if I did not turn over my wallet).  Take personal defensive weapons, for example.  Forty-eight states have laws that allowed licensed, concealed carry of loaded defensive weapons, while about half the states allow open (visible) carry of a gun (some require a license, others don't).  I bring up open carry because the more common concealed part complicates my point.  Take two men, strangers, walking down the sidewalk in Burlington, Vermont (where it is legal to carry a firearm openly, without any restrictive license).  Each of the men have a holstered Colt 1911 on their hip.  At this point, neither of the men are threatening violence (nor, of course, do they have any right to).  They each walk into the same jewelry store, and browse around.  Suddenly, one of the men pulls his pistol, points it at the teller, and demands ""give me the money or I will shoot you.""  At this point, that man is threatening violence, which he of course has no right to do.  So the other armed man quickly draws his gun and stops this threat of criminal violence with a well-placed head shot.  This action is lawful because state statutes declare that the use of lethal force is authorized to prevent death or grave bodily injury of yourself and others, or to stop the commission of a forcible felony.  I would argue that the second man represented a deterrent instead of a threat.  Two men, two guns, two actions ... one a threat, and the other a deterrent."

1,"I can't imagine that the American founding fathers intended that the United States would end up with more gun violence than comparable countries. However, that is what has happened. In other countries there are tight restrictions on guns and there are many fewer gun deaths. It therefore makes sense for Americans to find ways of reducing gun violence within the constitutional limits that are imposed."
2,"WELL said ,they were aware of the dangers therin,and at the same time they wrote the second ammendment....Sounds like foreknowledge...Todays ELITE & intellectuals have a long way to go to catch the smarts of our fathers..."
2,And what power would the people have without a gun to back them up ???
2,"There is NO comparable Country ..The USA is unique to it's own LAW...What are we independant from if not the rest of the Worlds' thinking...Who is it that built a Country to be the envy of the Nation ,those who all want a piece of the pie...American pie...We have been the Country who now has to spread the wealth..Wher are the rest of you & your wealth ?? Pass some our way...The World used the USA to handle their problems...I give & give ,yet you want my gun....Cut it out .... "

2,"Are there more killings each year by ""ordinary"" folks or by criminals and thugs? And what business did an 8 year old have even having access to a gun unsupervised? That's not the   constitution  's fault. That's the parent's fault. You're not going to get rid of the   guns  . Face it. So don't try and take mine so that I'm a helpless victim. "
2," The Second Amendment confers the individual right to self defense   Modern legal scholarship  posits that the amendment is the affirmation of the the individual freedom to posses guns and use them for self protection.James Madison's original version of the amendment described the militia as comprised of people . This reflects the framer's intent to extend this freedom to every citizen as a right to self protection .The amendment reflects the philosophical foundation of the American societies built as counter hegemonic culture formed and perpetuated by the preservation of freedom.

1,"Actually we will get rid of   guns  . It's just a question of time. Just as gay marriage will be legalised - just as the right have lost, and will continue to lose every significant social battle, including slavery and granting women the vote. The bibles will also go and we will all grow up... the world will move forward... And you will be lost, just as the dinosaurs were... evolve people... evolve - or be lost to the legers of history."
2,"While you might be correct that   guns   will be banned, though I certainly hope not, to say we will get rid of guns is misguided and ignorant. If you, for one second think that criminals will be denied guns just because they are legally banned, you are not in touch with reality. Look at the   drug war  . Cocaine is illegal today for use by anyone, but you don't see that slowing down the use of it, do you?And thank you so very much for resorting no name calling and insults. It only serves to validate my point and paint you as an extremist who cannot be swayed by facts or logic. You're making the job of those who need to ""evolve"" much easier. And maybe when YOU grow up, you'll see what I mean."
2,"I think if one would look at the laws passed,(and for that matter proposed, one will find that the law abiding citizen is the one impacted by gun control laws. It is a hard thing to deal with the reality that criminals do not buy their guns,they steal them, and then commit crimes. I am wondering where the criminals sense of being law abiding is. As a gun owner, I want more than most to see the crimes committed with a gun to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.I will say it again, in another way, send em to Gitmo. It infuriates me when I behave in a law abiding fashion, and have that behavior threaten my freedoms. As to those who think I should not have a gun just because it scares you, my apologies. You may not , however have my gun(s)"
2,"If the government could pass laws that would make it harder for criminals to get guns without negatively affecting the rest of us gun owners.The problem with the types of laws you support, is it makes it harder for EVERYONE to get a gun, not just criminals.  Much like Illegal drugs, people will find ways to get whatever they want, no matter what restrictions you put on those items.That's why I wish groups like yours would take emphasis off of gun restrictions, and focus more on the actual criminals that commit the actual crimes."
2,"the brady campaign is a dangerous organization!  They seek to change our constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms.  The second amendment is very clear on its intent.  It is to protect us from our government should it become our enemy which happens worldwide.  where we live it takes cops a half and hour to arrive in the event that your life is in danger. The right to self defense is a god given right,not necessary to get permission from the brady communist campaign to protect our own life.  these people that support the brady bunch would have done well when adolf hitler was in power. use violence to subdue the citizens and if they dont agree with you,kill them."
2,"I dont know if you are aware of the fact that one of the first things hitler did was take away the right to bear arms from the german people. he would send them into battle to die,but you were not allowed to own a firearm. my grandparents were from germany. and propaganda is one of the things that the brady bunch thrives on.  doctors kill untold thousands with their daily meds,alchohol kills around 400,000 people a year,but the brady bunch worries about firearms.  and yes the brady bunch is a subversive ,lying bunch of anti constitution socialists who thinks the government should meddle in every aspect of our lives. grow up! you listen to tv propaganda too much."
2,"Then why did Sarah Brady stand on the senate floor and state ""How are we to bring about a socialistic form of government, if every American citizen has a right to own and bear arms."" ???????????????"
2,"You brought up a lot of points so I am going to try and discuss each one separately and in order.First of all the Supreme Court decided that the second amendment is an individual right after looking at what the founding fathers wrote in letters, memos, etc.. at the time not to mention the state constitutions that were written at the time. Is it crappy language? Possibly but since the militia is any citizen from 17-45 that includes most everyone anyways so I am not going to say anything else about that.You can purchase a firearm from any person legally able to own a firearm at any time gun shows have nothing to do with it. Also you have to be residents of the same state to make a private purchase of a firearm. So leave the gun shows out of it all the vendors selling there are federally licensed and bound by law to do background checks. Guns in a home are not more likely to injure or kill another person in the home the USDOJ estimates guns are used 2.5 million times a year to prevent a violent crime. since there are only about 1000 accidental deaths a year caused by firearms I fail to see how that correlates to being more likely to get injured or die. Gun owners must know something they have a better shooting record than cops according to the Journal of Quantitative Criminology. This limits it down to concealed weapon permit holders but according to all of the ones I have met all permit holders are gun guys who practice a lot but not all cops I have met are gun guys and some have admitted to only going to the range once a year to qualify. As for the rest of your discussion I agree completely that the biggest problem in the US is the perception of firearms specially the problem with how they are portrayed in the media. I think that a firearms education class would be a wonderful idea and it wouldn't be to hard to teach along side sex-ed(since most kids go through that about then, well at least I did). I am aware that shooting tests are not required to purchase a gun that would completely overload the system and probably make the class so short it would be pointless, but most states do require a class with a shooting test to get your concealed weapons permit. I doubt asking questions would get you anywhere people would just lie that's human nature. But I completely agree with the education part that is why I am getting my instructor certification this summer and I attempt to take as many people out to the range as possible to teach them about firearms and the safe ways to handle them. As for your statement that handguns are cowardly I wholly resent that remark. It is your choice to say you will never own or carry one but to say those that do are cowardly is crossing the line. So that makes every cop in America a coward because they carry a handgun. I admit I carry a handgun on a daily basis because I accept the responsibility for my personal safety I don't leave it up to someone else and I also accept the fact that bad things can happen. I also carry because I will do anything and everything in my power to protect those that I love so why not be able to carry and use the best weapon at your disposal instead of carrying something that might work(such as mace) or study a martial art for years that is completely negated when some punk walks up with a gun of his own and is out of arms reach(right now I know you are saying ""you wouldn't have time to draw or drawing a gun on a drawn gun is stupid which is very true but if you see the attacker coming and you cant get away then you have time to draw and yes I have drawn my handgun in self defense against an attempted car jacking with a knife.) So all in all I really wish we could better educated the kids in this country about firearms but sadly instead of taking a proactive approach the politicians decide to attempt to ban them instead, which you said yourself wont work not to mention its been proven not to work in several countries including England and Australia.

2,"Why don't you go talk to the dead Jews from Germany ???OR, all the WWII casualties,or all the dead Iraqies, who fought against the similar views you try to propogate..."
2,"While I agree with your basic point, (I think) you certainly come off as irrational and a tad bit crazy.  It just gives the other side more ammunition.  Is the Brady Campaing dangerous?  Yes.  Does that statement need to be the first line with an exclaimation point, in an argument that isn't even about the Brady Campaign?  No.  You're on the right track, but you need to take a chill pill and present your arguments in a calm, rational and reasonable way.  If you sound like  a crazy person, you're not going to convince them that letting you keep your guns is a good idea.  "
2," A ban on legal handguns disadvantages citizens against armed criminals. Criminals, who are able to acquire guns,irrespective of the illegality of doing so, welcome a ban on legal handgun ownership. This is because it decreases the risks that they will rob or attack a citizen that has a handgun, and whom may attack back. 
"
2,"Unfortunately, Paul Helmke has such a proclivity for stretching the truth or outright lying, that I can hardly bring myself to believe that he ever shot at the YMCA.  The only reason I could believe it is that he grew up in Indiana where they actually honor the Second Amendment to the Untied States Constitution for the most part.  Paul Helmke says, ""Guns are always going to be available to law-abiding citizens.  But we can take steps to make it harder for dangerous people to get dangerous weapons.""  Unfortunately Mr. Helmke is not being completely honest here.  What he leaves out is that SOME guns will always be available to law-abiding citizens (unless we at the Brady Campaign have our way).  If you look at the Brady Campaign's history they have always supported gun bans, and such severe restrictions and taxes, that guns would only be available to the richest Americans.  Please take a look at the laws on the books, all 20,000 or more and tell me if there is anything that should be illegal for someone to do with a gun that is not already illegal.  Once you have done that, ask yourself, ""Why doesn't the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence focus on preventing gun violence?""  They could easily do this by lobbying for harsher punishment of people who buy guns for someone who is not legally allowed to (commonly called straw purchasers), and by arresting people for attempting to buy guns when they are ineligible and they know it (like a felon trying to buy a gun to commit yet another crime). If they focused on these things along with educated children on what to do when they find a gun, they might actually accomplish their stated purpose... reducing gun violence.  They won't do those things because they WANT gun violence to be high so that they can continue to push banning guns and further restricting guns so that fewer and fewer people own them.  The Brady Campaign has no shame in its push to ban so-called ""Assault Weapons"" which are really just semi-automatic guns, no different, and in fact less powerful than 90% of hunting rifles, because they claim that these rifles are only used for mass killings and assaults.  The problem with that logic is that less than 1% of all gun related crime is committed with these so-called ""assault weapons"".  So obviously when the Brady Campaign says that all they want is logical compromise, what they really mean is outright bans on all guns, except those that they personally approve of.  -Matt"
2,"Never has an anti-gun organization proposed anything that could ever be misconstrued as 'reasonable'Spokeswoman and representative Sarah Brady pushed for the legislation of HR 1022 with the Law Enforcement protection act in 2007 without even knowing what some of the things she was trying to have banned do. This was most emphasized in her video here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rGpykAX1fo  She outright lied saying that the original assault weapons ban was a ban on weapons most used to kill our officers when in actuality the weapons banned turned up in less than 2% of all violent crimes involving guns.She also mentioned large capacity clips- which do not exist, but large capacity magazines do.but then when directly asked what barrel shrouds are, and their function, and after 3 unsuccessful dodges, she admitted she had no idea. How could we, the gun community ever expect anything reasonable to come from an organization which has representatives that do not even understand their own position and proposed legislation?Also Paul Helmke, president of the  Brady Campaign, is the same gentleman that started a fundraiser on their website the day after the Virginia Tech Massacre. He is a man of no moral compass who has used tragedy to further his personal agenda and line his own pockets."
2,the only middle ground that the brady bunch agrees with is total and complete disarmament. criminals will always find guns! the only hope is to jail repeat offenders and keep them off the streets! punishing legal working class gun owners by confiscation will only create a bigger problem.  England pretty much disarmed their citizens and crime has skyrocketed! you are not allowed to defend yourself and are at the mercy of any criminals element. only concealed carry in 38 states allowed the crime rate to drop 20 to 30 percent. I think down deep your a boob and are afraid of guns.  where I live it takes a half and hour to get a cop to your house. if you dont defend yourself you will be history.
2,"Gun owners have compromised away most of our rights. More than 20,000 gun laws nation wide and bad people are still killing innocent people. If we were really allowed to defend ourselves (all things being equal, assuming the use of deadly force to be determined to be lawful and justified) without fear of prosecution and civil suit, perhaps we could reduce the number of criminals, especially those with illegal guns. The fact is, many law-abiding gun owners fear using a gun to defend life and family that they don't do it. Think about your community of criminals KNEW that EVERYONE except them were disarmed. Additionally, WTSHTF and we are faced with TEOTWAWKI and criminals are not detered by the police, we must be our own last line of defense."
2,"I cannot imagine what their motives might be.  Perhaps some are honestly fearful, but the sordid history of weapons control indicates that restricting weapons to some favored groups or to the state causes more bloodshed than it prevents."
2,"Given the history of tyrants in the past century, I would hesitate to restrict any citizen's ability to buy any weapon they can afford.  Perhaps anti-armor rockets should have a unique identifier, but bad things happen when armed revolt is impossible."
2,"If you do an internet search on the Brady Bunch you will find that they do advovate totally disarming the entire population. There are probably a number of reasons for this so just consider this one possibility: the belief in a utopian society. I am always concerned when people push Utopia. It is unattainable except at the cost of the people. I would not care to live in the sterile environment of such a society in which freedom lost is the cost. Further, consider who the allies of the Brady Bunch are: DiFi, Carolyn McCarthy, Chuck U Schumer, et al. Research their anti-gun positions."
2,"Let me be brutally honest, I have no respect for anyone attempting to disarm the law-abiding population of this country. Further, I am not a proponent of rational informed discourse, at least not as you see it. I dispise these people. I will no longer tolerate compromise with them or anyone like them. My fight is for liberty and against tyranny. I cannot be courteous to the Brady Bunch (a term I coined, by the way. Arrogant, ain't I?). However, if you decide not to consider my arguement because you consider me to be discourteous that is up to you. The truth about the Brady Bunch is there for you to see. I have come to the conclusion that one cannot change another person's opinion or point of view if there are not open minded in the first place. But, I still feel compelled to set forth my position whether you are convinced or not.The fact remains that these people are deceptive and are determined to disarm us incrementally. Check for yourself. Every time they manage to get some oppressive, Draconian anti-gun law passed, they always say that this is only a first step in removing firearms from private ownership. This must not be allowed to happen.Try this:   http://www.bradycampaign.org/blog  /O bama has not consistantly supported the Second Amendment. Look into his time in the Illinoise State Senate and you see that not to be true. Therefore, Paul Helmke of the Brady Bunch is lying. He is a liar. How can you ever trust anyone who lies?Helmke says: ""As Sen. Obama said in his speech accepting the Democratic nomination, ""The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don’t tell me we can’t uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.""The way they do this is to make semi-auto rifles illegal to own, possess, use, etc."
2,"Adam-The reason we feel the Brady Campaign is pushing for total disarmament is this (forgive me I'm going to give a number of links and explanations):  http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/faqs/?page=sns  note the above first- the brady campaign seeker tighter regulation of the firearms industry with regards to safety. Outwardly it seems like a very reasonable policy, make safe tools for people to use safely. No one would be against such a thing.However, these regulations are already in place, things like transfer bar safeties, drop test requirements, and a variety of other safety features are included in all firearms of modern manufacture. the firearm described by the Brady campaign in that section, with shorter barrel lengths, is actually THE IDEAL handgun for self defense because they lend themselves to actually being carried. eliminating guns with barrel lengths under 3 in eliminates the compact auto and compact revolver market- driving several gun manufacturers completely out of business; despite the fact that their products are very accurate, safe, and useful.I'm not sure if I'm making my point clear, but they are not pushing for the elimination of junk guns, but the total elimination of a style of extremely useful defensive gun utilized heavily by private citizens.then lets look at the assault weapons ban  http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/faqs/?page=awb  besides a number of bans by name, the parameters for the ban eliminate a number of other guns as well. Handguns over 50 oz for instance eliminate a number of excellent hunting pistols (mine included) most importantly however, they ban a number of guns that really aren't used in crimes. In my original post some ways up the 1994 AWB stopped citizens from buying guns that were involved in less than 2% of gun related crimes. NONE of which are easily converted to full auto, despite what the Brady Campaign will say.They also put up wildly inaccurate information. if you look under assault rifles vs hunting rifles, where 'assault rifles are meant to be spray fired from the hip' that is a totally made up assessment. No 'assault rifle' (which for the most part are not available to citizens because a true assault rifle is fully automatic, so already they are dishonest with their naming) is intended to be used in such an inaccurate manner. Ask any military friend what happened if they tried to fire their m16 from the hip. I bet their Drill Instructor gave them a verbal berating they wouldn't soon forget.Also- the difference between a hunting rifle and a assault rifle by their definition, is the stock, magazine, and in some ways the barrel configuration. All of these are readily changeable parts on a firearm. This allows the Brady Campaign to ban hunting rifles just by saying they can be easily converted to assault rifles- allowing them to extend their ban to eliminate virtually all semi-automatic weapons.People can talk about legitimate sporting purposes all they want, but the fact is, I own a number of military style weapons, both rifles and handguns, and am completely safe. To limit my rights on strawman arguments against crimes that frankly have not occurred is a complete disservice to me as a citizen.  http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/faqs/?page=second  above note the dreaded 'gunshow' loophole.I'll be brief with this section as it is so fraught with error it is insulting to have listed such a thing as fact. To say that a full quarter of gunshow tables do not have gun licenses may be accurate, simply because there are easily that many tables at a gun show NOT selling guns of any sort."
2,"Private citizens can access the NICS background system if they are a firearms collector, and you can refuse sale to any private person if you have the slightest suspicion they are in anyway dishonest. I have done a number of these 'dastardly private transactions' and I can say with 100% certainty that in my experience, this 'loophole' is non-existent. records are still always kept by both sides, usually a copy of a drivers license at the minimum, and often, if one party has any kind of status to call in background checks they do so on behalf of both parties to keep everyone happy and safe.Further- in many states the private sale of handguns is regulated so that even if you want to sell a firearm privately, you still must do so at the pistol licensing authority, in the local sheriff dept, transferring serial number locks, and other required bits of information. The Brady Campaign completely ignores that fact.  http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/faqs/?page=licreg  this is a final point about registration. Much of what they propose already happens, and much of what the rest of they propose here is meant to increase the cost of firearm ownership to the point as to price much of the middle class out of the market. (the lower class, as a result of regulations like this have already been priced out in many areas)The Brady Campaign has softened their outward exterior in an attempt to gain favor with the public. They were too extreme with their views in the 90s; however the people have not changed, nor has their mission. They just repackaged themselves in an attempt to confuse and mislead people into following their agenda.sorry it took so long to respond, your arguments are valid and deserved an adequate response."
2,"A handgun is uniquely valuable in self defense in one's home U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled, ""Essentially, the appellants claim a right to possess what they describe as 'functional firearms', by which they mean ones that could be 'readily accessible to be used effectively when necessary' for self-defense in the home. They are not asserting a right to carry such weapons outside their homes. Nor are they challenging the District's authority per se to require the registration of firearms.""[3]
"
2,"Need a motive-- Many of the antigunners have a frank clinical phobia about firearms in the same way others are phobic about heights, snakes,  etc..  Difference is that the latter phobics would get laughed at for attempting to legislate their phobia."
2,"I'm a physician.  I know a phobia when I see one...Merck Manual on-line:"" Phobic disorders consist of persistent, unreasonable, intense fears (phobias) of situations, circumstances, or objects. The fears provoke anxiety and avoidance."""" Specific phobias are the most common anxiety disorders......Specific phobias affect about 13% of women and 4% of men during any 12-mo period.... Phobia of blood (hemophobia), injections (trypanophobia), needles or other sharp objects (belonephobia), or injury (traumatophobia) occurs to some degree in at least 5% of the population. ""NB:  I suspect many rabid antigunners have some variation of traumatophobia.""The prognosis for specific phobias is more variable when untreated because it may be easy to avoid the situation or object that causes fear and anxiety.Or alternately-- pass a law against it..."
2,"Most psych diagnoses are made on the basis of what you get told.  I.e.,  strictly speaking you don't necessarily need to see the patient.  The seemingly irrational behavior and pronouncments of many antigunners tells me plenty.BTW,  a phobia is a ""neurosis"",  i.e.,  a fairly low-grade psych disorder.   Object phobias tend to develop to potentially harmful objects or situations.  If people can develop phobias to stuff like heights,  needles,  knives,  etc.,  it is reasonable they can develop them to firearms.   As noted above,  object phobias are quite common.  Are you asserting that antigunners are spared them?   Anyway,  a high incidence of object phobia to guns explains a lot.   For one thing,  it explains why we gunners keep making deals and then get screwed.  A person with an object phobia may go to extraordinary lengths to abolish the object.BTW,  one source of object phobias is that the object reminds the phobic of unpleasant supressed thoughts and feelings.  E.g.,  someone with difficulty handling aggressive impulses may develop an object phobia to knives,  guns, etc. as a purely defensive measure.  Same with people who have suicidal thoughts who develop a phobia to guns because of them.   Winston Churchill had endogenous depression and admitted to a fear of heights because of it.   BTW,  note I say only ""some"" antigunners have an object phobia to guns.  Many of the rest are the usual busybody doo-gooders, friady-cats, and/or people on a mission from God.  Don't forget the ones trying to achieve closure.   ""My husband was killed by a madman with a gun,  so I'm going to bring meaning to it by prohibiting guns"", etc.  Too bad if this means trampling on the rights of people who do no harm.Similarly,  an unknown number of antigunners are standard-issue racists who just want to keep firearms out of the hands of lesser, more highly-melanized breeds.   Where our ancestors would just use the ""N-word"",  these folks use euphonisms like ""inner city"" and ""youth violence"".   But we all know what they mean."
2,"The days of people truly needing guns in their everyday lives to protect themselves from predatory animals are gone, at least in the vast majority of the United States (even Montana)  Predatory people, on the other hand, are something else entirely.  Nowhere do law abiding citizens need guns more than in poor urban communities rocked by gang violence.  Gangsters do not follow the laws, nor do they get their guns legally.  Those who intend to use their guns for less-than-legal purposes will aquire them in less-than-legal ways.  The only way to insure that the common man can bring the same firepower as a hardened ganster to the fight at his front door is to lift firearm restrictions.  Gangsters are not the only predatory people out there, however.  In the Declaration of Independence, it is written, ""That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.""  The Second Amendment was written to insure that should this country come to such dire straits, the people would be able to fight back.  It is for that reason that any and all restrictions on the Constitutional right to bear arms are unacceptable.  It was the intention of the Founding Fathers for citizens to possess military-grade weapons to prevent the government from overstepping its bounds.  The Supreme Court is NOT the last word against tyranny, it is an educated and well-armed populace.  That is what firearms (and arms in general, as technology advances) mean in America.  "
1,"Talk about the intentions of the founding fathers is all very well. However, the collateral damage of American gun culture is such that reasonable people want to do something to reduce the damage. I am surprised that the idea of restricting firearms causes such anger. "
2,"I realize that you don't much care for the Constitution and the basis for American life over in Australia, but the question is about the USA, and they are an important part of what it means to be Free here.  About the collateral damage, I don't see what you're talking about.  Gang violence is an entirely different beast than the culture of armed, law-abiding citizens.  True American gun culture puts a gun in the hand of a single mother defending her home from an intruder, in the hand of a young woman who would otherwise be raped, in the hands of a minority fending off an angry mob, and in the hands of freedom loving citizen standing in the face of tyranny.  It is this group of gun owners that regulation will harm, not the horrific perversion of gangsters, drug lords, and the disturbed, who generally acquire their guns illegally anyway.  Legal firearms are the best defense against these pervesions, not restrictions that will leave them easy prey."
1,"It's one thing to fantasize about law abiding citizens holding back the threat of intruders, rapists, angry mobs and tyrants. it may be comforting to imagine that restrictions on guns will only inconvenience the law abiding. Even if all this is true, America appears to pay a heavy price for this position on guns. Here are some comparative figures in gun-related deaths in various countries:The United States accounted for 45 percent of the 88,649 gun deaths reported in the study, the first comprehensive international scrutiny of gun-related deaths.The gun-related deaths per 100,000 people in 1994 by country were as follows:U.S.A. 14.24Northern Ireland 6.63Finland 6.46Switzerland 5.31France 5.15Canada 4.31Norway 3.82Austria 3.70Portugal 3.20Israel 2.91Belgium 2.90Australia 2.65Slovenia 2.60Italy 2.44New Zealand 2.38Denmark 2.09Sweden 1.92Kuwait 1.84Greece 1.29Germany 1.24Hungary 1.11Ireland 0.97Spain 0.78Netherlands 0.70Scotland 0.54England and Wales 0.41Taiwan 0.37Singapore 0.21Mauritius 0.19Hong Kong 0.14South Korea 0.12Japan 0.05My source:   http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6166  Canada has less than a third of the per capita gun related deaths of the United States. Australia has less than a fifth of the per capita gun related deaths of the United States.England and Wales have less than a thirtieth of the per capita gun related deaths of the United StatesSo the United States bears a great burden from those extra gun related deaths"
2,"There is a difference between a gun death and a gun crime.  If an innocent woman is raped, there is neither gun death nor gun crime.  If an innocent woman defends herself from a would-be rapist with a firearm, you have a gun death, but not a gun crime.  If a gangbanger shoots somebody for their shoes, you now have a gun death and a gun crime.  Gun deaths are not a good way to show the ""collateral damage"" of the evil ""American gun culture,"" because, quite frankly, I don't care if a rapist gets shot.  In fact, it makes me glad to know that he is not going to hurt anyone else.  It would be interesting to see a similar study on gun crime, as opposed to gun deaths, and also on crime in general.  There is not better reason not to break into a house than that the owner could be home and armed."
1,"I checked out some comparative crime rates by country. In other crimes the United States didn't fare too well, but they were not as outstanding as they were with gun deaths. So it seems that only in gun deaths does the United States really stand out."
2,"Australia banned firearms in March of 2000 and guess what happened crime went up. Weird. Here are the stats:  Crime rose after a sweeping ban on private gun ownership. In the first two years after gun-owners were forced to surrender 640,381 personal firearms, government statistics show a dramatic increase in criminal activity.353354 In 2001-2002, homicides were up another 20%.according to Australian Institute of Criminology, “Report #46: Homicide in Australia, 2001-2002"", April 2003From the inception of firearm confiscation to March 27, 2000, the numbers are:• Gun murders up 19%• Armed robbery up 69%• Home invasions up 21%The sad part is that in the 15 years before national gun confiscation:• Firearm-related homicides dropped nearly 66%.• Firearm-related deaths fell 50%. Gun crimes are rising throughout Australia after guns were banned. In Sydney alone, robbery rates with guns rose 160% in 2001, more in the previous year.according to The Sydney Morning Herald, “Costa targets armed robbers”, April 4, 2002 A ten year study that concluded Australian firearm confiscation had no effect on crime rates.According to ""Gun Laws and Sudden Death: Did the Australian Firearms Legislation of 1996 Make a Difference?"", Dr. Jeanine Baker and Dr. Samara McPhedran, British Journal of Criminology, November 2006.So as you can see we want to ban guns too because it worked out so well in Australia. Also concerning your claim that there are 39892 gun deaths in the US in 1994 according to your 45% of the total stat. According to the FBI website there were only 16,305 murders in 1994. Wow that takes that number down quite a bit, the rest are suicides the estimate from the department of Justice is about 54% that's 21,541 so that leaves 2,046 deaths attributed to unintentional, and undetermined reasons. So taking out just suicides (studies have shown rates don't change with or without guns present so these people would kill themselves anyways), that leaves 18,351 gun deaths in 1994. That's brings it down to 6.55 per 100,000. We can even go lower also according to the FBI in the early 90's approximately 5,000 of the murders a year were committed by people on parole or had an early release for felonies that brings it down to 4.77 because as we all know it is illegal for felons to have guns and as they have proved before they always follow the law not to mention a lot of them got out early and committed another violent crime. Also according to the Department of Justice the homicide rate in 1994 for non-gun deaths was 3.1 wow that still puts us in the top ten on your chart. Also the US isn't even in the Top 10 for homicides in a country according to the UN Office on Drug and Crime from 1998-2000.I could sit on here and give facts and stats all day long but I doubt that would ever change your mind. It all comes down to the fact that more people die from diseases, car wrecks from drunk driving incidents than are killed my guns in a year. Last I checked cancer doesn't save any lives so why not focus the money/time/effort on a bigger problem and leave our one true way to defend ourselves alone. "
1," The Second Amendment applies to militia's, not private ownership. ""Since the Second Amendment right 'to keep and bear arms' applies only to the right of the state to maintain a militia, and not to the individual's right to bear arms, there can be no serious claim to any express constitutional right of an individual to possess a firearm,"" (Stevens v. United States).

2," DC's handgun ban threatens citizens' ability to defend themselves on the streets The majority of violent encounters occur on the street, versus in the home. Hand guns are a particularly important means to protecting one self on the street. This is primarily the case because handguns can be easily carried by law-abiding civilians, and concealed so as to avoid scaring other citizens. Shotguns and rifles do not share these characteristics.   
"
2,"While examining these figures, one must not neglect to consider the unique demographics that we have in the United States. Please don't interpret this as racist . . . I'm just trying to make a point: If all black crimes were taken out of these figures then the United States would have one of the LOWEST rates of gun violence. Anyone who has studied statistics on even a master's level knows that you have to adjust for these things in order to formulate a conclusion so this point is very salient."
1,"What evidence do you have that black crimes were taken out of the gun violence figures, the United States would have one of the lowest rates of gun violence? Here is evidence of gun deaths in a number of countries:The gun-related deaths per 100,000 people in 1994 by country were as follows:U.S.A. 14.24Northern Ireland 6.63Finland 6.46Switzerland 5.31France 5.15Canada 4.31Norway 3.82Austria 3.70Portugal 3.20Israel 2.91Belgium 2.90Australia 2.65Slovenia 2.60Italy 2.44New Zealand 2.38Denmark 2.09Sweden 1.92Kuwait 1.84Greece 1.29Germany 1.24Hungary 1.11Ireland 0.97Spain 0.78Netherlands 0.70Scotland 0.54England and Wales 0.41Taiwan 0.37Singapore 0.21Mauritius 0.19Hong Kong 0.14South Korea 0.12Japan 0.05My source:   http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6166   Now where is your source to back up your claim?"
2,"Apples and oranges.   The US is a pretty diverse place. Gun violence here tends to be confined to specific cultural groups that flatly don't exist in most other places.   How many inner city black gangs do you-all have in Australia?  E.g., roughly half of all US murders are committed by blacks,  who represent 14% of the population.  Of this,  the predominant part is committed by inner minority city males between 17-35 years of age,  about 4% of the population.  Much is related to the drug trade. Hispanics and rural white southerners are also disproportionately represented.  The unifying factor seems to be an ""Honor culture"",  where interpersonal disputes are traditionally resolved by violence.   It is not particularly related to the presence or absence of firearms,  which may actually be scarce overall in high crime areas.  If memory serves,  the murder rates among Americans of European descent tends to resemble that of where their ancestors immigrated from.  "
1,"You have made an interesting argument, but you haven't backed it up with any credible source. Remember that the US is not the only multicultural country. But let's say your figures were right, and 86% of the people were responsible for half the gun deaths. That still wouldn't bring down the non-black US gun death rate to the gun death rate of Northern Ireland. So even if your figures were right, and you have supplied no evidence to show that they are right, they don't explain away the statistics."
2,"Look up ""National   crime   report"" on google.  I don't have time or inclination to get them.  But nobody seems to argue with them.The average Brit (or aussie) being more civilized than us free-range Americans,  the UK has always had a low   murder   rate,    guns   or not.   In fact,  around 1900,  all you had to do was pay a 10 shilling   tax   to carry concealed. Yet the murder rate was lower than now.  The book ""Against the Odds"" (look it up) notes that even in the mid 1600's london had only a dozen murders or less a year,  compared to one a day or so for Paris.The sociologists tell us the the main varible in the white non-hispanic US murder rate is to be of southern US extraction,  which I am,  partly.  Look up ( Virginia senator ) James Webb's book on us,  aptly-entitled ""Born fighting"".   An honor culture again.  Don't mess with 'em.OTOH,  my Danish-  immigrant   ancestors up north  universally own   firearms  .  It's a farm tool like any other.  Flatly-stated,  they just don't shoot each other.   "
2,"My favorite example of how   murder   rates are culturally-set is the six ""Founding Fathers"" pictured on US currency.  As with inner city minorities now,  they had a dueling culture.Thus,  ex-US vice   president   Aaron Burr killed  ex US-treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton ($10 bill), in a duel.  Similarly,  US President Andrew Jackson ($20 bill ) killed at least one man in a duel,  perhaps more.  All with   guns  ,  naturally.These days,  high-level US politicians no longer kill each other.  So there is hope for us all yet."
2,"Sorry buddy. I googled your referance and found '0', nothing, nada, of your stats as stated. therefore what you say must be a lie. google GUN FACTS or GUN FACTS 4.0 or GUN FACTS 5.0 and get the REAL facts that are documented on every page. check these government sources out which are all public record. they disagree completely with everything you have put in your article. people if you want truth you must frequent where truth is told.

I do not like killing people and will not if i can get out of it. however if you prey on my sheep, I WILL KILL YOU IF, NECESSARY, TO MAKE YOU STOP. My dear sheep. Yes, I have fangs just like a wolf. Yes I am very capable of violence just like a wolf. However, just like you mr. or mrs. sheep, i cannot hurt a sheep except like you it is an accident. just like you an accident would devistate me. In reality I am a sheep with different abilities, some inherant and some acquired. I am a sheep dog both because i wish to be and because i cannot help myself. wolves are my enemy just as they are yours. i am your only defense. Do not pull my teeth. if you do we will all die. i will stilldo what i can to protect my sheep and indeed i will die doing just that just as many of us sheep dogs have died useing our teeth to protect you. without teeth we will just die trying and failing. get rid of the stupidity that the anti gun people have spoon fed you all these years. that stupidity will kill you.

2,"You can count me in as one of the well-armed populace, and if the gun and ammo sales in the last 6-8 months is any indication there are a lot of us.  More than 5 Billion rounds of ammunition sold, and more   guns   sold in the period since the   election  .  That's more than was sold during the previous two years combined, if the gun blogs are accurate."
2,"The numbers of   guns   in the United States vastly outnumber the population of the country (300 million).  I am shocked to read news   headlines   mentioning the incidents involving young people and handguns. Nowadays it's not uncommon to read about   teens   killing other teens and adults in gang shootings, robberies gone bad, carjackings, or botched drug deals.   The recent-history murders of   church   officials around the country and   college  -campus massacres of innocent people should serve as a reminder that gun violence in the hands of unstable people has gone too far, and government must do something to at least cut back on this pandemic before it consumes all of us.  I believe that the Second Amendment of the   U.S. Constitution   is not a carte blanche to allow anyone uncontrolled access and use to   firearms  , but rather is a protective measure to ensure the protection of citizens during times of war at home.  In other words, I do not believe that the Constitution writers would have allowed unstable or questionable persons to have access to these weapons of mass destruction.  And neither should we.  "
1,"So now we're asked to believe that having students on campus with guns will make campus life safer?  Hey, isn't the Tooth Fairy real?Aren't campuses those places where young adults regularly get drunk playing beer pong?  Where students often experiment with drugs for the first time?  These would mix wonderfully with guns don't you think?"
2," 2nd Amendment conferred a right to defend against various historical threats. Self-defense was a very likely element of the Framers' thinking behind the second amendment. It conferred the right to bear arms for the sake of defending against wolves and bears. It also conferred the right to bear arms for the sake of defending against Indians. Additionally, concerns regarding crime and insecurity were very high in the uncertain first years of the Union, making it likely that the 2nd amendment was also intended by the framers to confer a right to protect against criminals. 
"
2,"when was the last time you played beer pong in class.I want the ability to defend myself in a dangerus situation.right now no one is safe and for some reason the ignorant feel safe.last time I checked this wasnt a debate about gun ownership, its about carrying, im a gun owner already i want the ability to use a gun (a tool) in order to protect myself if i need to.  This is not a debate whatsoever about who can have guns only where they can carrythem"
1,"yes...allowing the youth of america to posess guns, knives, ...perhaps grenades, bombs, etc....is a great way to keep colleges safe!!!! is this for real??? my obvious answer to this question is absolutley not....and if i were a parent and heard that this was allowed...you bet id be knocking on the deans door.....wearing a bullet proof vest of course!"
2,"1) grenades and bombs are federally regulated. besides, none of the college shootings featured explosive devices.2) certain youths already possess firearms - legal age to purchase rifles and shotguns in most states is 18.3) to obtain a concealed weapons permit in most states, one has to be 21. if i'm not mistaken the legal definition of an adult is 18+ years of age."
2,"A gun permit has nothing to do with grenades, bombs etc. . . . lets be real.  If you are licensed and trusted to carry everywhere else in the state what is special about a school?  Either you can be trusted and pass the background check or you don't.  There is nothing magic about crossing a line onto school property that will suddenly make a licensed gun owner less responsible than he/she was off of school property.This is just another feel good rule that is costing lives again. .  ."
2,"Grenades and bombs are not allowed to be owned by private people.This is not about who has   guns  , it is about where licensed carriers have guns. They carry responsibly off   campus   practically everywhere they go from restaurants, churches, movie theaters, and shopping malls. What makes college campuses so special that makes licensed carriers irresponsible the moment they cross the magical line that separates the campus from the rest of   society  ?"
2,"It is not an easy feat to be allowed a concealed weapon.  You have to be 21 years of age, go through and extensive background check, as well as other things.  Students that are too busy getting high and drinking are not going to get guns because they wouldn't be able to pass these tests.  Good people, trustworthy people, would be the ones with guns, not the idiots.  If I was in class and someone came in to shoot everyone, I would love to know that my teacher or a student that is qualified to carry a gun can save my life and I'm sure my parents would be just as glad.  If you're a parent and you think that guns on campuses are a bad thing then you should do some more research.  See what happens when a gunman brings an AK-47 to your child's classroom and then tell me that you wouldn't like a good citizen in the room with the ability to save your child's life.  "
1,a drunk kid with a permit will get in an argument with another kid at a party and shoot them. The idea that only the most trustworthy and responsible will get permits is wishful thinking.
2,"""a drunk kid with a permit .. at a party""First off, the folks that would be allowed to carry on campus would be the ones that are LICENSED to do so. They ALREADY carry these firearms.We dont hear about these students ""shooting"" other students at parties... Allowing students to carry on campus would just allow them to walk across the campus line with their firearm that they ALREADY carry virtually everywhere else.We are talking about concealed carry in a CLASSROOM environment.We dont hear about Students that are licensed to carry, shooting up parties off campus. Why would these 21+ year olds start opening fire at those same parties when the only thing that would change is the allowance to carry IN CLASS."
2,"First off their are no kids involved only adults.second those adults already carry everywhere else in life without a drunken incident.you may also wish to concider the type of student that would go threw the time to get training.  the cost of a weapon, holster, the cost of training, the fees to the state for the permit, the hoops they have to jump thew to be in compliance with the law, the finger printing and backround checks.i dont have to tell you that those individuals are not the regular old pot head binge drinker steriotype you make all students out to be.---another thing to think about is students that are unable to defend themselfs agianst attack.  people like disabled students, women, and anyone else that is either to small or weak to be effective in their defence.but i guess its better to just get rid of the idea because one person may be irresponsible, even though to date it has never happend anywhere campus carry is allowd."

2,"Handguns are particularly needed for self-defense in a crime-ridden DC. Handguns are most needed for self-defense in the hands of citizens that are under the most threat, such as in DC's crime-ridden streets. A ban on handguns in DC is contrary to this logic.

Their argument is based purely on fear and ignorance while the REALITY is that it is not the case. FBI statistics show that   concealed carry   contributes to an overall reduction in   crime  . One is statistics, the other is propaganda. Please don't confuse the two."
2,"I read somewhere on here:'A student will get drunk, get into a fight and shoot someone.'That's some sharp logic there, Hawking. How about being a little more open minded? Consider a few things, if you will:-What responsible gun owner would bring his weapon to a keg party?-A majority of legal gun owners are smart people. In other words, NOT STUPID. They're not going to whip out their guns and wave them around with the safety lock off. Most legal gun owners have acquired their weapons legally BECAUSE they have the training to show for it, and are psychologically sound individuals who have the ability to stay calm and level-headed in a time of crisis. -In case you haven't noticed, gang members don't bother leveling and shooting. They run around blindly shooting without looking. And you wonder why innocent people get hit by stray bullets. -Did you ever consider the many people whose lives have been saved because they happened to have a gun? A would-be thief is not going to mess with you if you've got your gun trained on him. Hear of the 85-year-old woman who held a gun on a burglar and made him call the police? She could have been injured or killed had she been unarmed.-Virginia Tech -- had there been a student or teacher on campus who had had a gun, they might have been able to stop the killer. But no, everyone had to wait for 33 people to be shot before 'help' arrived. Last but not least, consider the 2nd amendment, which protects the individual's right to own a gun. And in case you people didn't know, the 2nd amendment is an integral part of our Constitution. Ban weapons and you've got millions of law-abiding citizens (aka sitting ducks) for all the country's vicious gang members and general scum of society to terrorize while the government lays down thousands more laws to restrict the populace. "
2,"The overwhelming majority of negative comments on this topic are initial knee-jerk reactions by people that have not been exposed to the facts yet. How do i know? because the concerns have already been adressed in the FAQ sections of every concealed carry website on the internet. This is about ADULTS who ALREADY HAVE PERMITS TO CARRY outside the confines of the campus and DO SO ON A DAILY BASIS without incident. These people are the most law abiding citizens out there, who take care in what they do every day because they understand that thier RIGHT to keep and bear arms is also a responsibility that is not to be taken lightly. The arguments from people that understand the basic facts have progressed towards things like caliber selection, additional training requirements, and how to prevent theft; NOT whether college students will get drunk and shoot thier professor. "
2,"When you need one you need one, those that are licensed & of age should not be barred from carrying on campus"
1,"My ""no"" response is related to guns and any other body-harming weapon used specifically as defensive weapons. I'm quite in favor of individual defensive devices of some sort - stun guns, tasers, pepper sprays, etc. - insofar as these weapons can theoretically neutralize a perpetrator without permanent damage. I certainly understand the history of weapon carrying and do not have specific criticism of it. It is simply my preference that a dangerous assailant be neutralized - if at all possible - without causing them permanent harm. I believe there is a better way of controlling violence - armed or unarmed - without the injuries inherent to guns and knives or other like tools. It seems to me these alternate devices are at least a hint at substitutes. Certainly others can be developed. It always seems preferable to defend oneself in a way befitting of one who believes there is no place for physical violence in a civilized culture. The nature of guns and other dangerous tools used even for defensive purposes seems to contradict the spirit of such a society. If we cannot show compassion toward our violent assailants, what right have we to the claim of civility?In any event, I fully support the right of a voting american to own and carry a firearm regardless of the lethality issues. It is a guaranteed liberty, but I would hope the majority of americans would choose a non-violent path when practical."
2,"Trying to ""neutralize"" someone who is trying to kill you without hurting them is idiotic, and so is advocating it.Think of it this way: You're sitting in a classroom, or office, or cubicle, whatever you'd like to imagine. Someone walks in with a gun and starts shooting people. Which of these would you want to have in your pocket? A gun, a Taser (keep in mind, the types that actually shoot out electrodes often cost more than a quality handgun), or pepper spray? Obviously, two of these aren't guaranteed to work and one of them requires you to carefully aim at someone who's probably 20 or so feet away. Assuming you have the Taser that shoots electrodes, you have one, or sometimes two, shots before you reload. A Glock 19 will give you 15 shots and nobody can shake off new holes being put in them.Keep in mind, this guy will kill you unless you intervene. The idea of concealed carrying is that you're only going to use it if you think someone is going to kill you. When someone is trying to kill you, you don't want to mess around with Tasers or pepper spray - you want to kill him. Saying ""well, I don't want to hurt anyone!"" is nice on paper, but you don't want to fuck around if somebody is shooting at you. "
1,"I see your point, certainly, however, whether you neutralize the assailant by killing them or otherwise making it physically impossible for them to cause harm to others, neutralization is the point in any violent attack. I agree the Glock has the potential to neutralize their threat quite nicely, however, when given the choice of killing or not killing, is it your choice to kill simply because it's quick and easy to do so? Are we to kill our attackers because killing them is the most convenient approach?I'm saying only that all life - threatening to us or not - is precious and we ought not be so casual in the taking of it. In a violent attack upon our person or property, our main goal is to end the violent attack. We can do so by any means possible without regard for any life but our own, or we can put an end to violence in an intelligent way that preserves not only our own life but the life of one's attacker.In any violent event, you can fight savagery with more savagery or with intelligence. I'm saying we ought to choose an intelligent end to violence rather than fall to the very savagery threatening us. By doing so, we in fact advocate the very thing we wish to defend ourselves against. If we truly abhor savagery, let us not be savages to make our point.I thoroughly disagree with the notion of fighting fire with fire. I firmly believe in fighting fire with intelligence. A gun is the lazy brute's way out. You may stop your assailant from further harming you but, you lose all the same."
2,"You're thinking about it wrong. I'm not advocating blowing away everyone who might be threatening. If someone can be brought down without permanently hurting them, while also keeping the person who is being threatened safe, that's fine by me. I'm not advocating the police blowing away every whackjob with a knife or a pipe. What I am saying is that if someone has a gun, and is threatening to shoot someone with it, or has already shot someone, trying to use less-than-lethal methods to neutralize him isn't a good idea. To put it simply, a gun is the best way to make bad guys go away. There is no room to be fumbling with a beanbag shotgun when someone is executing people. Take Virginia Tech for example. The shooter was going from classroom to classroom shooting people, ""execution-style"", as the media likes to call it. In this case, trying to get rid of him without hurting or killing him would just allow him to kill more people, while the police try to taser him. Back to the self-defense issue - pepper spray and tasers are for the drunk guy from the bar getting a little too friendly. Not for people who are trying to kill you. Again, I'm not advocating replacing pepper spray with a gun. Pepper spray has it's purpose - and so does a gun. If someone is trying to kill you, you want to get rid of the threat as quickly as possible. Less-lethal options will never be as effective as a gun for this purpose. My main point is that while we should always value human life, we shouldn't be so caught up with it that we allow others, or ourselves, to harmed as a result of our inability to take decisive action. "
2,"There is a reason the Army uses guns. . . they deal with folks trying to kill them.  Peper spray and almost anything else ""non lethal"" is questionable at best as to if it will work.  If they attacker is high on something I almost guarantee it won't work.  Tasers are great but one shot maybe two. . . not good if my life is on the line - cops don't even use them if it is life or death.  Naumadd I wish we lived in a world your ideas would work in but we don't.  I have spent years learning Karate and if attacked and in fear of my life I still would rather have a gun to fall back on.  Only a gun let you deal with the bigger guy, the guy attacking a small woman, drug crazed, the armed attacker or the multiple attacker issue.  It also lets you stay out of reach of his knife or other weapon.  If I am in fear of my life there is no reason I should be forced to use anything less effective than a gun and risk further injury or death because what I use didn't stop the guy.  For now guns are the best we have.  Until something better comes along and we all get to set our phasors on stun then we should be allowed to have a gun if we pass the legal tests to do so."
1,"An individual right to bear arms cannot be absolute No individual rights are absolute. The right to free speech is not absolute. Libel, slander, and hate crime laws are examples of reasonable restrictions on this right. Similar restrictions can be placed on the right to bear arms. So, even if there is an individual right to bear arms, it is possible to consider the limited ban on handguns in DC as a reasonable restriction of this right.

2,"""... when given the choice of killing or not killing, is it your choice to kill simply because its quick and easy to do so?...""Any situation which legally and morally requires the use of a firearm is by definition a situation of desperation and last resort. I note that this situation of last resort was created and forced up one or more by an aggressor who is *at that moment* employing deadly force against one or more individuals, who played absolutely no part in this situation of desperation other than merely being there.Now, having said that, there are always one or more factors which must be considered before you, the defender, even draws a weapon.  The 'intelligent' action is that which fits the situation: education, training and calmness under (major) stress are what let you choose your path through a situation in which people have been murdered with very probably more to follow.""...or we can put an end to violence in an intelligent way that preserves not only our own life but the life of one's attacker...""There are those who will not engage in any form of dialogue.

In terms of responsibility and duty, carrying a firearm is every bit as weighty as having a family.  Your every action has to be weighed and considered in terms of effects on others.Before you decide to acquire a firearm, look inside yourself.  If you truly believe that should the most awful happen, you won't use it, then don't get one.  You will only give it to a *really* bad person."
2,"I was about to commend you for being one of the only no arguments that offered a calm, thought out statement.

And there are those of us who would be happy to do what you are unwilling or unable to do, remove that person from our society.To me the most intelligent choice is to arm myself equally or more than anyone who might choose to do harm to me or my loved ones.  This is not lazy or brutish.  And beyond all of this your ""all life is precious"" argument falls flat in the fact that you support a government who murders millions of innocents through collateral damge around the world fighting unjust wars.But the real issue is deterence.

Your assertion of ""intellegent response"" will get you killed.The majority of carry permit holders train more than the majority of   police   officers and, in my experience, are, by far, more accurate and less likely to endanger bystanders."
2,"The real crux of the matter is the intent of the perpetrator.  It doesn't matter what tool he or she uses to murder, that tool is one hundred percent activated by an individual who is completely determined to murder innocent people: without regard to the individual, family, position in the community or accomplishments. The perpetrator *will* do his best to murder.""... I believe there is a better way of controlling violence - armed or unarmed - without the injuries inherent to guns and knives or other like tools...""In the quiet calm of a home, study, seminar or classroom it is logically impossible to argue against the above quote in any reasonable manner.  Yet, in real life, an individual who is completely focused on murder rarely presents an opportunity for someone to neutralize that individual with something less than deadly force coupled with sudden action; powered by a singular intent.  As of this time, there is not an effective non-violent method or tool available which is relatively inexpensive and available to the public for immediate self protection.  When those become available, then, perhaps, differing methods can be employed.""...If we cannot show compassion toward our violent assailants, what right have we to the claim of civility?""We both claim and possess civility because we employ less than civil actions toward *only* those who employ violent means toward others and ourselves.  Counter question: What value are we, civil and otherwise, if we choose a violent assailant over friends, family and associates?"

When his turn came to board the plane he was asked to open his briefcase. When he did, I remember the sense of awe when I saw a holstered .38 special and his policemans badge.Perhaps had someone like him been on those planes on 9-11, thousands of lives would have been saved.

2,"You, as one who believes there is no place for physical violence in a civilized culture, may go ahead and use your stun guns, tasers, pepper sprays, etc.  The world could use a few less of your kind.  As someone who looks to the example of those who came before him, however, I see that there are plenty of places for physical violence in civilized culture.  Rome, the antiquity's archetype of civilization, was built on violence.  The Pax Romana, the closest our species has come to world peace, was achieved through war, conquest, intimidation, assassination, and crucifiction.  As a person who believes that physical violence is a necessary part of civilized society, will keep my guns, and woul kindly request that you let me bring them to school with me to protect myself and those I love.  President Theodore Roosevelt once said, ""Talk softly but carry a big stick.""  You don't even have to use that stick, you just have to let them know it's there.  Nobody is going to attempt armed robbery when there is a good chance of armed resistance.  No terrorist would have tried anything with box cutters (or anything else) if they knew a couple of people on that flight are packing heat.  I just don't see pepper spray having the same effect."
2,"Ummm, there are a quite a few people, such as myself, that are not slowed by pepper spray or CS gas. When I was in the military I was one of those folks that was still 80% combat effective after being exposed to a high does of CS gas. 80% combat effective... now add rage to that since you just inflicted severe discomfort and you die.Taser? Come on, those are not exactly non-lethal either. There are several cases in court now due to DEATH caused by tasers. And pepper spray? Ummm I have seen people continue the fight literally undeterred by pepper spray. I am one of those people.Sorry but you want to defend yourself against an ARMED assailant with non-lethal and short distance weapons? You die. You need to understand something, if someone comes in shooting (which is against the LAW as is MURDER!) then just how much of a chance do you think you will have with your non-lethal defense? Both weapons require you to be within 10 feet to be even remotely effective. You die.So you will be one that the cops will come in and stuff into a body tag when it's all over. They will see your mace in one hand and your taser in the other. Nice not knowing you."
2," Naumadd, I'm not against anyone that thinks there shouldn't be alternatives to lethal force. But consider this, How many times have you heard of an assailant or theif or serial rapist that got out of prison and didn't turn right around and return to their old ""habits""? How many time can you tase an attaker before the police arrive? How long do you think it would take for a the guy that broke into some ones house, tried to rape them but were sprayed with pepper spray to wait until he regained his vision and skipped over two or three blocks or even skipped town and finally succeded with his task? I'll agree, alternative measures sometimes may be all it takes to deter violence. But I'd rather be able to take comfort in the fact that I, 1. protected myself and, 2. potentially saved someone elses life. My pro-gun beliefs are not just intended for my own protection or preservation, but I as an idividual feel it is my civic duty to protect a total stranger if the need arises. "

1," A DC handgun ban is a reasonable measure against high gun violence ""Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, then of Duke Law School and now dean of University of California, Irvine, believes that the regulation of guns should be analyzed in the same way ""as other regulation of property under modern constitutional law"" and ""be allowed so long as it is rationally related to achieving a legitimate government purpose."" In the case of Washington, DC, the legitimate purpose at hand has been the extraordinarily high crime rate of the city, at the time when the ban was implemented in 1976 through today. By 1991, DC was considered the murder capital of the country, with 479 deaths that year, 81 deaths per 100,000. As such, it constituted and continues to constitute an exceptional case in the country, warranting exceptional measures, such as a handgun ban. 
"
2,"So I'm sitting here in class (was a student, now a teacher), some kid pulls a gun on me. I'm a law-abiding, qualified citizen. What am I to do? Option A), I don't have the ability to carry a handgun and get my butt blown off the face of the earth because I'm defenseless.Option B), I have a weapon that I only intend to use in dire emergencies and can defend myself when I need to. I have a better chance at survival. Hmmm...seems like a no-brainer to me. "
1,"This is a tough decision for me, but I would have to say students should not be allowed to carry concealed firearms on campus. Let me qualify that by saying I strongly support the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms. In this case, however, there are too many potential problems to warrant such a policy being enacted. First, most people simply lack the proper training to carry weapons. There would inevitably be people who would show off their shiny new pistols, and someone would get hurt. Then, not many people are expert marksmen. If a firefight ensued, I'd wager that some individual would ""go Rambo"" and start shooting everything in sight. If not that, then the stress of being shot at would relegate most people's training to the scrapheap, making them dangerous. In a firefight, one must make a split-second decision to acquire and fire. The stress might cause people to shoot the wrong person. Then you have the issue that possessing a weapon might actually turn someone into a target. Having that weapon might make someone feel invincible and heroic. They may stand their ground in hopes of ""saving the day,"" instead of retreating when doing so might make more sense. this definitely increases the likelihood of the attacker focusing on the individual pointing a weapon at him/her, and killing them.Probably the worst thing about allowing concealed weapons on campus is that it is a double-edged sword. Just like someone can carry for defense, someone else can carry for offensive purposes! Concealed carry could actually make it easier to get a weapon on campus in order to carry out a massacre. I guess the only thing that concerns me about this line of reasoning is that it isn't too hard to sneak a weapon on to most college campuses to begin with...still, I think allowing concealed carry on college campuses is a bad idea."
2,"Okay, I'll play! You say it's a tough decision then go on to say no the students don't have the right to carry. Then you go on to state that “most people simply lack the proper training to carry weapons.” Do you know what it takes to get a CCW?1.Applicant must be 21 years of age or older2.Applicant must be a law-abiding citizen of good character3.Applicant has not been convicted of a felony4.Applicant has not been convicted of any crime of violence5.Applicant has not been convicted of any offense involving the use of alcohol (If it was more than 5 years ago, you may qualify for the permit.)6.Applicant has not been convicted of any offenses involving the unlawful use of drugs or other controlled substances (If it was a misdemeanor more than 10 to 15 years ago, you may still qualify for the permit.)7.Applicant has not been convicted of any offenses involving moral turpitude8.Applicant has not been convicted of any offense involving domestic violence9.Applicant has not been adjudicated by a court of a state or of the United States as mentally incompetent, unless the adjudication has been withdrawn or reversed.10.Applicant must perform a handgun safety handling session before a Utah CCW instructor unless the student as at least one of the following:       * Certificate from NRA Basic Pistol course    * Law enforcement experience    * Certification as an NRA Firearms InstructorHandgun training in military serviceSome states require a psychological examination as well. So it's not just some person willy nilly getting the permit and your fears are unfounded. Then you go on to state that many people are not expert marksmen... private citizens have been shown to make fewer mistakes in identifying an assailant and then hitting said assailant than the police. You CLAIM that the stress of shooting will cause a private citizen to shoot the wrong person... and yet there are very few documented cases when compared to accidental police shootings.   http://www.policeone.com/police/products/articles/116587  /  http://www.actionamerica.org/guns/guns1.shtml  I carry CCW... noone knows and the last thing I am looking for is to get into a gun fight. Every other CCW holder I know is of the same mentality. I think you have watched way too much TV my friend. Owning and carrying a weapon is a very big responsibility and it is not taken lightly by any of us that carry. Anyhow your premise that an attacker will focus on an armed resister... patently wrong. In over 80% of cases recorded, when confronted by an armed resister armed assailants decide they want to be somewhere else and quick and they will leave in a hurry without ever engaging the armed resistance. Go here to get some real life stories of people actually defending themselves...   http://www.claytoncramer.com/gundefenseblog/blogger.html  Probably the worst thing about allowing concealed weapons on campus is that it is a double-edged sword. Just like someone can carry for defense, someone else can carry for offensive purposes! Concealed carry could actually make it easier to get a weapon on campus in order to carry out a massacre. I guess the only thing that concerns me about this line of reasoning is that it isn't too hard to sneak a weapon on to most college campuses to begin with...still, I think allowing concealed carry on college campuses is a bad idea.Double edged sword? Think this through and read the following very carefully, people that bring unlawful (no legal CCW) onto campus are the ones that have the ill intent. There has not been one recorded incident of a CCW initiating any type of massacre. Not one, your fear is unfounded. Illegal carriers tend not to pay attention to those things called laws. That's why law abiding citizens with a CCW are so effective a deterrent. Now think about this real hard, you want to ""make a name"" for yourself by killing as many as you can then capping yourself. Now if your intended victims are all unarmed and you know this, then you know that you can succeed and since schools are stupid because they tell students to play dead or not fight back. In other words instead of teaching survival skills they are training students to be lambs at the slaughter. Anyhow so since there is no credible threat, they can go on killing spree and most likely succeed.Now the same scenario but the rules are changed in that the targets you have selected have the right to carry. You don't know who is packing and who isn't. Your odds of getting far are pretty slim. Slaughter is stopped before it even happens, and not one person had to pull a gun. Just the thought that armed resistance was a real possibility would be enough for any rational person.Oh and last bit, almost every massacre in the United States and Europe (Germany just had another one... and they have strict gun control!) has happened in a gun free zone. Think about that next time you go someplace where guns are not allowed..."
2,"Just as in our neighborhoods, there are not enough campus police officers to protect every individual student, nor is that their job.  Most states that allow concealed carry allow any law-abiding citizen 21 and older to carry.  If we believe 21 is the magic age then why not allow a college student that is 21 to protect themselves if they so choose.  Concealed carry permit holders are some of the most law abiding citizens in the nation and there are numerous cases when CHP holders have stopped an attack without firing a shot.  College campuses are safe but in those rare instances when an attack occurs, an armed student can save lives."
1,"I mean come on, you hear about students that carry a gun to school illegally and shut other students.  You also hear about students that have ""hit lists"" but have never done anything about it.  Letting them carry a gun would just make it that much easier for someone to shoot people on their ""hit list""."
2,"Sorry but after reading many of the pathetic comments in response this topic, I have to wonder about the intellectual capacity of the people making the comments. First off it has been proven on many occasions that guns are not the problem and that more guns in the hands of Law Abiding citizens actually deters crime. You don't have to take my word for it, do your due diligence and go no further than the FBI crime statistics and right to carry states.Your fear of guns stems from a complete ignorance of facts which is readily displayed in many of the postings here. It would behoove you to actually do some research on the subject at hand before your write something that will be published for public scrutiny. And keep in mind when you go to battle based on emotional hearsay with no facts, you generally lose.Fact 1. Your math is incorrect. Again I refer to actual crime statistics and right to carry comparisons. Every state, county, city that has restrictive gun control has a higher violent crime rate than those that exercise right to carry. And again that is based on facts in evidence from the FBI, not some emotional knee jerk reaction... as 99% of the anti-gun rhetoric is wont to be.Fact 2. Gun control does not solve the problem, education does. Watch these three clips and begin to understand your stance is one of ignorant emotional fear.-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmrqT9SIkQw   - John Stossel 20/20-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyoLuTjguJA   - Canada's failed gun control-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGVAQOUi6ec   - England's failed gun control-   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkS8mdbml0A&NR=1   - The woman is on the phone with the POLICE! When she has to use her recently acquired hand gun to save her life. Proof that when you have a choice between 911 and 1911... 1911 is a sure fire way to stay alive.Fact 3. Over 2,000,000 crimes are deterred annually by legally armed citizens. Again these facts can be verified by FBI crime data.I am not going to provide you with the links to the FBI crime data because you can easily find it yourself. That is if your are truly an open minded individual that is ready to accept that maybe your stance is not only based on lies but untenable at best.Thing is I can pretty much with a 99% certainty guarantee you won't even watch any of the videos provided either Mainly because most Liberals I have run into cannot and will not deal with facts. They would rather deal in emotion and use yelling and name calling to attempt to derail a debate or argument that is going against them. Saw that when Ron Paul was kicking arse in the debates, and again with Obama and McCain. Anyhow you will continue to cower in fear due to your ignorance, which you could easily remedy by doing some solid fact searching, while good honest law abiding citizens are out there protecting you by exercising their right to carry.The bottom line is you and your agenda are not the solution, you are part of the problem. But you are incapable of admitting or seeing that since you use emotion instead of logic, reason and intelligence guide your through life. Too bad too, you are in a position to actually provide a solution through education, but you chose instead to use fear. Just like the last administration did and the current one will continue to do.Sincerely a law abiding gun owner and a veteran."
2,"""The Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620. It's documented that they had   guns  . They built the first schoolhouse in 1625. We went about 350 years in this country before there was a   school shooting  . Obviously, guns aren't the problem.""--James GregoryMyth: Gun availability is what is causing school shootingsFact: Schoolyard shootings have been occurring since at least 1974, so it is not a new phenomenon due to increases in gun ownership.  Fact: More than ? of these terrorists start thinking about their assaults two or more weeks before the shooting, and ? planned-out their attacks.  Thoughts: In rural areas, guns are everywhere and   children   are taught to shoot at young ages – yet these areas are almost devoid of schoolyard shootings. Clearly, availability is not the issue.copied from   http://www.gunfacts.info  /These facts should not be surprising.  Gun-free zones are magnets for killers bent on maximizing their body count. These ""Gun-Free Zones are literally ""Victim Preserves""!"
2,"In the grand scheme of things does it really matter? I mean, if someone wants to carry one concealed they will, permit or not. Just like getting a gun to begin with, the laws mean nothing to a criminal and they will carry one regardless of any   law   on the books. Its   the law   abiding citizens that end up getting screwed, or killed because they could not defend themselves against the criminal that could care less. So, lets quit having fear of the unknown. I myself have a conceal and carry(but hardly ever carry it) and part of the process is to take an   education   class and at that point it is the instructors duty to pass/fail as applicable. After this class, the individual should at least know how to handle the weapon safely and responsibly.I feel that if any criminal had any intentions of going into a classroom to do ill will and he knew that it was   legal   and very possible that he could be outnumbered and out gunned by the students themselves, I believe the criminal would think twice if he knew what he was going up against in the beginning. Just like terrorists will probably not hijack a plane again for the fear of the passengers turning on them. Same principal.Then there is the other point. In order to get a permit, the first requirement is that the person be 21. Now, if I am not mistaken people that are 21 and in   college   are pretty much a minority and about ready to graduate anyways, the majority would be the ones under 21 and they cannot get a carry conceal to begin with. So allowing students to carry conceal on campus would be relatively a very small number in consideration to the entire student population."
2,"How about Teachers/Student's can apply for a concealed weapon's license on school grounds from that point they go  through a scanning that checks criminal record, family history, and mental stability. If they pass the screening then they go to a week long   gun control  /safety course. That way it reduces the risk of gang members or mentally insane people being able to carry a gun on campus. Maybe 1/4 of student population and 1/2 of teacher/staff population is able to carry a weapon on campus?"
2,"I fail to see how this is different then obtaining a concealed weapons permit in most states already? All states require a background check, most require you to have no history of mental illness(I am assuming this is all states but I couldn't find statutes for all 50 states so I am just saying most), you must be 21 or older, and most states require some type of   firearms   safety course before you can get a permit. So the chance of gang members and those that are mentally insane getting a permit anyways are incredibly remote if not impossible already. You are just adding another layer of ridiculous requirements onto something we are supposed to have a right to anyways. You also forget that those who wish to carry a weapon illegally on campus will do it no matter what   the law   says, so those that are going to get permits aren't the ones you need to worry about. Those gang members and/or mentally insane wont go through all those requirements they will just carry on campus anyways, they don't care what the laws are. If they are planning on hurting or killing someone why would they care about the laws saying they aren't allowed to carry a weapon on campus?As for the population numbers you must remember that the ratio of concealed weapon permit carriers and normal citizens is about 1 out of 100. So while I believe campus would be safer if over a 1/4 of campus carried as you propose it would never happen. Also you have to take in account the fact that you have to be 21 to obtain a permit so that takes about 80% of the student population out of the equation to begin with. That doesn't even bring in the part about why you are restricting the rights the other half of teachers (or 3/4 of students). What makes them any different from the others? Also why do you believe teachers deserve their rights more than the student body? Like I have said on here before what makes a 27 year old first year teacher different or more deserving of their right to defend themselves than a 25 year old veteran coming back to school? I am not saying its a completely bad idea its just that everything you stated is already being done at a state level so why repeat it. Its just another level of government restriction on our right to keep ourselves safe. "
2," A constitutional right to bear arms is not subject to reasonableness standards A right to bear arms is constitutionally enshrined. As such, it cannot be qualified for the purpose of practical considerations. Legislatures cannot regulate parts of it according to some ""reasonableness"" standard; the right is immutable. The earliest published commentary on the Second Amendment by a major constitutional theorist was by St. George Tucker, also known as The American Blackstone. He authored a set of law books in 1803 that annotated Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England (discussed at length later, under Colonial Rights), for American use, and that formed, in many cases, the sole legal written works read by many early American attorneys.[44] Tucker, the leading Jeffersonian constitutional theorist, was widely read, even by those who rejected his interpretation of the Constitution. In footnotes 40 and 41, he wrote: ""The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government.""[4]
"
2,I agree why shouldn't we all be allowed to carry a concealed weapon on campus. I believe everyone should have that right. But what I meant was more along the lines of lowering the age requirement for   college   student's just so everyone can have that security if they so choose. 
1,"These examples do a good job of proving the point that they guns should be aloud on campus, but i can't help but notice that if guns were illegal in the first place then the problem would never had originated. And i just won't except the argument that we need guns to keep us safe from the criminals that will get guns illegally. There has to be a more mature solution then that. "
1,"Words that no one EVER wants to hear.  When you say, --if guns were illegal--  I feel you, but it is a fact that they DO exist and to wish otherwise is just so much fantasy.  The world can be an ugly place and to know and understand this is the only REAL defense.  To accept where you are is to know how to best proceed.  I believe in the right to keep and bear arms as well as the right to choose to leave your protection in the –limited-- hands of others.  But if you abdicate your responsibility in deference to the state, then you get what you get--fat campus police in swat gear hiding behind trees while your loved ones are being gunned down inside.But I don't believe that guns in book bags are the answer either.  I would advocate a --volunteer only-- campus home guard.  It could be staffers, faculty and administration.  The college could vet, set parameters and police them.  In the cases cited, it was an individual who understood lethal force and used it in defending the innocent."
1,I am a gun owner myself but i have enough selfcontrol to not bring a gun to school.  If schools were as safe as airports and airplanes are now then this topic wouldn't be here. If people didn't do stupid things then the world would be a better place.  
1,"To begin, let’s look at the issue again. The issue is whether or not students should be allowed to carry handguns on college campuses. Two of the three examples you have cited are of adults carrying handguns to protect the children and two of the three examples are also citing instances on high school campuses, not college campuses. So to take out the two misleading examples, we are left with an example of law school students using their personal guns to stop a “rampage”. In this one instance cited, personal handguns were of help in a dangerous situation. And this argument is not to say that handguns are not helpful in certain situations. But when students carry handguns on college campuses, the level of danger is increased. In such a manner, any student may pull out their weapon and use it as a threat legally because handguns would be legal. With handguns legal on college campuses, students have the means to shoot and kill, to take away someone else’s life, right at their fingertips. Self-defense is one thing. But when does the power of carrying a weapon overcome self-defense?Secondly, a “research poll” from 2000 found that 85% of Americans found it appropriate for a principal or teacher to use a gun to defend students. It is true. The majority of Americans want the lives of their students at school protected. But 85% of Americans have stated that they believe it is appropriate for a principal or teacher to do so. Not a student. If the students are the ones with the weapons doing the shootings, is it really sensible for the students to be allowed weapons legally at school?"
2,"I fail to see how allowing students who have a valid concealed weapons permit and are allowed to carry everywhere else in public(depending on the state laws in movie theaters, restaurants, malls, and even bars in some states) is suddenly so much more likely to be violent on a college campus? Firearms are already on college campuses how would allowing those who actually follow the law to carry increase the danger? These adults already carry everywhere else so why would be allowing them to carry across an imaginary line have any effect on their judgment on a self defense situation. You are correct self defense is one thing, but how is not allowing law abiding citizens their right to use the best tools available to protect themselves safer then allowing an unopposed shooting spree. For your second point how is a 30 year old ex marine (such as the one currently having his rights violated by Western Oregon University) different from a 30 year old teacher. Yet again the people that have concealed weapons permits are adults why is the title of teacher make you any more qualified to defend yourself? It has already proven that criminals don't follow the law and they will carry firearms on to campus no matter what the law says so why not let those law abiding citizens that have the will to defend themselves the legal opportunity to do express their right to do so. "
1,"I'm not at all sure I trust anyone on campus with me with a concealed-carry weapon if they're just a student. What if they're paranoid enough to carry a concealed-carry weapon simply because they're paranoid? There's absolutely no assurance that whoever has the gun won't overreact to a tense situation, or a perceived attack, and shoot unarmed people. I support concealed-carry in the hands of people trained to use a gun and discriminate between hostile people and those who are just panicked. Random people with the money to obtain a gun and the nervousness to want to carry one every day do not inspire me with confidence. "
2,"Why is the fact they are students change anything? They still have to be over 21 pass a background check that includes a mental health check and in most states take a firearm class. Carrying a concealed handgun is not paranoia it is the acceptance of responsibility for your own personal protection. Yet again as I have said on here many times what makes a college campus any different from mall, grocery stores, bowling alleys, movie theaters, restaurants or any other place adults with concealed weapons permits can carry. You don't here about a CWP holder going off and shooting unarmed people in those places what makes a college so different. Your second paragraph completely contradicts itself. We aren't saying we are going to go out and arm everyone we are just going to allow those already legally able to carry their firearms everywhere else to be able to defend themselves on college campuses. The way the current laws are written only criminals can carry on campus because they don't follow the laws anyways, those that get CWP's are law abiding citizens that are currently defenseless. "
1,"I know how to load a gun, hold a gun, and fire a gun. I wasn't a bad shot when I was practicing. That does indeed make me unlikely to just accidentally shoot someone. What about the situations you want people to be carrying a gun for? Put me in a school hallway with gunshots coming closer and a gun in my hand, and it probably would end badly; I'd worry I would shoot the wrong person for running through a door and startling me. I have even less confidence in the nerve and judgement of the student body. Flight beats fight unless you've trained for combat. Colleges aren't a threatening atmosphere. Anyone who gets up in the middle of junior year, after an entire year and a half of no incidents and seeing no weapons, and still straps on their concealed-carry holster might just have an issue with his or her threat-assessment meter. That's... uninspiring. "
2,"I never said flight wasn't an option. If I was in a hallway and heard shots coming from one direction I would be going in the other direction looking for cover. I am not some SWOT trained cop my job isn't to protect everyone in the school my job is to protect myself and those I care about. If by protecting myself I am protecting other people around me then that is a byproduct. Now you are just projecting your own abilities onto everyone else, you basically said because you can’t do it no one can. If you were a friend of mine and decided to carry a concealed handgun but still had those reservations I would tell you not to carry you obviously don't have the right mentality to carry yet. To carry you have to accept the fact that you may actually have to use your gun, carrying a handgun when you’re not ready to use it is more dangerous than not carrying. If you aren't ready to pull the trigger you shouldn’t be carrying. I will agree that flight beats fight if it is possible, what I am worried about is the times when you can’t run. The shooter at Vtech locked the doors as he came in so unless there was a window close by you were SOL. I don't know what college you go to but if you haven't seen or heard about any threatening behavior you are very sheltered or very lucky. I carry because I accept the fact that bad things can happen and I would like to be prepared in case it ever does. I will say I have had to draw my gun in defense so it has happened to me not in the town where my college is but it did happen. Statistically I will probably have to draw again in my life but also statistically speaking I will never have to fire my gun and I hope and pray that I never will. I have never been part of a school shooting but I know it is a possible. Actually I am not worried about a major school shooting happening at my campus what scares me is all the other violent crime that is much more prevalent. Including robbery, battery, assault, these crimes even at my campus which is way out in the middle of the country are prevalent. The biggest one around here is forcible rape, it happens here a lot and I know many female friends that would carry if they had the choice to protect themselves from these crimes. Like I said I am not really concerned about a major school shooting (thou I would rather be armed when needed then need it and not be armed) but what I am worried about is walking back to my apartment at 7pm down dark paths because that is the only way home. Also show me where this has happened off campus, I tried looking and I didn't find any instances of a permit holder missing and hitting an innocent person. I am not saying it doesn't happen I know it does but statistically you are more likely to get hit from a cops missed shot than a permit holders. The average distance of a permit holder shots are 10ft or less and the exchange of gunfire lasts less than 10seconds total.  ""What is worse than allowing an execution-style massacre to continue uncontested?  How could any action with the potential to stop or slow a deranged killer intent on slaughtering victim after victim be considered ‘worse’ than allowing that killer to continue undeterred?”   http://www.concealedcampus.org/arguments.htm   please read this it handles most if not all the questions you may have if there are any more let me know and I will try and answer to the best of my ability. "
1," Handguns should be banned due to their uniquely dangerous concealability. Hand guns are concealable as well as portable. This makes them ideal for criminals and murders that seek to be mobile with these weapons and surprise their victims without detection. Rifle's and shotguns do not share this characteristic of portability and so are less dangerous. 
"
2,And just because you lack the confidence doesn't mean other do as well.
1,I think that if someone with alot of money wants a concealed wepon because their paranoid shouldn't be able to obtain one.  If they always think that somone is after them then they should get some help.  If its someone that wants one because they would feel safer in a situation when they are robbed then by all means let them have one.  But for paranoid people that are short tempered and tense in a tight spot.
2,"Let's just get this straight. CCL holders don't carry because they're ""paranoid"", they carry because they're responsible citizens. Everyone that I know, including myself, takes pride in the fact that they've undergone extensive training, through both professional and personal avenues, to make sure that they're intimately knowledgeable about their   firearms   and as prepared as a person can be for a life or death situation. We're not a bunch of gun-toting nutjobs, and we're sure as hell not paranoid.Cars kill many more people per year than   guns  . You probably won't get pulled over everyday, but you carry your license everyday just in case. Same with responsible CCL holders. Even though the chance of use is slight, we still carry just in case. "
2,"It is physically impossible for the police to be everywhere at all times. Both Vtech and NIU had officers or some form of security on campus and shootings still occurred. At NIU the officers responded in under 3 minutes and still 6 people died. That is a phenomenal response time and people still were killed and injured. Not to mention according to the supreme court case Warren v. District of Columbia the police are under know legal responsibility to protect any specific citizen. So actually it is YOUR responsibility to protect yourself so no blaming the government for this one its all on you.These students are also adults you can only obtain a permit in most states if you are over the age of 21. I don't recall any stories where permit holders got mad and pulled their firearms to scare or intimidate off campus so why would it happen on campus.  That is already illegal to do so why does this scenario happen on campus if it doesn't happen off campus when these adults carry everyday. You are right college students have a lot on their plates but since we already proved it is their responsibility to protect themselves i guess they will have to deal. We don't advocate a permit holder to act as a one man/women police force and go after an assailant we just want the opportunity to defend ourselves when we are directly threatened. Also since you have to be 21 in almost all of the states I am not aware of many 21 year-olds that are just out on their own most are college juniors and seniors and they are adults who can already carry in malls, movie theaters, restaurants and in some states bars. They dont cause problems there so why is it that college campuses automatically make every permit holder a deranged killer.  "
2,True school shootings are incredibly rare but what about all the other crimes that occur on college campuses everyday. Ranging from assault to rape why are all those crimes not as important? Why does crossing an imaginary line on to a college campus not allow you the right to self defense? Also the place where you got all your information from is talking about High Schools not college campuses. I don't current have the time to look up college statistics but in the next few days I will attempt to find the stats for college campuses. 
1,"High school students are young. High school students might be in a phase where becoming an adult involves them being exposed to high hormone concentrations, making them rebellious, impulsive and so on, as everyone who ever dealt with teenagers will confirm.If you want to make schools safer, deploy armed guards. Why do students who inherently are istable (puberty) and are fighting (mostly verbally) among each other suited to carry guns in situations where one impulsive reaction of (we have to recall they are still children) a child could easily get another kid killed!Think of the impact for parents and students resulting from one situation where the student making a deadly mistake might not be able to grasp the consequences and will ruin his/her and many others' lives!!"
2,"Here in Arizona, and I'm sure, many other states, most high schools have several police officers assigned to their schools. This is to show a law enforcement presence to protect against gang violence and, possibly, against terrorist attacks.But what about colleges and universities? Arizona State University, for example, has their own police force; but they can't be everywhere at once. And college students are all, legally, adults. Granted, most are not legally able to bear arms, but those who are are far beyond puberty and (usually) are not subject to impulsive reactions. What also needs to be considered, is that those who are of legal age to carry a gun, are protect by the second amendment. So why should our personal liberties be thrown away?"
1,"""[college students] are not subject to impulsive reactions.""this is demonstrably false. "
2,"Geekrock said they were ""not...impulsive...""."
1,"Reckoner said that what geekrock said was false... just by the way.So, whoever says college students are (in contrast to high school students) not subject to impulsive reactions has lost any touch with reality.I have seen too many college kids get into fist-fights from one istant to the next (sometimes but not always under the influence) over some bs to know better..."
1,"The DC handgun ban did decrease crime immediately after passing. The DC handgun ban did decrease crime and murder rates directly after the ban was passed. According to CBS news, ""Homicides in the district did ebb over the next few years, largely following a national trend. In 1977, the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen sharply in D.C. and concluded the ban was working. However, the results were challenged even by the city's police department, which said police tactics had contributed to the drop.""[5]
"
2,"yeah, i reread it afterward and said whoops.no, but CHL holders recognize that they will be held to a higher legal standard than non-CHL holders, and act accordingly."
2,Who said anything about high school students? Concealed handgun permits require the bearers to be at least 21 years of age.
2,"Having an armed guard means he will be the first to go. If someone wants to do serious damage, they either do it in a place where they will meet no resistance, or they are doing it in a place where they can control the enviornment by eliminating the only knwon threat. By allowing CCW or CHP holders (usually 21 and older, not students) to carry at school, you do two things. 1 - you eliminate the safe zone that would have otherwise existed FOR the bad guy. 2 - You take his control of the situation away, by eliminating his knowlege of those that could resist and end his rampage earlier than expected. Although an armed guard is better than nothing, having armed and trained individuals is the better choice."
2,"These examples alone show how everyday citizens can protect themselves and others with the ability to concealed carry a firearm.  Imagine if people like the security officer and the principal did not have firearms on them, innocent lives would have been lost.  I believe that is enough evidence alone to show the capabilities of what the ability to carry a concealed weapon on college campuses.  Nothing can argue otherwise...it is a yes or no situation, yes carry concealed firearms and have the capability to protect yourself, or no, don't allow the carrying of concealed firearms and allow citizens to become subject to the danger that they may face.  "
1,"My Reasons why No Guns on Campus:1) Someone who may have a mental illness may hurt or kill someone.2) There are some(or a lot) of cases that kids in Elementry, Middle and High schools manage to get guns from their parents' or grandparents' room or get a gun from someone else.3) Some colleges tend to have their students to have parties with alchols and if two people(may be drunk) may began to argue a bit and out of norwhere, one of them pull out a gun and shot the another person.I understand couple of colleges allow their students(21 and over) to carry weapons and guns save lives, but guns can also take others lives of innocent people."
2,1. It is already illegal for those that have a mental illness to poses a handgun and they would not in any state be able to obtain a concealed weapons permit so your first point is a complete non-issue. 2. What does this have to do with allowing licensed concealed weapon permit holders to carry on campus? You have to be 21 in most states to get a permit and we are talking about colleges it is against federal law to carry into to a K-12 school. 3. Just about every party I have been too has been off campus so how would allowing permit holders on campus have any effect on this. Permit holders go to parties off campus all the times I have yet to hear any stories from anywhere in the country where a permit holder got drunk and did something. Also no permit holder would carry and then drink it is already illegal and they would have their permit revoked if they got caught. 
2,"""Just because allowing students to carry concealed weapons works in Utah doesn't mean it's going to work in every other state.""Just what is different from the people outside of Utah that will cause this to fail????"
2,"Go take a course on handgun safety before coming up with all these ""maybe this will happen"" arguments.  Drinking while carrying is one of the fastest ways to lose your right to carry.  Fact:  Many Criminals and Crazies already have guns and don't subscribe to this debate.  Fact:  Solid law abiding citizens won't have guns if the law doesn't allow them to have them.Fact:  People who don't believe in guns are not required to carry them.Why are so many people against law abiding citizens?"
2,"I say I'm moving back home to Utah. What does not allowing them on   campus   say to the gun owners? ""Although you're old enough for the government to allow you to have   guns   you can't have them here because there's people."" And out in the street there aren't? People in Utah are not that different from the rest of the country. Those committed enough to complete the course and pass all the checks required to get a concealed carry permit should be allowed to carry it wherever. There should be no double standard. ""Just because allowing students to carry concealed weapons works in Utah doesn't mean it's going to work in every other state.""Sorry. I think it does. A crazy person won't be stopped from a shooting okay fine. Someone who is after someone is not going to barge into one of his classes to take them out if they know some other students in the room could take them down first. People who take guns against those without them are cowards by nature. Confronted with equal or greater force makes them show their true yellow. "
2,"""If government can't protect you, you should have the right to protect yourself,"" said Republican state Sen. Michael Waddoups.""I completely agree with Senator Waddoups.Some people think the police are there to protect them.  Not so.  The police have no   legal   duty to protect anyone.  They are there to enforce   the law  .  That's it.  If you think that is not true, read the book ""Dial 911 and Die"".  It has been out for a long time and the book is as true today as it was when written."
1,"The DC handgun ban has produced a marginal decrease in crime and murders. A 1991 University of Maryland study by criminologists in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, even despite the fact that the number of deaths in the city had risen to 479 that year, 81 deaths per 100,000, earning it the title of the murder capital of the country. They argued the ban had prevented 47 deaths per year in D.C., both suicides and murders.[6] The point of the study is that the handgun ban has had a marginal impact in reducing crime and murder rates. Any such decrease is important and valuable, however small the impact may be. D.C. Council chairman Sterling Tucker said in 2008, ""We knew there were problems we couldn't wipe out. But we had a little more control over it [with the handgun ban].""[7]

1,"Hope to not offend my fellow Americans, but you developed a culture of hysteria in the past...Spying on anyone... permitted. Taking figerprints when entering the country... permitted. Holding hostile combatants without a trial... well... ok... overlooked...All this shows, something terribly bad happens to you and you throw all the liberties, for which you used to be a worldwide role model for centuries, overboard. Rather hysteric, dont you think? So why care about one more liberty (which in my opinion is the most dangerous liberty of all American liberties) lost?I wish I could understand this reasoning..."
2,"The national group Students for Concealed Carry on Campus now has over 36,000 members. Also we don't advocate giving every college student a permit we only wish to allow those who already have a permit to be able to protect themselves on campus as they do everywhere else. What makes a college campus so special? Obviously after Vtech we know that there isn't some invisible force field around colleges that keep evil people out. Criminals don't follow the law so as it sits right now only criminals can carry on college campuses. Why does it matter if they drink on the weekends as long as they aren't carrying I could care less. Last time I checked having some drinks on the weekend doesn't qualify you to be a psycho that wants to shoot up a school. "
2," You don't need a permit to have a gun at a keg party. Why do people keep going back to the keg party thing when talking about carrying on   campus  ? It has nothing to do with anything. These would be 21 year old students that are carrying in Walmart(then maybe go to a keg party). Then maybe going out to eat while carrying (then maybe go to a keg party). Then go home carrying, (Then maybe go to a keg party). Then maybe GO TO CLASS carrying ( then maybe go to a keg party).. Whats the difference here? These   kids   are doing all of this already. It's illegal to carry while drinking. Most people dont ""flash their   guns   around"" Why is it that everywhere else they carry, they act responsibly, but if they carry on campus they're gonna ""go off"". Plenty of college kids dont even drink and most are ACTUALLY ADULTS WITH COMMON SENSE.  If anyone with a permit gets caught drinking while carrying, they can have thier license revoked. Once you have that permit, you dont want to do anything to risk loosing it. Conceal carriers are 6 times LESS likely to commit a   crime   than someone without a permit. Its a fact. Most people that argue against carrying are just uninformed. It only takes about 30 minutes with Mr Google to get the facts. Do you trust a cop firing back at a killer? The fact is, most conceal weapon carriers can out shoot a cop. We practice more than cops do. Cops only have to qualify with their weapon once a year. Some practice very little in betwwen time. Most conceal carriers practice atleast once a month. If my child was sitting in a classroom with the doors barricaded and there was a man with a gun coldly shooting people, you damned right I'd hope someone, ANYONE, would be there to save my daughters life. Even better, MY DAUGHTER BE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO DEFEND HER OWN LIFE on campus and anywhere else she may be. To all that doubt this, i ask that you do research and see the facts. Not studies by the NRA, but by the states, ATF studies etc. "
2,"Wait Brady...Arent these students advocating the right to carry on campus, since they ALREADY carry virtuallyy everywhere else  ??Why would opening the campus to Concealed Carry change any of these factors/variables ???We dont hear about alcohol being a problem with these folks that are carry ""concealed"" in their everyday life, what makes you think allowing these LICENSED students to carry in class would change anything that happens outside of class (the drinking and parties) ???"
2,"Concealed carry is currently allowed at 11 colleges. None of these schools have had a single incident of gun violence, gun theft, or gun related accidents. This same argument (that more guns will cause more violence) was made whenever people were pushing for general concealed carry. Unfortunately for the Brady Campaign, violent crime decreased dramatically in states that allowed law abiding citizens to carry concealed weapons."
2,"Anyone who wants to brin a gun on campus can do so now despite the law. Someone intent on shooting someone cannot be prevented from doing so unless someone else (either the victom or someone nearby) is similarly armed and equiped to shoot the potential murderer.All the anti-gun laws in the world do not disarm criminals or others with evil intent... gun laws do disarm honest, law-abinding people who if allowed to carry weapons could potentially pervent the mayham that is all too common in our schools.Just knowing that some of his classmates couls be armed, may have diisuaded some of the killers and savedd lives. Many of these nut-cases are basically cowards and the possibility that they may be shot as a result of their actions may change their plans."
1,"The statistics presented may be very true; college aged people may be more irrational or inmature.  College students may be more likely to be influenced by alcohol, drugs, or stress as well.  Personally, those characteristics depend on the person.  However, the more people that have guns, the more people there are that have the means to do damage whether it be accidental or intentional.Guns can misfire.  Someone can accidentally pull the trigger.  Someone may think the gun is not loaded.  A gun could fall into the hands of someone irresponsible. A person influenced by alcohol or drugs may pick up a gun and react to a situation that they would normally ignore.  One way to commit suicide would be easily accessible to those depressed individuals who feel they no longer have a purpose in this world. These are just some of the scenarios that could occur.One could argue that if all the students who were held hostage in that lecture hall on the campus of VT had had guns, someone could have taken down the shooter, but what about all the potential misfired bullets?  What about all the negative situations that could have occurred leading up to that instant and taking place after it? Creating more risk in order to attempt to solve one unfortunate situation is illogical. "
2,what if just one student had the means and prevented these tragedies?
2,"StriveforYourDreams-Your argument is based alot on the potential for things to happen, rather than what th reality of a situation may be.  Yes, guns ""can"" misfire and someone ""can"" accidentally pull the triggen, but can you also consider the fact that a gun also has the potential to never misfire at all, or that a person handling a firearm has the repsonsibility and the expertise to never accidentally pull the trigger.  In your response, I see doubt in society and the potential good of everyday people.  As with anything, there is bad aspects, but you are failing to see what is good.  There are plenty of law abiding citizens that have the responsbility and the ability to carry a concealed firearm.  Also, you are placing blame on controlled substances, rather on firearms themselves.  Ultimately it is the fault of an individual, not the firearm that they carry or the drugs that they take.  When you talk about the potential for misfire.  I have been a hunter for 7 years, and all my time spent around firearms, I have never had a gun misfire or hangfire on me.  "
2,"Brady,How many times do you need to hear this and from how many law abiding citizens.  A GUN DID NOT KILL THOSE KIDS AT VIGINIA TECH!!  CHO DID!! And it was made easy for him.   If Virginia Tech allowed CWC how many   parents   would have been spared the agony of empty beds.  My heart goes out to them and they can thank your contributing agenda for being forced to be defenseless sitting ducks.I'm not hearing any gun   shots   coming out of the Utah   campus  '.  I am in Minnesota so it is a bit far for the gunshots to be heard.   What?  No gun battles using a keg as a shield?  No enraged gun battles over a parking space?  No professors being shot for handing out a bad grade?  What you also will not hear from the Utah campus is gunshots of random killers.  They will be much safer at malls and churches unless I am there.  Yes.  I know.  Your misguided agenda would make me a criminal for protecting myself and others.  Just as you did these students.

"
1,"hundreds of   drunk   post-  teens  , showing off for their peers and trying to impress members of the opposite sex.I can see it now....20 year old boys shooting beer cans off each other's heads, not paying attention to everything that is BEHIND the target.Girls fighting over hot boys. Boys fighting over hot girls.Students will shoot strangers that they THINK MIGHT be the person that stole their cellphones and laptops.People will shoot each other for dumb reasons like gropings, car accidents, not helping someone cheat, gossiping, pranks, namecalling, and fights.Students would use their   guns   to intimidate each other, bully each other, and commit crimes, like rapes, robberies, assualts, kidnappings, and murders. Let's not forget about all of the bullet holes everywhere. Who will pay for the damage to cars, buildings, windows, furniture, and other private property?Having a bunch of guns legally on   campus   would just mean that when a psycho DOES start shooting, EVERYONE will start to shoot EVERYONE ELSE, because they think that THAT person, and THAT person, and THAT person are the shooters since THEY HAVE A GUN!!!Someone is going to take their new gun out to show it to their friends, and they'll get shot, because they're waving a gun around.People will accidentally shoot each other, because when they pull the trigger, they will believe that the gun is empty or that the safety is on. Guns in backpacks will go off because the safety is not on.If students have guns then they are going to want to practice their aiming skills. That means building a gun shooting range, or allowing students to make their own targets and practice in an unsafe   environment  , which some will unfortunately do regardless of whether a safe facility is provided for them.Having hundreds of guns on campus, means listening to gunshots at all hours of the day and night. In addition to the annoyance of hearing gunshots, people would become desensitized to the presence of guns and sound of gunshots. Becoming desensitized to the sound of gunshots means that people would ignore them, and thus when a psycho started firing, people would under-react. (In my highschool, the fire alarm would go off at least five times a month because of faulty wiring. In the four years that I attended, I learned to ignore the fire alarm since there was NEVER a real fire. When fire drills were performed, a staff member would have to go on the speaker, and say that ""this is a practice   drill  , please evacuate,"" because otherwise people wouldn't get out of their desks. If there ever was a real fire, no one would respond promptly and there would be a delay of several minutes before people started to evacuate the building.)If teachers,   parents  , and students, feel that guns MUST me present at   schools   in order to ensure the peace, safety, and securtiy of their staff and students, then the TEACHERS should carry guns.I WOULD NEVER GO TO A COLLEGE THAT ALLOWED ITS STUDENTS TO HAVE GUNS, because I wouldn't feel SAFE.I reccommend that people watch this YouTube video. It is a fan-made video that uses scenes from the show ""Trigun"", about and set to the song ""Let There Be Guns"", which is also known as ""Wouldn't It Be Great If Everybody Had A Gun?"" The song is by Arrogant Worms.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCtD3OJ-_Es  Episode#3 of Trigun is suppossed to show both sides of the gun argument - that murderous gangs would develop and that people would use guns to defend themselves."
2,"Please Please Please go do some research before you post such things that are so incorrect and full of fallacies and misconceptions. I am going to attempt to answer your assumptions one at a time. First you have to be 21 to obtain a Concealed Weapons Permit(CWP) so having 20 year-olds isn't going to happen. As for the next 7 or so small paragraphs, I am sorry you feel like you would do this if you owned or carried a gun but as history shows us none of the scenarios you listed have happened ever. CWP holders carry everywhere off campus so why does the imaginary line of crossing on campus suddenly make everyone irresponsible and basically stupid? This stuff doesn't happen off campus so why would it mysteriously happen on campus. As for the drinking how many times have you gone drunk to class? I know I never have and nor as anyone I know. I obviously don't know the number of CWP holders in the US to assume there are enough to have multiple CWP holders at one place during one shooting and them take each other out(again never happened anywhere off campus so why will it happen on campus). In the US there are about 1 CWP holder out of every 100 citizens. For the 21-30 age group that is much lower in the range of 1 in 300. So in your largest lecture class of 300+ students you statistically might have 1 CWP holder carrying a weapon for self defense. In your next section you state instances several times of   guns   just going off. I have been working with   firearms   for a long time and I also am an instructor and I can tell you will all certainty there is no presently built firearm that just goes off. Companies go out of their way to make sure a firearm cant just go off, almost all new firearms also have drop safeties so you could throw it out a car at 100mph and it still wouldn't go off(it would ruin a perfectly good handgun tho). I am seeing in your writing that you have a genuine fear of firearms and I am sorry for that, I really suggest you go to a local range and go talk to the people there about possibly taking a class so you can better understand firearms and their use because you really don't understand them now. As for the becoming desensitized to gunshots, first all of your other scenarios are completely baseless so you wouldn't have this massive increase of gunfire anyways, but even if you did(never would happen) most people don't know what sound a firearm really makes anyways. They assume it is a car backfiring or a firecracker. As for allowing teachers to carry and not students what is the difference between a first year teacher and a 26 year old Iraq veteran going back to school? Why or how is the teacher better qualified than the student? Ok so after watching your so called video evidence it makes sense that you have a distorted view of reality please visit   http://www.concealedcampus.org/common_arguments.php   to get a dose of reality.  You obviously don't understand firearms or their owners so I am not going to spend any more time on you. Please just do some research before you post any other fantasy scenario that has/would never happen. "
2,"By reading your post, sounds to me like the problem is Alcohol and Drugs and the firearm is secondary for protection. I'm going to take a wild guess and say you are not campaigning for alcohol free schools. Easier to blame the firearm and hold nobody accountable for their actions."
1,Guns are meant to be in the hands of law enforcement who are trained to use them not in the hands of college students. The fact that drugs and alcohol are often used on college campuses is the first indicator that guns should not joining this dangerous mix. The result would not lead to more safety but to more tragedies. A person who has been using drugs or alcohol is not fit to drive a car so why would they be allowed to use a gun? It seems that in our haste to feel safe on college campuses all we would be doing is creating more problems. 
2,"Well it is already illegal to carry a firearm will under the influence so those LAW ABIDING citizens who have permits wouldn't be carrying while intoxicated anyways. I have numerous firearms in my apartment, so do many of my friends and I am aware of at least one fraternity who has multiple gun safes in their house. I have yet to hear of an incident in at my college campus. No to mention how many students do you know that come to class drunk? Most of the parties I am aware of are off campus where guns are already present so how would allowing them on campus by licensed individuals to and from class make it any more dangerous? Also you don't need 9 months of training to know how to use a firearm for self defense. Most self defense situations occur at less than 12 feet and last mere seconds. You like many of those against this concealed carry on this forum forget that these college students are adults that carry everywhere else why does a college campus automatically make someone prone to violence? "
2,Why are you viilianizing the firearm when the your main argument is controlled substances?Come on do you really think this is a good argument against the students constitutionally guaranteed right?
2,"The study that the BC keeps referencing is flawed. I read the study and it asks if the participant has a working gun on campus (illegal in most cases) and also does other illegal things (drugs etc.). Well duh! I'm sure if they aren't listening to the no   guns   policy, they probably don't care about   the law   and therefore won't care about breaking others. I'm also going to make the generalization that if someone cares less about the law they are probably more likely to show violence toward their fellow man (and woman). So I don't think that going from a yes answer to the question ""do you have an illegal gun ON campus"" should be quoted as ""gun owners"". Don't twist the facts."
2,"Its amazing that when firearm related suicide lethality is compared to other methods, they always leave out hanging...which is MORE lethal than firearms. People that are determined enough to use a gun probably wouldn't be detered by the face that they can't get one...they would find another way.If the Brady Campaign was really interested in lowering the number of suicides on campus, the would focus on eliminating alcohol. No matter the method (OD, Firearm, hanging/strangulation, cutting etc.) many (if not the majority) people attempting suicide are under the influence. But that's not their concern...their concern is to get rid of guns, and they attempt to do so by using scare tactics."
2,"The issue of   guns   shouldn't even be brought up when talking about   suicide   any more than any other method. Numerous studies (by independant sources) have shown that even when guns are limited, the only thing that goes down is suicide by guns. The over all (successful, not attempted) suicide rate stays exactly the same. So obviously this isn't about guns, it's about suicide. Maybe once we start focusing on the real issue, we might actually be help to help the true victims and fix the problem. "
2,"So Brady...At ALL 9 Public Universities in Utah, as well as Colorado State University and Blue Ridge Community College in Virginia there has NEVER been a gun theft on campus. And as you know, all of these places currently allow LICENSED students to carry on campus.These 21+ year olds are not the students living in dorms, or on campus.. Most Universities wont allow students that have over 60 hours (19-20 years old) to live on campus.It's not ""increasing gun ownership"", these students are ALREADY licensed to carry virtually EVERYWHERE else. They already have the licenses, and they already have the firearms (and there havent been any problems).When will the Brady Campaign stop the LIES ???"
1," A ban on assault weapons is not a slippery slope to an all gun ban. Most individuals seeking a ban on assault weapons just want assault weapons to be banned.

1," Proper regulation of handgun use increases safety Legal scholar acknowledge that the individual right of keeping arms can be limited  for the safety of the community.This limitation occurs through regulating the possession, use and tracing of guns within society.
"
2,"The idea of the potential of gun theft on college campus where concealed carrying is allowed is absolutely absurd.  As ""mer"" comments previously, an individual would not leave a handgun around like they would a bookbag so that someone else would have the ability to possibly take it from them.  The point of concealed carry is so that others won't be able to see it.  I do not know much about how the actual process works, as far of rules on how you are to carry, but I am sure that the firearm always will be, and has to be on the person in the form of a gun holster or a gun belt.  If a person would be so irresponsible as to not keep track of thier firearm, then they are the type of individual that should not, and does not deserve to carry.  Despite these few people in the population, I do believe that for each person that would do something as stupid as leave their gun behind, there are plenty more law abiding citizens that will utilize their privilege of concealed carrying of a firearm for their own personal protection.  "
1,"This argument has a good point.  While the idea of keeping a concealed gun at college may seem like a logical way to protect oneself from assaulters, it is actually true that this is still very dangerous.  As this article discusses, there is a chance that the weapon can be shot accidently or shot while unknowingly still holding ammo.  Even the purchasers of these guns may not be fully aware as to how to use them properly.  The owners of these weapons may be scared young adults choosing to keep one just in case, a desperate way to keep themselves safe which in reality is puts not only jeopardizes their own health, but the health of those around them as well.  These risks are not worth someone's life; as the article clearly states, ""If there are no guns on campus, these types of accidents [as in gun shootings] cannot occur."""
2,"So you would rather not allow law abiding students any chance at protecting themselves from criminals from various crimes from assault, rape to murder on the fact that there is a small chance of an accident. Firearm accidents are incredibly rare and someone getting injured in a firearm accident is even rarer. But even the federal government states that firearms are used over 2 million times a year for self defense. Also the statement that guns on campus is a completely fallacy, guns are on campus the incidents at VTech and NIU prove that criminals wont follow the law and the cops cant be everywhere at once to protect everyone. Not to mention by your thought cops shouldnt be allowed on campus because they carry firearms and they could accidentally shoot someone. "
1,"There are alternatives for students to protect themselves ""from criminals from various crimes from assault, rape to murder.""  The colleges themselves can provide self defense classes to teach students specific techniques to protect themselves from attackers.  These classes can even include what one should do in different situations of a gun attack without actually having to fire back with a gun, but instead with the weapons around us everyday, like knives and hammers.  Even concealed self defense items like pepper spray may be the difference between life and death; it depends on the situation.  Yes, security does indeed hold firearms, but they are trained; they actually know what they are doing and are less likely to shoot someone irrationally or accidently.  Even students who are knowledgeable on how to use guns should not be permitted to carry them, exposed or concealed, on campus.  Campus often times is a temporary home to students, a place where they can seek safety.  How can they feel safe knowing that everyone around them is potentially carrying a gun, from the calm and seemingly harmless students to the troublemakers who are arrested at least twice a month?  Concealed firearms can quickly escalate a simple argument into a tragedy.  And if there is an attacker, with or without a gun, the concealed firearms of the victims can be used against them if they are overpowered.  The police and campus security not only try to stop attacks while they are happening, but they also try to avoid them from occurring in the first place.  With students allowed to have concealed weapons on campus, it would be more difficult for security to decipher who could be considered a potential threat and who is not.  Plus, what edge do the cops have if the students are allowed to carry concealed firearms?  No, students and people in general do not always follow the law, and of course the ""cops cant be everywhere at once to protect everyone.""  However, aren’t the chances of a shooting lessened if it is forbidden for students to carry firearms on campus, especially considering that security would be on the lookout for such weaponry?  And when does it end?  A pistol, a rifle, a semiautomatic?  To believe that they do not have “any chance” at protecting themselves without possessing a gun is a fallacy; it is a lie.  Besides, once you decide to carry a gun for constant protection from others, you decide to view all other people as potential enemies instead of potential friends.  And with this lack of faith in humankind you have taken that first small step into the direction of using your weapon for the wrong reason or worse out of hasty impulse."
2,"True there are other alternatives for students the best and most powerful is situational awareness which includes paying attention to your surroundings and the people close to you. Staying out of a confrontation is always the best solution. But you must remember once you are in a confrontation to be able to use any of the solutions you advised you would have to be very very close as in within arm’s reach which could be too close. Even if you are trained in self defense you still need to be very close when the attack happens, be on steady ground with firm footing, not have anything between yourself and the attacker, and be able for a short time overpower your attacker. If you are that close you risk much more injury to yourself as much as injury to your attacker. Why is it when you draw a firearm the person would overpower and disarm you but you fail to mention that is much more likely when you have to get close as with the weapons you advised. I have taken some of these classes because the last thing I ever want to do is fire on another human being, I am well aware that a gun is not the end all solution to every problem but it is the most powerful last resort and average person can carry. Also it should be noted that pepper spray effects everyone differently and it doesn't always work. I do carry it in my car and in doing so I have been hit with it before to make sure I can still see if I ever have to deploy it close to myself and form personal experience it didn't have that much effect on me other than make me very angry and agitated not immobilized by any means. Also what makes a security officer more highly trained that an average citizen with a concealed weapons permit (cwp)? In most states the same class is required for both licenses. I would also like to know where you got the stat that average citizens are more likely to ""irrationally or accidentally"" shoot an innocent person when according to the GOA fact sheet(  http://gunowners.org/fs0404.htm  )only 2 percent of civilian shootings involve an innocent person being mistaken for a criminal but the error rate for police is more than 11% thats more than 5 times the civilian rate. Your possibility of ""everyone carrying a gun"" is also not even close to the average in shall issue states is that there is one person out of a hundred who carries a firearm for self defense. This means there might be one in your class or possibly one on your dorm hall. I would also like to know what state you live in because I don't see people getting scared when people carry concealed weapons in malls, grocery stores, restaurants, or movie theaters. Why would allowing law abiding citizens their right to carry on campuses be any different?  Also if a student is arrested twice a month as you put it they would not pass the background check necessary to obtain a cwp in most states.  "
2,"The cops are always going to be at a disadvantage they never know who is carrying and who isn't, criminals always have the advantage of surprise. With the present situation only criminals are carrying their firearms so how would people who actually follow the law endanger or hinder the officers efforts? Before you say they wont be able to tell who the attacker is in a shooting event find me one instance where that has happened off a college campus because I looked and couldn't find even one instance. Also since it says concealed then it means concealed I carry a full size handgun and I have many friends who don't know I carry and no one has ever noticed it. That is also the reason I don't believe there is a need for rifles on campus because they cannot be concealed and gets rid of the element of surprise. You really need to go Google ""semiautomatic"", most firearms sold today are semiautomatic and they are no more dangerous than any other firearm out there. They still fire one bullet for one trigger pull just like any revolver or hunting rifle, they are no more dangerous or deadly. Tell me how you are going to protect yourself from an armed attacker at 20ft, hell make it 15ft, how is it a fallacy or how am I a liar? Do you have other options yea possibly; you might be able to run away, maybe the attacker will be stupid and get close so you can attempt some move you saw in a movie, maybe you have pepper spray and the person reacts the same way I did and gets more agitated and angry and kills you anyways(not to mention most sprays can take up to 15 seconds to fully start working and are also banned on most college campuses).I carry a gun everyday at all times where it is legal and I don't look at everyone as a potential enemy but I do understand and accept the fact that there are evil people out there that would hurt me or my family and I will do whatever it takes to keep my loved ones safe. Also by your reasoning every cop in America that carries a firearm is on their way to using their weapon for the wrong reason or out of hasty impulse. Remember cops are only people too and they also make mistakes statistically they make more mistakes than armed civilians, cwp holders are the most law abiding group of citizens in the country just look up statistics in Florida or Texas(those two states keep the best records) and you will find that around .1 or .2% of all cwp holders are ever arrested for a felony. Do some research before you come up with some random scenarios that could possibly happen but they only occur on college campuses and not everywhere else concealed carry is legal or making up statistics that fit your opinion.  "
2,"@Nada's Comments- The points that you do present are very valid, concerning both the presented issues of an individual's proficiency in using a concealed firearm, and the issue of accidental shootings in its entirety.@Tenmaster96- With myself being a person who hunts, has hunted forever, and is on a competition trapshooting team, I do, and will forever retain a respect for firearms.  I know their capabilities, and what they can do, but despite everything else, I do agree when it is stated that accidental shooting are rare, and the ability to carry a concealed weapon will most definately be a benefit to students on campus.  In my state, it is a proven statistic that hunting, above all other forms of recreation, have the lowest rate of personal injury, virutally zero.  Hunting is the safest sport of all, oddly enough.  When good citizens that know the parameters of what can happen with a firearm, are able to carry, then they have now become able to protect themselves and others.  God forbid if I was ever faced with a situation such as an intruder in school, I would know that I could defend myself and others.  I do understand Nada's argument of how people who may carry concealed weapons do not have proper expereince with firearms, but with yourself, being a ""concealed-carrier"", did you have to complete a firearm safety course before being given your permit?  If we think about it, whether you are in an area that allows concealed carrying or not, if things move as to the extreme of guns being banned, all of the law abiding citizens would not be protected, and no matter what the laws were, all the ""bad guys"" with bad intentions would have thier way no matter what..and this is why it is all the more reasonable that students should be allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus."
2,"I currently carry Concealed Weapons Permits(cwp) or Concealed Handgun Licensees(chl) from 3 different states. Two of those state required mandatory training before I was able to obtain the permit or license. Everyone I know that carries practices on a regular basis and/or competes in pistol shooting competition. I have a mandatory 100 rounds a month at the minimum that I must shoot if I am not competing in a competition that month. That is a personal requirement I keep, if I don't shoot that month then I don't carry, from what I have seen from most police firearms training schedules I shoot more than most cops. It is usually closer to 200-300 rounds a month with upwards of 1000 on months with more than one competition or if I can afford it. I am also taking the instructor/range master course this summer so I can teach the class that is necessary to obtain a CWP in my state"
2,"""Temporarily insane""?  Who, might I ask, are you to make such a generalized judgment about the college population?  Individuals with concealed carry permits carry other places on a daily basis, what is it about stepping onto a college campus that makes the ""temporarily insane""?"
2,"Current Black Market law only requires that cash be paid upfront on any purchase, including guns.  Criminals, terrorists, and mentally ill individuals can buy military grade, as opposed to ""style,"" as in, military looking, weapons, in amounts limited only by the amount of cash they have.  This law doesn't show much sign of changing.  Laws requiring background checks and such will drive those killers, and their funds, to the black market, allowing it to expand, rather than allowing growth in the legal economy.  This will increase the power and standing of illegal organizations and increase the amount and variety of goods available.  It's a terrible idea.  It does, however, have a convenient side effect.  It gives the Federal government a list of all legal gun owners in the event that it should ever confiscate all guns.As far as ""temporarily insane,"" untrained teenage lunatics wandering around shooting people, we aren't saying that all students should be allowed to concealed carry at all.  The permit for concealed carry is actually pretty tough to get, requiring actual classes be completed and passed, criminal background checks, etc.  All of that is fine for a concealed carry permit, as opposed to actual ownership, because criminals even though criminals won't bother with the permit, idiots will, and those who would engage in drunken gunfights would be weeded out.  Even tougher permits could be required for concealed carry on campus.  As far as arming teachers, why shouldn't a teacher have the right to defend him/herself?  I don't know the South Africa case, but I'm sure the tension in the classroom had to be pretty high for a teacher to believe a student was pulling a gun out.  Someone who had taken classes to get a concealed carry on campus permit would have known to tell him to freeze and put his hands up before firing.  The gun is for last chance situations, for example if the firearm is being brandished or fired.  You also make the absurd assumption that parents wouldn't want to send their children to a school that gives them the ability to defend themselves, as opposed to sitting helplessly awaiting execution, in the event of an emergency.  That could easily be put to the test.  Give schools the choice to allow or disallow concealed carry, and see which schools attract students and which do not.In your final agrument, you make a feeble attempt to justify a confiscation list, that would allow the government to remove the citizenry's last defense against tyranny."
1,"The social harm related to firearms outweighs any social benefits from possessing firearms It is empirically proven that the numbers of victims from gun related  attacks or incidents far outweigh the number of instances when arms were used for self protection.This warrants the argument that the costs incurred on society through the usage of arms are higher the the benefits the possession of arms for self defense brings
"
2,"Your argument is so poorly presented that it is close to not making sense at all.  Obviously just a passionately heated pile of rhetoric not based on sound research or truth.I am not worried about some keg pary where someone might be carrying a gun.  These parties are completely unregulated and have nothing to do with the argument.  The point is protecting our youth while they are attending classes.  Something that our police and security systems have largeley failed to do.Why not arm our youth?  We send them overseas to fight and die.  At 18 we are considered adults but most of the people I know who carry have been inculcated since a young age about the responsibilities related to firearms.  ""An armed society is a polite society."""
2,"You are obviously informed of your ""opinion"" based on buzz words and statements repeatedly given credibility that have a political agenda.Did you know that it is a criminal offense in and of itself to consume   alcohol   and carry?  The person or student that does has not gone through concealed weapons training and therefore not legal.  We are talking legal law abiding students that should be allowed to protect themselves and others should they need to.People of your mindset do not find the common denominator in Virginia Tech, Colorado Springs, Mumbai or even the holocaust to name a few.  The criminal, and in the one case a government, has found the common denominator.  Why do you think the psycho's don't choose our local rod and gun clubs for their killing sprees.CWC permit holders have a grave responsibility whether a student or citizen.  Not only do they put their lives in danger they better be trained and skillful so no harm comes to innocents.  The biggest responsibility? If there is reason to pull it you use it and the one to go home to his family is you.  There is no such thing as a fair fight.  If it is fair the tactics need to be rethought.What isn't fair is a   college   campus full of innocents being defenselessly gunned down and their   parents   with empty beds from lack of one person on the right side of the law not being able to carry.   "
2,"College students don't drink beer in class and won't kill each other for reaching for a pen.  This is about preventing incidents like Virginia Tech and Columbine.  Had a single person been allowed to defend themselves (or had the cops actually done something) the victims would still be alive.  Keeping   guns   off campus won't prevent these incidents because killers will not follow the rules anyway. ""Gun-free Zones"" only protect the killers by disarming their prey.  Even if you can prevent people from taking guns to a frat party, there will still be knives, beer bottles, screwdrivers and baseball bats.  The point is that if someone has an intent to harm or kill you, they will find a way to do it.  I have seen someone nearly get stabbed at a party and I have seen a golf club pulled out as a weapon.  Surely nobody wants to ban golf clubs.  It appears your objection lies with   alcohol  , not guns so why don't you advocate a return to Prohibition?  Guns are simply a tool, they are useless lying on the ground.  There have been many women on my own campus that have been sexually assaulted; don't they also deserve the right to defend themselves?  What about preventing a break-in or robbery?  Mass killings are not the only things Concealed Carry can help prevent."
2,"People need the right of defense, safty, a gun. People argue that it will just put guns in the wrong hands, but arent they already? Really will makeing it Illegal do anything? I think not, because its not Guns that kills people, its people. The gun wont kill you without someone behind it, not all people have the right reasons for haveing a gun, but does that mean people who do have the right reasons will be punished and left unarmed, and defensless?"
1,"You go to school everyday with the requirement to not bare arms and do you honestly feel defenseless? 84% of americans havent taken one safety course on guns so its a threat to anyone, behind and infront of the gun. In alot of gun injuries, the user is harmed too. Guns should be left in trained haneds and with all the other types of defense methods, guns should not be the defult."
2,"It's not that hard to learn how to use a gun. I'm 15, and in just 3 hours, when I was 12 years old, I learned how to safely use a rifle, pistol, and shotgun.Why can we trust the people LIKE US in the military with automatic weapons, tanks, and explosives to defend our own country but we can't trust ourselves to defend our own lives?I do, however, agree with the fact anyone willing to buy a gun should take some kind of safety course or such, and we should make it a law."
2,"one needs the right of self defense, one needs the right to feel safe in any circumstance. Yet one also needs to know self restraint, such weapons as a ALL assault weapons should not be allowed, but a hunting rifle and pistols should be allowed."
1,"With all the other types of self defenise available and the many more being created, i dont think something as barbaric as a good should be the ""fall back defensive."""
2,"do you mean a gun should not be the fall back defensive???The gun is a weapon made for the peasents, for those soldiers who couldnt take years to train. Of all the other weapons in the world the gun is the most efficient for self defense, taking little training and thought to use. Are you saying a knife would work better when the majority of Americans dont even know how to use a knife??? They would end up cutting themselves let alone their assaulters. If one had a gun, a single warning shot in the air will make them run before the need of killing. however one still needs to have the killing intent or they will be attacked and be in a tausle for the gun."
2,"Yo. Law abiding citizens should be allowed to have guns, not convicted criminals. If someone plans to buy a gun, the shop owner should have to do a background check on the customer. That way, law abiding citizens can be the ones with guns, that they'll only use for protection against intruders. I mean, come on. If you think that gun control will help this country, you are sorely mistaken. Criminals aren't stupid. They'll keep their guns while the law-abiding citizens while fork 'em over to the government. I think you see where I'm going with this. Every citizen law abiding citizen has the right to bear arms."
1,"Worldwide the ownership of handguns has been correlated with higher homicide ratesIt has been empirically proven that among countries of the world the ones with the lowest private ownership of handguns have a significantly lower homicide rate 
"
1,"Even if a background check is preformed and comes out clean, most americans have no history of gun safety. Also, though americans may be ""law abiding"" they still are animals and have natural reactions, there is NO human alive that hasnt been startled before or scared. Its those feelings that provoke gun use as a defense in the first place. If you want defense against intruders, try a home alarm system, a loud barking dog will even warn you without killing someone. If you want to stop someone, use another form of defense like a taser. Some people may say, but what if they have a gun? If there was gun control, that couldnt be the case, yes there will always be violent people, but without guns there would be less dead people. At school no one has a gun, its just how it is, and in the cases where one was entered into the environment, there was a set plan to stay safe and the deaths are obviously lower from that event, then they would be if guns were aloud daily. Guns make room for emotional mistakes and kill the need for restraint. I do think gun control will help this country and i am not mistaken. If criminals keep their guns, they wont be able to use them. Why? People if no one had a gun in an area and one single shot was heard, the whole area would be on alert for that one shot and the gun would get confiscated. In countries like great britan where there is strict gun control, this happens all the time. If we just assume its useless cause we have some criminals and just have to bare arms to balance it out then its just twice as dangerous, two lefts don't make a right. Anyone that is considered a ""criminal"" is on record by the US government and will be searched before the citizens for that reason. The government is smart enough to realize that criminals would have guns, its not something thats just overlooked."
2,i think if people are responsible they should be able to buy and use firarms. but theres some people who use them for the wrong reason and that is what makes little familys cry because there loved one was gunned down by a horable person ;(((((((((((
1,"Your side sounds more ""against gun control"". Responsible people, in my opinion, are the ones who have been trained and are armed with guns under government authorization. Which is quite rarely an average american citizen. You state, ""but theres some people who use them for the wrong reason and that is what makes little familys cry because there loved one was gunned down by a horable person ;((((((((((("". That quote is much more for the ""against side"" and hurts your arugment"
2,Right to bear arms- second amendment of the constitution. weapons are used for many reasons these days. some use weapons for sport some use them for looks some use them for fun. although some people have killed people with guns also we shouldnt take our constitutional rights away do to a few mentally psychotic or duranged people
1,"First of all its not in the constitution itself, its simply an amendment, i think you should read about what your talking about before you go and time up and argument on it. Here is the a the direct quoteA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.In oder for the state to be secure we cannot have deadly weapons used for looks like they are some new type of hot wheels made for fun and looks. Your constitutional right is to keep and bare arms, not guns, and for the safety of the state and all in it we need to take away simple dangers for citizens, cause eventually we need to stop playing with hot wheels and grow up."
2,I think that people should be able to have guns because they might need them to protect themselves if they live in a bad neighborhood and it is in the bill of rights.
1,"The bill of rights does not state the an individual citizen has their own right to have their own gun, id read up on that before making that statement. People who live in a bad neighbor hood can move, or live in a protected shelter if moving is not an option. People who consider a neighborhood unsafe often think so because of guns. I myself often think ""someones gonna come out and shoot me"" when walking through bad neighborhoods. If citizens didn't have guns, that would make everyone feel that much safer. In unsafe neighborhoods, there would be one less worry of not getting hurt by some irresponsible citizen with a gun."
2,"people have rights. this is a free country. we have the right to defend ourselves, but guns should come with a rule book. just my oppinion tho."
1,"Guns dont need a rule book, people need to be trained in what they are using and most citizen have never taken a gun safety course. People do have rights but they should not have the right to end someones life because they were scared the MIGHT loose their own, and thats the self defense argument. If you wanna feel safe there are so many less barbaric and deadly options then a gun. We are humans, not deer. If you pepper spray and tase an intruder, what more can they do? They cant see or move...so they cant shoot you and they are still alive. We do have a free country, we should make it safe too."
2,"Brad, just because the Criminals may be more prepared and we might not have the time to grab our gun that doesnt mean that guns shouldnt be alowed, all your saying is based on circumstances, and luck"
2," Citizen gun ownership acts as a deterrent against criminals When citizens have guns, criminals fear committing crimes due to the risk that they will be shot. Many studies indicate that this deterrent effect decreases violent crime rates. The correlation is not surprising.
"
1,"This comment should be under brads statement, but to dispute. Timing may just be a statement but the guns are still the main focus. Guns shouldnt be allow because the defenders want to shoot just as much as the intruders. I think i covered this in more detail when i explained the pros of having citizens being gun free.Even ""If criminals keep their guns"",(if we were to confiscate all guns) "" they wont be able to use them. If no one had a gun in an area and one single shot was heard, the whole area would be on alert for that one shot and the gun would get confiscated.

2,"People should have the right to bear arms. If guns were to be banned, people would still have them in their homes and on the streets. Its just how things work. Some people say that taking away the right to bear arms will decrease crime rate, but when the righs is taken away, more damage will be done due to lack of self defense. We dont want that !"
1,"I feel like im repeating myself. But to simplify what ive been saying, if the government had gun control they would start out with the high risk people such as criminals and work their way down. Not having guns would be an overall safer environment. A common environment like this is school. Some people argue that there are still school shootings and this is true and also related to your idea of ""its just how things work."" While their are school shooting they are vary rare, just like america would be if we didnt have guns. Schools also are prepared, remember doing those lock down drills? Our country would prepare us the same way. School shootings cause far less deaths then if schools were aloud on a daily bases to everyone (like america now). We should leave guns to the professionals and if we need to feel safe, we should protect ourselves without killing someone else."
2,"The statement of ""Guns kill people, Guns kill children"" is false guns dont kill people, people kill people.Guns should be aloud everywere GUNS ARE GOOD."
1,"This comment should be under the comment instead of on the ""arguments for"" side. This side is for your individual comments, as to debate with you, guns should not be aloud in the hands of citizens because it is the gun that kills the people, the person. If the person was responsible, you could take the gun out of the situation and someone would still die, this is not true. The gun is what is directly taking the human life. To say that quote is false is just commonly statisticly untrue, as stated in my argument Against; ""For example, during a year when over 5,000 teens and children died from gun wounds in the USA, in Great Britain, where gun ownership is very restricted, 19 teens and children died from gun wounds."""
2,"I posted this on a similar debate and i believe it clearly shows my views:I agree that one should have the right to own arms but i do not believe on has to use violence to obtain their wildest gun dreams. if one wants to own a gun i have no qualms with them but if they wish to own guns such as a AK47 and AK74u they should be dealt with in a more civilized manner to protect the people. A hunting rifle is fine, a pistol is fine, an automatic or assault rifle is over doing it specially since the only reason an American needs a gun such as a rifle is for hunting. I am not saying all guns are for hunting a pistol may be used for self defense, But only as a Deterrence to violence."
1,"Although its not your idea, i think its still well formed. My dispute is that hunting and other recreational guns should be stored safely in the place where the recreation is taking place. For example, hunting guns should be stored under lock and key at those hunting grounds, then checked out and returned as not to take them home cause harm to non-deer life like humans.As for the topic of self defense, guns should not be used as a common self defense. Why? Lets use a simple example, your walking home in the dark its quite and you think someones following you so have your hand on the gun and keep walking, looking back. Suddenly a car pulls in front of you, startled you naturally turn around and shoot. Theirs no one behind you, but an innocent dead driver in front of you. Its simple ""accidents"" like these account for most deaths. Having something less likely to kill a person, such as a taser, is much safer. Some people may argue that it doesnt do enough damage to defend somone, but taserd stop your muscles from moving, stopping whoever right in their tracks, alive. We should stop using guns for defense like we do, nothing that deadly should be so self conscious."
2,"Guns rights is in a pretty good position right now. You can own a gun, if proven trustworthy. This is not the case in all states, but it is in most. Some argue that it is dangerous to be giving out guns, but with guns-rights or no gun-rights criminals will still have guns. However, the average person who wants to own a gun for self-defense will be prohibited to without guns-rights. Meanwhile, with gun-rights the average person can own a gun AND protect himself against criminals."
1,"Although I'm against guns, what you are saying is absolutely correct.As far as Americas majority of people who do want gun rights, they are in a pretty good position.As i said in my first argument, my husband is all for guns and is one of those affected by Australia's recent gun laws. My hubby ""wishes he had your gun rights America, so be grateful""....Personally i think its the reason behind half your problems... however my hubby,(in this moment i am typing) just rebutted me by saying that in Switzerland, they encourage, that all their citizens have a gun."
2,"We have to look outside the box. Criminals WILL ABSOLUTLEY get a hold of guns whether there is a law banning firearms or not. If you don't believe in guns, then don't buy a damn gun. If you feel safe in your home without a gun, then don't buy a damn gun. If you feel safe walking amongst thieves and murderers with just a can of pepper spray, then....say it with it me.....Don't buy a damn gun. Me? I like the idea that if I have the CHOICE, I could LETHALLY defend me or a loved one. I don't know about you, but I live outside the box. On the outside we don't live in a perfect world where there isn't crime and violence. I'm not a trigger happy fellow either as you might paint us gun rights enthusiasts. I dread the thought of the day I might have to take the life of another human being. You know what though?.....It could be mine that's taken from me if I fail to protect myself. If everyone carried a firearm on them, everywhere they went..... you think Home Invasions, Theft or Murders would occur quite as often? I don't believe so. Half the scum bags would be dead. Take away our weapons.... and you give criminals the chance to flourish."
2," Gun bans only disarm citizens that are not inclined to commit crimes Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776[8] - ""Laws that forbid the carrying of arms. . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.""

2,"the general public should be able to posses guns for self defense and safety. i agree that there should be some restrictions like if you are a convicted felon you are not aloud to posses a gun. but a citizen trying to protect himself should be able to have a gun. some may say that crime happens because of guns. guns don't kill people, people do. but even if guns were outlawed the criminals would find illegal guns and would find other ways to harm people. all people shouldn't have they're safety taken away just because of what criminals decide to do with the guns."
1,"guns have no purpose other then killing. i do not think all guns should be banned, but definitely some. if you like to hunt, then go out and buy a hunting rifle. however i believe guns such as AK-47's serve no purpose. they are machine guns, and you do not need a machine gun to hunt a deer. as for self defense, well there are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for defense. you could move to a place with a lower crime rate. buy a taser or pepper spray. get an alarm or guard dog. besides, what would you need a gun for to defend yourself? if it is against a robber then i should let you know that most robberies occur when you are away from home, making the gun pointless."
1,"The about 80% of the ""general public"" dont even know a thing about gun safety. Although i agree that criminals should not possess guns, at least most of them know how to use it. Citizens trying to protect themselves should use something that wont kill people with a flick of a finger. Pepper spray can blind, tasers will stop someone wherever they stand, guns click and kill. I said this in jacobs dispute, but if people were the ones killing people then it wouldnt matter if there was a gun involved.Umm heres a visualPerson+Gun= -Person(A person with a gun kills a person)Take out the gun cause your saying its not its fault...Person=-PersonIf the gun wasnt responsible, and its the persons fault, then it wouldnt matter if the gun was there or not. But infact it makes quite the difference. Your point about criminals finding illegal guns is just like illegal guns, something just cant be completely erased. But saying outlawing them would make gun rate increase cause they are illegal makes no logical sense. Take a place like school, we have no guns here, and in cases where shootings happen, its much less then i would be if people had guns everyday. Same goes for a biggerscale like the USA. We also have all been trained with the lock down drill, and im certain the government would issue something like that as well.The people behind the guns ""defending"" themselves are just as trigger happy as any intruder. To just say guns should be aloud because criminals have them, is childish and we need to age past barbaric murder caused by guns."

2,ya brad if the people that the robbers were gonna take hostage have guns they can show them whats up
1,"This comment should be under brads comment instead of on the ""arguments for"" side."
1,"I think that the statement of ""Guns kill people. Guns kill children"" is totally true. But people try and tell you that its the person that uses the gun to kill that people and the children or they could have a mental disease that makes them do it and then later they don't understand what they did. Wrong. I think that if somebody is mental, they should even get a gun. I feel that only police and other people in that group of upper class people like that should be the only ones with guns and weapons like that. Well what about the defense of people? What if you get robbed and he has a weapon (not a gun) and you have nothing to defend yourself because of this law. Well that sucks (: No with less guns getting robbed shouldn't be a big deal... Use a frying pan or something to protect yourself or better yet call the cops. But guns do kill people and children, yes it is fair that police and upper class or that enforcement get guns (they need them and use them for a purpose). THE RIGHTS FOR GUN SHOULD BE LIMITED FOR THE PEOPLE THAT USE THEM FOR THE BAD REASONS AND GIVE THEM TO THE PEOPLE THAT USE THEM FOR GOOD REASONS TO HELP AND SAVE PEOPLES LIVES (:"
1,"Guns are bad period. Dont assume that ""the upperclass"" are any less capable of using them in a corrupted fashion.Remember human nature is human nature. No-one is exempt from human nature.Time has proved again and again Anyone is capable of snapping."
1,We should protect gun laws because of crazy people who go out of control with them and guns these days are getting more advanced and easier to get
2,"That person does not look crazy at all, he appears to be a person who happens to like guns and is responsible enough to go to a shooting range.By taking away guns from the average citizen you are only allowing the criminals easy access seeing as they will not give up their guns."
2,"Cities that have gun ban laws enacted are not significantly safer The examples of Washington DC and New York show that with a gun ban law they are one of the most dangerous cities within the US. This leads to the conclusion that reality should have reinforced the reasoning that gunning bans  provides more safety to the public. Absent of this confirmation one can argue that banning guns is not an effective way of ensuring public safety.""
"
1,People abuse gun rights to rob places and take hostages. people say that you need guns to protect yourself but do you really have time to find your gun if you are taken hostage. usualy the people commiting the crime are more prepared and ready to strike
2,"Psst, criminals don't plan on following gun laws, so banning guns will not prevent robberies or crimes."
2,"if you need to take the ""time to find your gun if you are taken hostage"" i surely hope you do not have a gun and more importantly have anyone who would do something bad if they found it."
1,"Student News Daily offers lots of policial stamensts about popular topic today. In a chart compairing Conservitive and Liberal views, there was the following quote; ""The Second Amendment gives no individual the right to own a gun, but allows the state to keep a militia (National Guard). Guns kill people. Guns kill children.""For example, during a year when over 5,000 teens and children died from gun wounds in the USA, in Great Britain, where gun ownership is very restricted, 19 teens and children died from gun wounds. This is very blunt statistic proof that states that gun control thats rectricted to certian personal keep citizens safe and reduces the death by guns. With society and technology proggressing at such a fast speed, the need for barbaric uses of protections such as guns is not nessicary. Guns can be unpredictable and almost 84% of americans have not been trained in gun safety. With the uses of modern day technoloy for individual protection, gun control should only be restriced to select forces of the goverment who are trained in using these weapons.A huge part of american culture is film, and if you were to ask people if violence and special effects involiving guns and other firing weapons were nessicary to a good film, one out of two would say yes. This point gets even more drastic then a 50/50 when i comes to videos games, once you past rated ""E"" there it is almost impossible to find a game with no use of guns. Taking gun use as a ""game"" only provokes the wrong use of these weapons and teaches the brian that guns can be an ""easy way or"" or a ""simple defense"". Not only do adults play games, so do children. My 11 year old brother is a avid player of the new first person shooter Modern Warfare2. This game is fast paced and above all violent, take a look in the video below.Modern Warefare may ahve the rating M but its very common for children to play these games. Some may argue that these ""train to be future military member"" but how does jamming down the ""x"" button until 2 in the moring make you a good soilder in training? Simple anwser, it doesn't. We cannot have guns in the same enviorment as play. Teaching people that firing a gun gives you points is not what they should know. Firing that gun kills another human being and will haunt you for the rest of your life.Infact you may have heard about how many soilders who come back from the war suffer from many phycological issues that in many cases cannot be completely cured. We should leave the guns to the people who need to use them. We as citizens need to be protected, not be armed. To keep the country both mentally and physically safe, we need to keep reality and virtual gaming seperate to keep are country togather. We need to restrict gun control."
1,I think that we should all have the right to own a gun because most people use then for protection or hunting so we should and people that dont use then for that reason might just have then to just have then
1,"""Guns are needed for self defense."" Ive heard this so many times reading peoples pro-gun-rights stories, so to start of this argument against such a childish idea, let me give you a real and recent example. Saturday, October 10, 2009,Associated Press""Right now everything points to a tragic accident,"" Police Chief Kevin Brunelle told The Associated Press, adding investigators were awaiting forensic results.John Tabutt, 62, told investigators he got his gun when he thought he heard an intruder, then fired at a figure in the hallway, according to Brunelle. It was Tabutt's live-in fiancee, 62-year-old Nancy Dinsmore, who family members say he was going to marry Saturday. Tabutt told authorities he thought she was next to him in bed the whole time."" - At this time please click the link at the bottom of this page and view the news video of the tragic 911 call. If you dont want to view the video, dont bother reading this. - Its traumatic accidents like that, that prove why using guns for defense, is dangerous no matter what. If that man had just tased the ""intruder"" they could still be alive and happily married. Some people may call this a one time accident, but people think of guns almost by default as necessary to self-defense. Infact all of the people ""for"" gun-rights used that idea and phrased it as the only way. But in no way is something as deadly as that gun, the only way. Our school is a gun free environment, or better phrased, has gun control. Do students feel safe? Yes, because guns are not allowed so the fear of being shot is alot less. Could a gun be entered into a school? Yes but if it was fired, we have designated lockdown drills we have practiced and one schools shooting kills lots less then if we were to have guns everyday.Think of america as an environment with guns available everyday. Imagine how many lives would be taken due to anger or other temporary emotional disabilities. We cant keep amusing the worst of everyone around us. ""They have guns, so we need guns as well to protect ourselves."" Two wrongs like in that statement do not make a right. If everyone had gun control, wed have a ""school"" type of environment and while ""schools shootings"" or gun use in a gun-controlled setting would still occur, its much, much less then if we were all having guns on ourselves as ""Defense"". We have come to a time when technology and idealisms are advancing, so should our policy on gun control. Self defense should just keep one safe, not kill off other humans. Innocent ones like a wife to be, or a robber who is just down on his luck. They are fellow humans, we shouldn't even get the change to flick and finger and fire a bullet at them. Especially when something as common as pepper spray and your pet rottweiler could keep you safer."
2,"So your argument against people owning guns is that since some people might make stupid mistakes then it is okay to punish everyone?With that logic we might as well ban cars because some people will get in wrecks from being bad drivers, ban alcohol because some people drink too much, and ban kitchen utensils because some people stab themselves."
1,"This is a high school debate, for a history class, anyone not in it like yourself is banned and anyone else floating in here and reading this don't bother typing you are not a high school student and need to find something else to busy yourself with that interrupting out education activity. Thank you"
2,"You shouldn't use your schools "" gun-free enviroment"" as an argument. It doesn't hold much weight. When I was in school... do you know how many drug deals I saw take place in my school (and took place in...-snicker-)? Did you also know my school was (still is) a drug-free enviroment? It's quite amusing actually.....what comforts people's minds. It's the simple things. You can paint the world whatever color you want. It's still a cruel world. It's still full of thieves and murderers. You can make yourself as vulnerable as you want. I'll make myself as protected as I can."
1,I recommend you get sober or take a happy pill and stop debating with high schoolers who can form better thoughts then you.
2,"The handgun ban prevents law abiding citizens from self defense The present large amount of guns within the US society and the even larger black market of guns provides the proof that inevitably post any banning of guns  they will still be present in society. Their existence will be confined to an illegal paradigm where law abiding citizens will not have access. That will put them at the risk of loosing their lives by being without means of self-protection.
"
1,"""guns kill people"" that is wat we have to remember. I mean NOONE should have a gun. That enforces that people kill one anouther."
2,"Guns play a huge role in intimidation as well. If I am strapped for cash and decide that the only way to make any money would be to rob somebody, I think I'd rather rob a store without a gun than a store with a gun. They can be used for bad things, but legal guns are typically used for good or for protection from illegal guns."
2,"ok then.So do cars, trains, boats, planes, stoves, showers, bathtubs, ....uh wait a sec...did you mean that people can use guns to kill people?My bad!"
1,Guns are very easy to get and anyone can use them to kill people.
1,"people kill people, but guns make it a heck of a lot easier. i do not think all guns should be banned, but some should. if you like to hunt, and you want to kill a deer, then go out and by a hunting rifle. however, certain guns are overkill such as AK-47's. i do not think you need a machine gun to kill a deer. you may say that guns could be used for personal protection, however i think buying a gun for that reason is stupid and paranoid because there are so many other things you can do before resorting to a gun for protection. you could move to a place with a lower crime rate, or by a taser/ pepper spray. you could get a guard dog, but the main idea is that there is little purpose for guns other than their use for killing, and that is why i am against gun rights."
1,"this is gonna piss my hubby off completely, but I'm against it. gonna break into MY home? watch the fuck out because i got my psycho-reflex-reaction to throw, along with some heavy decor,you'd wanna hope i ain't in the middle of ironing motherfuckers,this is my home get the fuck out....get my drift.....get some balls, not a gun. My lack of tolerance for asshole behavior by asshole people is the reasons why people should not be allowed guns.areshole behavior offends me and makes me snap and if i had a gun, and you threatened ME,i wouldn't kill you, ha ha ha id tie you up and hurt you lots instead.yes you wanted to come into MY home remember.See I'm a good reason why we shouldn't have guns.I once new an asshole,I'm talking heavy,with a heavy gang and lackeys up his arse for support, while held against my will for four days, tried to insist i learn how to use his double barrel sawn off shotgun. I'm a five-foot-four,size 10 woman.what was this dick head thinking? the following day the asshole and 1 of his lackeys forced me to enter somewhere with them and then because this organized gang weren't organized at all they decided to wait til it was dark again before leaving, the two idiots thought they'd take a nap while waiting for time to pass. i was packing shit as i crept on my knees, to the bag that sat on the floor beside the snoring asshole,the bag that held the gun they insisted i learn how to use the day before.but then i thought better & just rode it out. there was no way i would have been able to pull off what i was thinking.if they knew id even had thought about it they would kill me. but now if they ever find out and come for me again ..i know just how to deal with those assholes,i Learnt from the best-them!...p.s now about that taser,now thats good clean fun."
1,"might i add we have gun laws here in australia,not so long ago we had an gun amnesty. unfotunately due to some corruption,not the majority,but a lot of those guns were sold back to criminals."
1,"what im saying here is that we have to be very careful when it comes to this subject of a gun amnesty, as they may take your guns, but then corrupt law members then may give them to some quite nasty organised crime syndicates.For those who want to blindly say the law would not do something like that, then you are not allowing for the strongest existing element- HUMAN NATURE."
1,"Absolutely they should be banned. There are almost no cases where an innocent person has defended themselves with a gun. And sure guns don't kill people, but the death rate would definately go down if people did not have easy access to weapons. I mean look at the VT incident. A college kid, with a clearly bad background record, managed to buy guns and ammo. We outlaw gun's and stuff like that does not happen"
2,"Wrong! Last year 2.5 million people were saved by using a gun for self defense. I don't consider that ""almost no cases where an innocent person has defended themselves."""
2,"The handgun ban is ineffective at stopping handguns homicides According to the statements of the DC police that an overwhelmingly amount of the homicides have been committed with handguns. This goes to show that even though the law has been enforced the harms have still occurred through the inevitable availability of guns.

2,"i dont even see it could come across the mind of any intelligent person that people who are innocent dont use guns to defend themselves, thats like saying if someone broke into your house to rob you and they didnt know you were there that they wouldnt want to kill you therefore having a gun could protect you from a scared criminal."
2,probama it would still happen you F*ing moron if they arent afraid of going to prison for killing people they definately wouldnt be afraid to get a gun illegaly.

2,Guns are illegal in Chicago.How do you explain Chicago having the highest homicide rate?Don't worry... I'll wait.
1,"Where'd you read that? The NRA Newsletter?Highest gun related death per capita: DC, where guns are legal linkLowest gun related death per capita: Hawaii, where guns are illegal linkAnd see Xaeon's arguement below.Chicago is like 15 on the list. link And considering the poverty rate, and that it's the 3rd largest city (and probably the second most dense) that's actually not bad."
2,"I find your argument inadequate, circumstantial and irrelevant, comparing overall homicide rates to ""gun related"" deaths.Chicago is 15 on the list because it's sorted alphabetically... :/BTW, Hawaii's figures rival those of Chicago according to that same list.Of course the lowest gun related deaths will be in the the states where guns are banned, duh.Lowest bun not nonexistent.DC's highest gun deaths per capita coincidences with the fact that guns are legal there, doesn't mean anywhere guns are legal crime rates will be high.Plus the DC area has fewer population so the 'per capita' figure will naturally tend to be higher.Still it does nothing to counter MBurke12's argument."
1,"Actually, if you read the chart I gave you, you'll see that Chicago is ranked 15th. No, that's not just the order it is listed in.Burke's arguement is specifically that places where guns are illegal has more gun deaths. That's his arguement. That's the arguement I answered. That chart shows conclusively that the opposite is true.The graph is based on per capita, so that DC has less people is completely irrevelant. You do know what per capita means don't you? That means it's taking into consideration the population.You are just going to have to face the fact that places where guns are legal, have more gun related deaths.That's the arguement Burke put forth. That's the arguement I rebutted. And the facts show conclusively that I am correct.I'm not sure what your arguement is at all."
2,"Look at some European countries that banned guns. Guess what nothing has changed. If people want to kill they will and they will find a way to get a gun to do so! So you want to get rid of hunting, which is a trillion $ a year industry and if you ban guns millions of jobs would be lost. YOU THINK WE ARE IN A RECESSION NOW! You idiot!"
1,"In case you different do other research, Chicago has one of the highest crime rates in the entire country. Crime rates equals criminals which means if guns are illegal, they must be getting them from somewhere, hmmm, i wonder where, black market or illegal selling across borders anyone?"
2,"Studies that have showed the  murder rate has decreased were flawedThe methodology of the studies has proven to be flawed. This goes to show that when arguments are supported by studies that support that the murder rate has decreased their validity and reliability is undermined by a flawed methodology.
"
2,"Have you actually read the newspaper? There are several cases and some that a gun prevented them from being a dead victim. I speak from experience. As for the easy access of guns, criminals would have access to guns in the black market regardless if they banned guns. Cocaine is illegal but some how people still gain access to it...well, how does that happen?"
2,"Well look at prohibtion in 1919 and on, also known as the Volstead act. Alcohol was completely banned yet everybody still drank. They found ways to drink. People had to brew underground, and drink in underground bars, but it happened. Even major Authorities including police and judges were found down there. The same things would happen with guns, and who would be the people to illegally own guns? Not harmless hunters, but gangsters and other criminals who are dangerous with such weapons. It is still going to happen. Maybe we just need tighter gun laws when purchasing them."
2,If we outlaw guns that stuff will still happen because they are already illegally getting guns.
2,ever since we put registration on guns and making guns harder to get school shooting started. we need to allow students to carry concealed guns on campus. with the VT shooting if one student had been allowed to carry a gun on them the shooter would have ended it early and many people would still be alive today. it needs to be a law that we enforce to make every home have at least on gun to protect your self
2,"1,145 times a day handguns are used against robbers. 416 times each day women use their handguns to protect themselves from rapists. Overall, a gun in the home is 216 times more likely to be used in self defense than to cause the death of an innocent victim. And even if you don't own a gun, preserving the right of your neighbors to own them is one of the best ways to keep criminals out of your neighborhood."
2,hey i agree but where did you get your facts from...............................................................
2,just because you make it illegal to buy a gun you will never and i mean never get all the guns off the street because the import guns illegally they buy guns without ffa regulation and peple are not stupid and they will find a way to make themselves weapons such as the book writtem by Bill Holmes published in 2002 titled .50-Caliber Rifle Construction Manual
2,if a robber came in your house you would want a gun.
1,"Actually, no I wouldn't.If a robber came into my house in an area where gun ownership is legal, I'd have to seriously consider whether or not this person is also going to have a gun; why would they enter my house unarmed if they knew that chances were that I would have a gun? All this is going to do is cause a shootout, with most likely someone (50% chance it's me) getting shot.I'd rather hand over my stuff (it's just stuff), claim on the insurance afterwards and have a greatly reduced risk of ending up dead."
2,"So let me get this straight... Home invasions almost always means that they are just there for your stuff, that means that they are not going to rape your wife and daughter in front of you while you're tied to a chair then kill all 3 of you after they get their kicks then take your stuff? Uh, who's going to collect the insurance? Probably whoever is not at home durring that time I guess, or some other family members currently not living there right?"
2,"The DC handgun ban has not really decreased crime and murders in DC. Since the handgun ban was first implemented in 1976, more than 8,400 people have been murdered in the district. This is a fairly dramatic figure and demonstrates that the ban has not had a substantive effect in reducing crime rates.
"
1,"""Home invasions almost always means that they are just there for your stuff.""Actually, yes. Thousands of burglaries happen every day, and I'm sure in a lot of cases they happen when people are at home. There are not, however, thousands of the scenario you described. So, yes, home invasion almost always means that they are there for your stuff.""Uh, who's going to collect the insurance?""If they were to burgle my house, then me. I'd buy some nice shiny new shit, and enjoy it knowing that I didn't get shot in the face because I tried to be a hero."
2,If someone breaks into a home the homeowner almost always has the advantage. They know the layout of their house better than whoever is breaking in. when it comes to real-life applications the chances of you geting shot are way less than 50-50. Look it up
2,Banning guns wouldn't bring down gun violence significantly because people who are committing gun crimes are getting their guns illegally in the first place. And other countries that have banned guns have alot more variables to consider besides just banning guns alone. most other countries have a much tighter justice system that doesn't give any wiggle room for crimes in general let alone gun crimes.
1,"i do not think all guns should be banned, but certainly some. if your a hunter and you want to kill a deer, then go and by a rifle, but do you really need an AK-47 to kill a little deer? and if your buying a gun for protection, then that is just stupid. there are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for protection. get a guard dog, buy an alarm, or move near a place with a lower crime rate. you could also buy a taser or pepper spray."
1,"The second amendment wasnt for people to start killing each other, it was for the creation of the militia. Guns in America, are supposed to keep this world a better place, however, it doesnt do that at all, it only allows criminals to commit crimes. It definetly doesnt protect anyone from anything, it only harms the people of this country. And yea, I get that many people save themselves from the criminals that break into their house or try to rape them, but half the time thats not the case."
1,"well if guns were banned stupid people would not be able to get the guns and kill the other people.Yeah, maybe you did not see when you wrote the ""stupid people WITH"" part. ban the damn things ban them all."
2,"HUNTING AND SELF-DEFENSE, time to look past your little inner city cocoon. There is a big place called the rest of North America!"
2,"""The british aren't going to invade, so we don't need to protect ourselves"". So when an american enters you're home with intent to kill, are you going to defend yourself with a fork? I do agree that most burglary's that occur do not involve a murder or serious injury, but not all home invasion's are with the intent to remove your property. If I we're in the position to put my life on the line, or lose a television, I would rather lose the television. The question is whether this person is here to steal my property or harm me or my family. I would rather have the means to protect myself and my family. If we lived in a perfect world where we didn't have Poverty, Drugs and Poor Education, then maybe I could see youre point. The fact of the matter is we don't. When America gets to the point where I can go to sleep at night, or even go about my daily business and not worry, then I'll consider getting rid of my gun. Until then, we live in a dangerous world where people live outside the law and I feel safe knowing theres an amendment granting me the right to defend myself."
2,"Shot guns are used for many different application a few of which are bird hunting like pheasant or ducks, they can also be used for trap and skeet shooting. Another thing shotguns have a maximum shot distance of 30 yards so they aren't that good of a weapon. Also semi-automatic weapons have various uses and when you are hunting fast animals you want to be able to take as many shots as possible without having to cock the gun. Another point is that a gun is a tool and the person is the one who kills someone not the gun. And it is now required to take firearm safety to purchase or use a gun and also 80% of guns used in crimes are bought illegally according to the FBI."
1,yes because some people in America cannot be trusted with one i understand that if its for your protection then yeah go ahead and have one but I'm just saying most crimes happen with handguns.
2," The US 2nd Amendment does not merely protect a right to arms in militias 
"
2,"The DC handgun ban is made ineffectual by legal purchases in Maryland and Virginia. DC is very small and very close to Maryland and Virginia, making it very easy for people to legally purchase guns outside of DC and bring them in. It also makes it very easy for blackmarket sales to occur.

1,"i don't think we should ban all guns, but certainly some. if you want to hunt, then go ahead a buy a hunting rifle, but what if the purpose of a gun other then that. getting one for protection is stupid since there are many other options you have before resorting to a gun for protection. think about getting an alarm, moving to a low crime area, or buying a guard dog. i think guns such as AK-47's are overkill and should be banned. do you really need a machine gun to kill a little deer?"
1,"everybody is talking about how the government is going to take over, and guns will be the only way to protect ourselves. it sounds like some bad movie premise. how has the government taken over exactly, and what is so bad if it did? i mean isn't a nation supposed to be run by a government? if we were under the control of a tyrant, then i could understand, but we live in a democracy. we choose our leaders, and can impeach them if we do not like them. it is not a perfect system i know, but it ensures that no person can take control of our country. even if somebody did, then do you really think a gun is going to be you saving grace? if there was a so called tyrant, then he probably has taken over the militia, and do you think that you would win against a trained solider who probably has better weapons."
2,"Alternative measures can be taken in place of a ban to stem crime and murder. There are a range of ways to decrease gun crime and murder in a city, including greater background checks, making sure that bad people don't get guns, more police patrols, and various other alternatives. These steps should be taken before a ban, as a ban may be much more intrusive into the constitutional rights of citizens. 
"
1,"Yes guns should be banned in America. In the UK, deaths by guns are a lot lower. The reason is that it's still harder for the average man in the street to obtain a gun. The American Constitution states ""The right to bear arms"" and the Americans seem to feel really strongly about protecting this right. Obviosly the constitution is held in high esteem to the Americans, based on their history and pride of independence. However you can't hold onto values and laws that have lost their importance or value. At the time of the American Declaration of Independance, which, I imagine would have led to the drawing up of the rules in the constitution, life and times were completely different. Shootings and murder were everywhere, and if I was George Washington writing a proclamation for a new world, then it makes perfect sense to give the citizens of this new world, the right to defend their land, property, and life. And for this reasons Americans have guns. But, if you can't get hold of one, you can't kill someone with it. It's a simple argument really, guns kill."
2,"FINALLY. Someone who pointed out that violent crimes in Europe ARE HIGHER. Good lord. Stop listening to propaganda. In fact BBC recently did a report on how crime has gotten worse.Get y'alls head out of the sand. Europe's moving away from government intervention. Were moving toward it. Europe's starting to realize that gun control fails. Were moving towards it. Why do we not look across the pond and realize how much it sucks? High crime, and high unemployment."
2,"Uhhh? You ever heard of a black market, the illegal selling,buying, and distribution of contraband (weapons,drugs) illegally?"
2,shut up you commie before i show you what a responsible gun owner can do!!! you#%&@%
1,"Do you realize your talking about empires, which existed hundreds of years ago, when there weren't ""hardcore"" gangsters and a black market, people abided by the rules or wouldnt have life."
2,"Outlaw guns, then only outlaws will have guns."
2,"[event]The society with no guns has five members that buy guns from the black market, they take over the society and create a dictatorship where the men are forced into slave labor camps and the women are sold as sex slaves. Meanwhile the other society is fine they have had a few disputes with a bad apple or two but they were both resolved without the collapse of the society.[/event]coming back to the planet earth you must first accept that guns exist. If you ban them there will still be a black market, no matter if they are smuggled or made domestically. So the best solution is to regulate and make sure law abiding citizens can buy guns."
1,And freedom can be lost with guns in the wrong hands. It works both way.
2,"Key word: ""in the wrong hands."" Yeah its possible for a maniac to get ahold of a gun, but its also possible for a maniac to get in the drivers seat of a car. (see my post)Perhaps we should ban cars in America?"
2,I meant that I wanted guns to be kept in the right hands. I did not mean that I wanted guns to be banned.
2," A handgun ban deprives citizens of the most commonly used weapon for self defense The handgun is used more commonly than any other weapons in self defense in the home. Roughly 80 percent of all self-defense occurs with handguns, according to some sources.[9] This is because it is small, can be easily stowed in a house where it may be of need, and because it is easy to wield and fire. To ban a weapon that is so important in self-defense would reduce the capacity of citizens to defend themselves, making citizens more vulnerable, and possibly inviting further robberies.  
"
2,"Oh, thats cool, I agree. Sorry bout that."
2,Guns should be banned everywhere except America.
2,we need guns!! how else are we gonna shoot people that dont agree with us!!
2,pure genius!!!!!!!!
2,"For all of you who want guns to be illegal ask your self this what will our army do without guns. Oh I know they will spit at eachother. Its funny how quick people are to say lets make guns illegal because their bad are they really that bad last time i checked it takes two hands a finger and a willing PERSON to use it. Just like how ignorant people say pit bulls are a deadly dog and should all be extermanated well so are bear and lions and tigers. Its not the animal that was trained to kill people. People train dogs to kill People. Now if this were a math equation People added to Killing equalls People Killing People hence the saying guns dont kill people, people kill people. Tell me Im wrong and ill call you and idot there is no argument for that statement none. Ignorance is what makes stupid and somtimes i see too much of it. California is the best place for it."
2,"Banning guns will not make gun-related deaths decline substantially. The majority of gun buyers are law-abiding people who keep the guns for self defense. Guns used in street crimes, especially from gangs, are typically illegal. If guns are banned, the illegal street guns will still be circulated, but the innocent people will not be able to obtain a gun for self-defense."
2,Guns save lives! If we were to ban guns the only people that will have guns are the people we were trying to take them away from. People already are able to get guns illegally and will continue to if they are banned. I will always feel safer with a gun knowing that criminals can get guns illegally.
2,Guns kill peope; just like spoons made Rosie O'Donnel fat.
2,One of the many reasons those men signed the Declaration of Independence.
2,Guns don't kill people. People kill people. Guns assist people.
1,"Banning one class of arms does not violate an individual right to bear arms An individual right to bear arms can be interpreted to mean that individuals have the right to bear arms of some kind, but not necessarily every kind. Most would see bazookas as a class of arms that should not be widely held. But, this does not limit the right of individuals to bear other arms. Similarly, banning handguns will not limit the ability of individuals to bear a rifle or shotgun. Therefore, a ban on handguns only limits the right to bear arms, but does not seriously impair it.  
"
2,"Guns don't kill people, poeple kill people. The vast majority of people who commit gun crimes obtain their wepons illegally in the first place, so if guns are taken from the law abideing citizens, you'll have a situation where the outlaws will have guns and the sane people who should be allowed to have guns will be defenseless. also it shifts the balance of power in favor of the politicians instead of the citizenry. It's just one more step towards tyranny. This country started by shooting the poeple who tried to supress us. We can't allow our government to become the very thing we killed to escape from in the first place. Do you really want the politicians to have complete control of you lives?"
2,"guns dont kill people, people kill people, from a gunsdont kill people i do corperation"
2,"we would gain nothing from banning guns in america. guns are dangerous when people illegally use them why would we ban guns in america? to stop the violence and all the killings linked to them correct? and if killing people is already illegal what good is it going to do to make guns illegal. If you are willing to kill some one you probably don't care what you are killing then with is legal or not. The only people banning guns in america would hurt are the people that are defending there homes, business's, families. Since guns are already a lucrative black market making them illegal would make it worst. just like banning alcohol did to this nation. look how much money that made the mob it brought them into power. what do you guys think a black market surplus do?"
2,"All we need is good gun control. And by ""good gun control"" I mean two hands on the gun ;)"
2,on behalf of my hubby..............................................have  an upvote!...he liked this one.;)
2,Thanks. Here on CD I aim to please (just like in the bathroom). ;)
2,no if you have a guns license
2,as long as people who have guns use they responsibly they should never be banned
2,"no guns should not be baned in america and no we should not be able 2 carry fully automatic, but if a person tries to hurt you or your family unless you are a sharpshooter then a single shot wepon will not be good enough to protect you or your family. so a semi-automatic wepon can be good to have around the house."
2,"Guns dont kill people, people kill people. People sometimes kill other people innocently a lower percentage of the time but yes it is there. It is called self defense. If someone breaks into your house and you shoot and kill that man is that a bad thing? Also if it is not guns then it will be homemade bombs or just kitchen knives. It would be almost impossible to ban just like the alchohol ban the US gov tried. It wont work in the southern states I gurantee it. Most of the 16 year olds and higher that I KNOW own a gun . at least 25% of them. Which means that they are already toting illegaly so if they are already how is the gov gonna enforce it if they are already having KIDS slip under the radar?"
1,"Since other gun classes have been banned, so too can handguns for reasonable ends. There is a precedent for banning citizens from purchasing specific gun classes, such as fully-automatic weapons and heavy weaponry such as grenades and bazookas. It is, therefore, not reasonable to argue that it is unconstitutional to ban a class of arms such as handguns; it has already been done and is not disputed in many cases (such as with bazookas). The question, therefore, is simply whether banning handguns fits the reasonableness standard in the District of Columbia.
"
2,"You can kill someone with a car, should cars be banned in america?"
2,"No they shouldn't. If you take away the civilian's only right to self defense, how are they suppose to defend themselves from the criminals who buy weapons and drugs from the black market illegally. If you think homicide rates are high now, if gun control becomes active, that will sky rocket."
2,"No, firearms are simply made available for self-defense, the percentage of people that use them for other purposes is a very small one. Except in L.A. hehe"
2,"Just people kill people. Children would not wonder what a gun does if they are exposed to guns and people tell them the proper way to use them. Its the children who are shielded from guns that try to play with them and don't know what to do, that cause trouble."
2,Even if guns were banned poeple could still make there own guns.
2,"Should [citizen] guns be banned?- hell no.In an arguement made by T.S. Eggleston, if guns were banned, a black market would arise as well as gun smuggling. This in return would lead to an increase in crime and honestly, who wants more crime? He states that the citizens with no previous criminal records would surrender their guns to officials, leaving them helpless and at a higher risk for being injured.Eggleston further explains that ""Criminals will always continue to break the law and prey on the law-abiding but disarmed citizens.""For the previous arguements that claim ""there are almost no cases where an innocent person has defended themselves with a gun.""Thats bull. According to Eggleston and other statistics, ""every 13 seconds, an American uses a legal firearm in defense against a criminal.""So, for self-protection, guns should remain legal. It prevents overcrowding of prisons, riots, and decreases many injuries. In return health costs are not forced to sky-rocket.To suit the people that believe guns should be completely illegal....I do feel that stricter laws need to be enforced to acquire such equipment.According to the National Rifle Association (NRAILA), in the state of Texas, an individual does not need a permit to buy a hangun, and they are not required to carry registration or a license.This lack of legislation is one of the main reasons for the decrease in gun safety, so if we fix this, Americans can be on their way to a happy, gun legal society.=]http://www.the-eggman.com/writings/gun_ban.html http://www.the-eggman.com/index.phphttp://crime.about.com/od/gunlawsbystate/a/gunlaws_tx.htm"

2,Studies have shown (look at cities in Australia) that when you disarm a population crime rates go up because people no longer have the fear of people defending themselves.

2," ""Arms"" falling under the 2nd Amendment can be regulated but not banned United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. March 9th, 2007 court decision against the DC handgun ban. - ""Once it is determined - as we have done - that handguns are 'Arms' referred to in the Second Amendment, it is not open to the District to ban them ... That is not to suggest that the government is absolutely barred from regulating the use and ownership of pistols. The protections of the Second Amendment are subject to the same sort of reasonable restrictions that have been recognized as limiting, for instance, the First Amendment.""
"
2,"Guns don't kill people. People kill people. So you guys think that since guns kill people, we should ban those, right? Knives kill people too, should they be banned? We cut our meat with knives so no. We kill animals and eat their meat with guns so no we shouldn't ban guns."
1,"i do not think all guns should be banned, but certainly some. guns used for hunting are fine, but they do not serve any purpose other then that. guns such as AK-47's should be band because they are overkill. do you really need a machine gun to kill a little deer. kind of like how some knives such as switchblades are banned because they serve little purpose."
2,"Not exactly disagreeing with your argument, but guns can also be used for personal safety. Not just for killing ""little deer""."
1,"the are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for safety. i have said this many times. move to a place with a low crime rate, get an alarm, or buy a guard dog. you could also buy a taser or pepper spray. buying a gun for protection is just stupid and paranoid. who would you even be protecting yourself from anyway? a burglar, because most burglaries occur when your not even home, make the gun pointless."
2,guns just help people kill each other but its not the guns fault it has no control of its self people choices to use the gun in crime
2,"There was a reason we the people created the 2nd ammendment, the right to bear arms. We created it so if the government went tyranical on the people, the people will have a way to defend themsleves and try to overthrow the government. If guns were banned in America, it would leave the citizens helpless against the government."
2,"What's the government made of? People. What's the military made of? People. What's all of America made of? People. If we can trust our government and military with automatic weapons, tanks, and explosives to defend our country, why is it we can't rely on the people of America to defend themselves?There is only ONE cop for every 2000 people in the U.S. I believe. Congress itself said that it is not their duty to defend us as individuals, only as a whole, which is unapplicable when it comes to a robbery, rape, or murder.Every human has the right to live. However, a ""human"" with a sick intent of murdering, raping, and maiming with long list of such words, is hardly what I would call a human. I call them a monster. Think, do you believe Hitler had a right to live? What about the 911 terrorists? What about Seung-Hui Cho, who laughed as he shot his victims at Virginia Tech?The average response time for cops is a minimum of 5 minutes, with no definite maximum quota. It only takes about 5 seconds for a crime to happen, and much less for someone to be stabbed or shot to death.Wouldn't you think if criminals have guns, you should in fact have one to defend yourself should you ever become a victim? You anti-gun people bash on gun owners who prey on the defenseless people. You, as a person against guns, are in fact helpless too, but you do not have to be. It is not complicated, guns do not take superior skill to use if they make murder so easy. I'm part of a shooting program, and in only 3 hours they taught kids as young as 7 how to safely handle weapons, and never in the 50+ years it's been around has there been an accident.Someone once told me, ""If you give the criminal what he wants, he won't kill you."" Yeah really, as if EVERY criminal was after your money. Criminals have different intents, anywhere from your money to your life. Your life is a potential target no matter what the intent is. Would you rather be mangled, mutilated, and murdered or have to explain why you shot that thug in the chest? Do not misinterpret this, but there are criminals that exist who do not wish to even harm someone. However, what right and reason would they have to steal from you, scare you, threaten your life, and maybe even kill you?Another thing someone told me, ""Dude you have no chance without a gun, even with one you only have about a 3% chance."" Bullsh*t. Even if it really was a 3% chance, I think I'd rather have that 3% chance to live than nothing, even the smallest percent is MORE THAN ENOUGH.If guns are banned, do any of you think criminals or ""law abiding"" citizens will abide by it?Though they may be faulty, some criminals know how to manufacture their own guns. Despite being faulty, they are still guns, and they can still kill. Therefore, in a society with outlawed weapons, a massive black market will arise with criminally manufactured weapons and weapons that already exist. The same thing is going on for marijuana, cocaine, and meth, and the method of sale and purchase is no different for guns. How? Because drugs are illegal, and if guns are too, then they will just be circulated the exact same way.Clearly we can't trust our the people and criminals with guns, but we can trust them to follow the laws? We would ultimately create more criminals because a majority of the 90 million gun owners like myself would not abide by it.If guns are banned, it wouldn't prevent suicide. People will just start hanging themselves or drive off a cliff. I don't believe everyone should have a gun. Law-abiding citizens who know how to use it should. By no means should anyone who is mentally insane, a felon, or simply ignorant be able to use one. Keep in mind anti-gun people complain about accidents or tragedies that happen because someone didn't know how to use a gun. You are, in fact, one of those people who does not know how to use a gun. Therefore, you are helpless, ignorant, and have no right to tell people who do know how to use guns what to do."

1, USE Both Hands!
1,"The DC gun ban does not violate 2nd amendment because DC is not a state In the opinion of the dissenting judge in the DC handgun ban court decision, the Second Amendment cannot apply to DC, since DC is not a state. Judge Henderson's dissenting opinion - ""To sum up, there is no dispute that the Constitution, case law and applicable statutes all establish that the District is not a State within the meaning of the Second Amendment. Under United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. at 178, the Second Amendment's declaration and guarantee that ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"" relates to the Militia of the States only. That the Second Amendment does not apply to the District, then, is, to me, an unavoidable conclusion."" In other words, DC residents do not have the protection of the Second Amendment, as citizens of other states do, making a ban on handguns acceptable. This is even if we conclude that the Second Amendment provides protections to citizens of states that would make a handgun ban unconstitutional, which is debatable.
"
1," Most handguns purchased for home protection are (1) stolen and used in other crimes, (2) used by children to accidentally kill each other, or (3) used by the owner to commit suicide. In less than 1% of cases do gun owners successfully prevent a home crime with a gun.  />   /> So, while freedom is great, in the real world gun-freedom just kills innocent people."
1," Gun control laws such as minors can't buy them, criminals can't buy them legally.. Those are good gun control laws. Taking away guns is not going to stop people from killing each other. If I wanted to kill someone, I could stick my pencil alongside their eyeball and they would die. I could put a detonator in a bag of chicken manure and blow up a whole car full of people, should we outlaw chicken manure?"
1," I agree with cephus. Gun control is a good thing. We do need to know how many guns are in circulation, who has them, how secure are the weapons and how suitable is the gun holder to have guns.  />   /> The issue as I see it is not about more laws making more killing illegal, it is about the control issues I raised above."
1," You have to have some form of control over guns.  That doesn't mean banning them, it means controlling who has them and making sure we know who has them."
1," I agree with Johnshier. Gun control, if used as it is meant to be used, which is registration, and documentation, is a good idea. However, democrats and liberals take gun control as ""we control all the guns, which means you get none.""  when in the real world, can't and doesn't work, as criminals can and do get guns regardless of gun control laws. And an unregistered weapon in the hands of a criminal is more dangerous than an armed registered citizen."
1," I am against using the vague term of ""Gun Control"" because it is subjective.  /   /> Gun Control means to me:  />   /> -Registering weapons.  /> -Making sure nobody takes registered guns away from citizens.  />   /> The 2nd Amendment states ""a well regulated militia"" is ""necessary to the security of a free State""  />   /> If it's 'regulated' somebody should know.  Black market guns and secret guns aren't regulated.  />   /> In my opinion an unregistered weapon is a serious offense.  Much more offensive would be ignoring constitutional law."
2," Gun control is a good <i sites of mass mruders now, proving that adding laws on top of more laws on top of more laws doesn't effect outlaws because they just disregard them anyway so not only do they still end up killing people but the people they kill have no chance of defending themselves because the law says theyr'e not allowed to carry weapons, let alone fire them."
2," Every smart person should have a gun. Too many stupid people do. If more smart people had guns, more stupid people would be dead or in jail, and our lives would be better."
2," If you make gun control laws you'll only take guns away from good, law abiding citizens.Criminals  don't licence guns anyway.I believe punishment should be harder for owning an illegal gun.That'll discourage criminals from using firearms while still protecting our rights.Plus banning arms is a fashist policy."
2, While I believe gun control is a good thing (use two hands) creating laws only makes it harder for those who liberals say it's OK to have guns get them.  Gun control laws don't stop bad guys from getting guns.  That's why they're called bad guys.  They don't care about the law.  />   /> I think it should be a law that there is a well maintained firearm in every home in America.  Not for any reason other than to shove my principles down someone else's throat for a change.
2," According to the Supreme Court states cannot prohibit people's possession of guns Legal experts argue that the reserved militia that the Second Amendment is comprised of people capable of bearing arms.Under the existence of the Second Amendment a total prohibition of  people's possession of guns will be illegitimate and unconstitutional.

2," I'm for Gun elimination, let the law and   / military have them, the city where the President signs laws is flooded with gun crimes, and that's practically the tour  /> capital of the world, now the murder capital of the country.

2," Guns don't kill people. I DO!!  If our government were to ever fall apart (Jericho, V for Vendetta...) we have the constitutional right to bear arms.  If we get rid of that right we can't protect ourselves from our own government"
2, Making more laws just makes shooting someone more illegal not less common
1," Allowing civilians to have guns allows civilians de facto acceptance to use guns. Allowing them to use guns gives them de facto acceptance into administering the death penalty to stop crimes. I believe only judges and juries should hold this power, not the common man."
1," I agree. The first step would be to harmonize guns laws all across the country. Right now, If I cannot purchase a gun in my state, I can go to a neighbor state and buy it there."
1," Definitely, yes.  / In the UK it is strict, andin most of Europe as well, so i agree, yes."
1," As an American who happens to not like corpses very much, but who does like the Constitution, here is a suggestion:  />   /> 1. Limit private gun ownership to those weapons which would be necessary to defend a home. Handguns and shotguns, I suppose. No full-automatic weapons, no rifles unless homeowner lives in an area where he might encounter a moose in his garage. No weapon sales without accompanying verified property parcel number. It would be a felony to discharge the weapon anywhere other than the registered property or a licensed practice facility. This law would be intended to satisfy the ""home defense"" freedoms of the Constitution. The ""village"" itself is supposedly already defended.  />   /> 2. Sporting weapons would be banished to hunting clubs, or for those who could not afford such clubs, the police station. You could still buy them and use them in legal hunting areas, but you could not keep them at home (unless home was in a legal hunting area). This is designed to limit the damage from accidents and acts of rage; in the U.S., at least, most the weaponry used in mass shootings originated in a private gun locker.  />   /> 3. No private ownership of military-style weapons. No full-auto. No specialized ammunition.  />   /> This is just a general idea, not a comprehensive plan."
1," I agree since I personally the think generally the less guns available, the less gun related crime."
1," It ought to be made much stricter, all the idiots clutching at their guns need to get out of their little bubble."
2,"Constitutional right to bear arms applies to DC residents as much as citizens of other states. Some argue that Washington, DC is not a state, and so the constitutional right to bear arms does not necessarily apply. Yet, DC residents are United States citizens, even if they are not citizens of states. The constitution and the second amendment apply to them as much as to other citizens. The right to bear arms is a right conferred to all US citizens equally, including DC residents. If we assume that the constitution provides an individual right to bear arms, then we should assume that US citizens residing in DC receive the same privilege to exercise this right as do other citizens.
"
1, Americans are obsessed with guns and killing...even the law abiding ones.  Its a mental disorder.
1, Yes because they can always end up in the wrong hands
2," It really is true that guns don't kill people, people kill people. The US and Canada both have traditions of gun ownership, but very different crime rates.  />   /> In the US each year, there are over 30,000 fatal shootings (1 in 10,000 people).   />   /> In Canada, there are less than 1,000 fatal shootings (1 in 40,000).   />   /> There are only 10 million households in Canada, but 7 million guns! Americans are clearly 4 times more violent than Canadians. Why? Whatever the reason, limiting access to guns probably won't deter all the would-be killers out there."
2," We have too many gun laws now as it is. Criminals do not walk into gun shops and purchase guns. Do stricter laws stop dope from being used and sold? The solution to the gun problem is harher penalties for illegal gun use. If a person commits a crime with a gun, they go to jail for life without the possibility of parole. The more people carrying legal firearms, actually lowers crime rates. The criminals do not know who is armed and who is not."
2," What we need is criminal control.  Disarming law abiding citizens was something that Hitler did.  States where concealed carry is the law of the land, criminals don't attack as much."
2, If someone wants to kill someone else obviously they are going to attempt to kill them in some way. If its easier to kill someone with a knife then your fists they will use a knife if its convenient to get. If a guns easier to kill someone then a knife and its convenient to get then they will use a gun. You are right in the sense that if we make it more inconvenient to get guns they will be used less but that does not mean there will be less killings. Also for gun control to work we would have to take guns away from everyone which is against the constitution and i doubt the NGA-national gun association is going to get them up without a fight-legally of course.
2," Bad ppl are going to get guns regardless and stricter laws are not going to change that.  /   /> Let's think this through.  By making gun control law tougher you are restricting hunters and good people from getting them.  Criminal will still get them by breaking into houses, stealing them or other bad ways.  You now have bad people with guns and good people with no way to defend themselves.   Do you know anyone who hunts?  Think first."
2," Let the criminals get firearms. Let their victims get firearms too. Then see who wins. There are more good people than there are criminals. The laws restricting firearm ownership or the right to carry firearms around collectively constitute a criminals' charter. If everyone carried a gun around with them at all times, there would be hardly any crime."
2," This is ridiculous.  No matter what the ""bad guys"" are going to get firearms.  All gun control does is make it harder for the law abiding citizen to get a gun.  Less than 5% of violent crimes committed with a firearm are with a legally purchased firearm.  You're not going to do any good.  You want to see violent crimes go down?  Make it easier for law abiding citizens to buy firearms and train them to use it to defend themselves and others."
1, I agree that gun ownership should be strictly controlled. Put a gun in the hands of a crackpot and there's going to be a problem.
1," If 2nd Amendment aims only at military preparedness, guns should be available for training only Some argue that one of the main purposes of the 2nd amendment is to enable citizens to train with weapons so that they are prepared for military service or the draft. If this is the case, and if the military is fully capable of supplying citizens with guns upon entering the service or being drafted, then it is appropriate to restrict citizen gun-use to training purposes at gun ranges. In this case, there is no need for citizens to own guns, but only the need for citizens to train with them such that they are fully prepared to serve militarily.

1," Guns don't kill people people kill people, I'm sorry but that's just a poor excuse pandered around by the gun  lobby. Sorry guys but guns kill people, a gun is a tool to kill, not protect your family, kill. Stop living in this sugar coated fantasy and wake up all gun ownership should be controlled, and even banned."
1, If guns weren't so freely available in the US then there wouldn't be so many people getting shot.  That is fairly obvious to us Brits.
1," YES.  But controlled doesn't have to mean there are no guns out there.  It could mean a) really good background checks, b) a waiting period, c) mandatory training in safety and even in target practice, and d) mandatory gun lock rules so kids and criminals are less likely to get there hands on it."
1," Just to the British citizens, aye?  /   /> No.  />   /> To the majority of the world."
2," I disagree with maugatar, for the simple fact that it is people WITH GUNS that kill people."
2," Ah, but you see, it is partially because of the Brits that we have the second amendment. The original framers of the constitution had developed a bit of distrust in government strong arm tactics due to certain disagreements with the British government and worked to limit government power in a number of ways. One of which was to insure our populations right to arm themselves.   /> Frankly I agree, and I think that history would support me on this. A government needs to be at least slightly afraid of what its people might do, or else they tend to collect more and more powers to themselves, and govern in such a way that has less and less to do with the wishes of the people."
2, The only thing I have to say about this is:  /   /> GUNS DONT KILL PEOPLE. PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE.  />   /> If there was a way to control people then you could stop gun violence all together but seeing as you cant do that you cant stop gun violence. Once you have a solution to how to control people Mr Flagg I would love to know. Thanks And don't come back with stricter laws because most gun violence is with an illegal gun. So people just need to educate themselves about proper gun use. This wouldn't make gun violence end but it would help to make the population more aware.
2, Stricter control or not the crazy people are gonna get guns regardless
2," The 2nd amendment which gives us the right to bear arms was for the safety of the people against invaders and if needs be, against the government.  It was initially meant so each state could have their own militia so the federal government didn't end up like the British government was when we fought a revolution against them.    />      In reply to MrFlagg, did you not read the statement?  He said most gun deaths are caused by illegal guns.  You say there need to be stricter gun laws but don't you know anything about human nature?  If something is outlawed people will get it from another source.  It happened with the Prohibition."
2," This is one of the few areas where I think America has got it right. In fact, I would say there are too many restrictions on gun ownership in America. Widespread gun ownership does not necessarily equal a large number of deaths through random acts of violence. The opposite could just as well be argued. Look at Switzerland. There is very little crime there. Yet virtually every Swiss male is in possession of an assault rifle. Every Swiss male is inducted into the military and upon induction is given an assault rifle and told to keep it in his home for use in case the country is ever invaded. This service as a soldier in the military reserve is essentially lifelong.   />   /> Watching the BBC, they endlessly harp on this gun ownership issue when covering the US every time there is a massacre.   />   /> America was, to a large extent, populated by criminals. Those criminal genes don't go away. That explains why there's lots of gun crime in the US, not the lax gun laws."
