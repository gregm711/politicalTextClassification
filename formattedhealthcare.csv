Urban Institute: ""The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

1,"Divisions on public vs. private healthcare favors hybrid. Jacob Hacker. ""The case for public plan"". The Institute for America's Future: ""Perhaps that is why Americans have long been strongly supportive of public-private hybrids in health care, believing that neither the government nor private insurance should be the sole source of coverage in a reformed system. In polls, a Medicare-like program covering all Americans beats the current system hands down. Yet Americans are even more receptive toward a mandate on employers to provide coverage.78 Historically, Americans have been deeply divided about their preferred approach to expanding health insurance. Although repeated surveys find a majority endorsing “national health insurance” for most of the second half of the twentieth century, when asked explicitly, Americans split evenly between those who favor administration of insurance benefits by government and those who prefer subsidies for private insurers.79 Thus, Americans seem to desire a combination of both private employment-based coverage and expanded public programs.""
"
2,"Following majority support for public option is tyranny of majority. Appeal to the majority is nothing more than tyranny of the majority and means absolutely nothing to whether a public insurance option is worth it or will even help. Just in case you don't believe this, ask yourself this... if 51% of the public thought slavery was good, would you use that as an argument for a change in equal rights' laws?
"
1," The government funds fire-stations, why not universal health care? The government taxes citizens to fund and provide numerous services universally, including policemen and firemen. These services are comparable to physician services in many ways, particularly in the sense that they help protect the life, safety, or health of citizens. Why shouldn't health care also be provided universally through the same means - taxes?
"
1,"Health is often out of an individual's control; like fires. You will see that the other side of this argument makes a distinction between things that an individual can control and those he/she cannot.  Their argument is that fire and police protection are things beyond the control of individuals.  But that healthcare is not.  This argument is seriously flawed.  Even a young child can see why. Many healthcare issues are very much out of the control of individuals.  What if you're in a bus accident?  Many accidents are out of the control of individuals. I agree that many accidents are a result of an individual being stupid or not being careful....but aren't many fires caused by this as well? There is no real distinction here.  Either you should be opposed to fire/police protection and universal healthcare, or should support both.  Picking one is a logical inconsistency
"
2,"Health problems are more about individual choices than fires and crime. While many people compare health care to police stations and fire stations, they are not the same services. Health care is largely about providing a service to the individual that compensates, often, for poor individual choices. Fire stations and police departments, on the other hand, provide services to a community and focus on protecting individuals against things they have no control over (crime and fires). The differences are very significant in regard to what the state is obligated to provide. The state is obligated to protect citizens from one-another. But, the state is not obligated to protect citizens from themselves. Universal health care is wrongheaded to the extent that it involves protecting individuals from themselves. 
"
2,"Whether universal health care is analogous to other services is inconsequential. Whether universal health care is analogous or a legitimate burden on tax payers does not answer whether a universal system provides the results proponents argue.
"
1," Health care is a basic human right or entitlement Health is fundamental to the preservation of all other individual rights. If one is sick in a hospital bed, they cannot be said to have equal opportunity or the ability to exercise free speech and religion. And, of course, one cannot pursue happiness if they are in a hospital bed. This is why health must be considered a basic human right.
"
1,"Universal health care protects healthy citizens from many health risks. If citizens have a right to be healthy, they are due some protections from the sickly. By providing for the sickly, government is helping protect the rights of the healthy.
"

"
1," Universal health care is a social good, not merely an economic good Universal health care generally decreases human misery and increases human welfare. It is, therefore, a social good, not merely an economic good. In general, the ability to afford something does not play a role in whether it is just or not. If there is a conflict between life and money life should prevail because it is a right while money is a want not a need. 
"
1," Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance. Yet, they then argue that a private insurance company cannot compete with a government program. This is contradictory. If private insurers believe their product is superior, they should not be worried about a public option.
"
1,"Universal health care is a legitimate ""burden"" on the tax payer. People pay for public utilities such as road and people pay for education as well. But do people who don't drive recklessly ask for money back when roads are damaged? Do people who send their children to private school ask for all their money back? We place this burden on the state because of equality of opportunity. No man should be denied the right to live his life.
"
1,"Universal healthcare helps foster greater equality across classes. In the United States, the poor commonly cannot afford health care. Universal health care helps them get the care that they need. Without health care, the poor are more vulnerable and have a harder time achieving their goals. This violates their right to equal opportunity. 
"
2," Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others. Universal health care holds some individuals accountable for the actions of others.    
"
2," Free, universal health care is an illegitimate ""positive"" right. The main premises here is that ""rights"" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable. The extreme of this argument is the circumstance in which a careless smoker is given the ""right"" to burden others for their expensive health care costs. 
"
2,"The necessity of medical care does not make it a right. Food, for example, is not considered a right, and companies are allowed to sell it, as well as to withhold it from those that need it but can't afford it. This is the right of grocery stores to do, and receives no complaint from society in general.
"
2," People leading healthy lives will be burdened by the unhealthy It is not fair for those that lead healthy lives to have to pay for those that lead unhealthy ones. Those that make decisions to smoke cigarettes and eat excessively should pay the consequences.

2," Government-funded universal health care would violate patient privacy - Sue Blevins. ""Universal Health Care Won't Work -- Witness Medicare"". Cato Institute. 2001. - ""Currently, many Americans choose to pay privately for health services to maintain their medical privacy. However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship. Just look at what has happened with Medicare.
"
1," Progress with public plan is more important than ""competition"" Insuring that over 40 million Americans have health insurance is much more important than the ideological notion of ""fair competition"". This is not to concede that a public plan is unfair, but rather to say that the whole debate over a ""level playing field"" misses the point that this is primarily an issue about insuring millions of uninsured individuals, by whatever means possible. These individuals need health insurance more than the health care industry needs a level playing field to continue its high profits.
"
2,"Whether health care is a right under i-law is inconsequential.  The mere act that a UN body on Human Rights has added that to their charter is not definitive of anything. Using it as an argument fails as it's only an appeal to authority.
"
2,"Whether universal health care is a legitimate ""burden"" on the tax payer should be considered inconsequential. Since health care is currently 1/7th of the US Economy, simply asking whether the tax payer can be burdened to help provide others with health care does nothing to ask whether allowing more government control will end with the results proponents predict.
"
2,"Whether universal health care is a social good is inconsequential. Again, this question's answer has no bearing on whether a universal system can provide the level of service proponents claim.
"
2,"It is impossible to answer whether universal health care fosters greater equality. Since the word equality necessitates a value judgment as to what is ""equal"" when it comes to health care and class status, a universal definition is not possible.  For instance - would it be equal if no one had access to MRI's? If only 80% of those requiring an MRI could get it - what would determine how to define those individuals ""equally""?
"
2,"Government-funded universal health care is not a ""right"" Anthony Randazzo. ""Questioning the ""Right"" to Health Care"". Reason Foundation. 2009. - ""People sometimes argue in favor of a universal human right to health care by saying that health care is different from all other human goods or products.

"
1," When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

1,"Many single-payer systems give patients free choice of practitioners. In some countries with socialized medicine, such as the UK, patients are offered a choice of general practitioner, all of whom are self-employed or work in private partnerships employing all practice nurses, doctors and clerical staff.

Balanced Politics.org - ""Government-controlled health care would lead to a decrease in patient flexibility.  At first glance, it would appear universal health care would increase flexibility. After all, if government paid for everything under one plan, you could in theory go to any doctor. However, some controls are going to have to be put in to keep costs from exploding. For example, would ""elective"" surgeries such as breast implants, wart removal, hair restoration, and lasik eye surgery be covered? [...] The compromises that result will put in controls that limit patient options. The universal system in Canada forces patients to wait over 6 months for a routine pap smear. Canada residents will often go to the U.S. or offer additional money to get their health care needs taken care of.""

1,"Free, universal health care helps the unhealthy in times of need. When an individual is sick, they shouldn't have to think about how to pay for their treatment. In free, universal health care systems, when one is sick, they are simply told to rest and get better. This is essential for proper healing. Conversely, in a non-free-universal-health-care system, a sick person is required to figure out how to pay for their health care, rather than simply focusing on getting better. The stresses this causes hampers healing.

1," Government will not favor public insurer over private insurers John Holahan and Linda Blumberg. ""Is the Public Plan Option a Necessary Part of Health Reform?"" Urban Institute: ""[one argument against the public option] is that the public plan will always be favored—that there is no way that Congress would let the public plan fail and would find ways to tilt the playing field in its favor, providing it with advantages not afforded private plans. However, experience with the Medicare program does not support this concern. Indications from the Medicare Advantage experience suggest that, if anything, private plans would most likely be favored over a public plan. For example, Medicare Advantage plans are paid percent more than Medicare fee-for-service in 2009 for the average beneficiary, clear evidence that traditional Medicare has not always been favored (MedPAC 2009).""
"
1," It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance. But, this is unfair and contrary to the higher moral principles upon which societies should be founded. Society should strive to defend and care for the needy and vulnerable, instead of subjecting them to a system that punishes them for their disadvantages.

1,"Unacceptable to leave health care of millions to rare charity orgs/docs. It is morally unacceptable to leave the health care of millions of American who cannot afford to pay insurance to the hands of the few rare doctors and charity health care services. Also, charity health services would not have enough equipment and funds to treat expensive, life-threatening diseases like cancers.

1," Public insurance would not kill the private insurance industry Probably the best evidence of this is found abroad in places such as France, where both public and private health insurance options exist in a hybrid system.

"
1," Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

2,"Universal health care leads to rationing. Medical resources are rationed in socialized systems so that some people are either denied care or have to wait for it.

The Institute for America's Future: ""public and private plans can learn from each other as they exploit their strengths and remedy their weaknesses. Expanded coverage of prescription drugs by Medicare HMOs, for example, demonstrated the feasibility of drug coverage for the elderly and helped to increase political pressure for drug coverage for all people with Medicare.

Similarly, innovations in coordinating care for elders with chronic illness in private plans have provided a useful foundation for care-coordination demonstrations in the public Medicare plan.""

2,"""Is it wrong to call single-payer systems socialized medicine?"" is another inconsequential question.  It's answer is meaningless to which system provides the most benefits to the most people.  It's a semantic argument which will hang more on specific definitions or words that anything resembling rational health care debate.  Having said that - the answer is ""yes"".

"
1," Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care. As such, there will be more paying patients in a universal health care system, which will result in more income for doctors. Doctors will also spend less time on paper work, be more efficient, service more patients, and so make more money. 
"
1," Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished. Doctors can chooses to operate private practices in a two-tier system. This will attract consumers who require either more personal service, those who know or want a personal doctor, and those who want better quality of care than the public system provides.
"
1,"Universal health care grounds doctors in professionalism, not commercialism. Doctors are currently businessmen that sell health services. But, realizing that this is not a good model for dealing people's lives and health, many doctors see universal health care as a way to better root their profession in professionalism instead of this commercialism. 
"
2," A right to health care violates the rights of physicians One cannot have a right to other people's services. Does a physician not have the free right of association and contract with patients? Why would physicians be forced to perform free or government-set prices for their labor? Why shouldn't they be able to charge market value for their services? Did they enter into their practices with the understanding that they would not be able to charge fair market value? No. They are generally service providers like any other that expect fair, market-based compensation. Universal health care would deprive physicians of this freedom to charge market-value by imposing government pricing on their services, almost certainly at a discounted rate. 
"
2,"Universal health care will cut physician cash-flow and disrupt living-standards. It is important to recognize that many private physicians have oriented their private practices around a certain level of cash-flow. They have rented office space at a certain level, taken out mortgages at a certain level, and sent their kids to private schools all on the assumption that their existing cash-flow in their private practices would continue into the future. It is unfair to suddenly and dramatically curtail this cash-flow and force physicians to re-adjust their lives accordingly. For some, this will be impossible or unbearable.
"
2," Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place. Talent would be lost from the industry and the quality of doctors and health care would fall.

And this is what terrifies the insurance companies and conservatives. Their fear is that it will actually work. If the program operates well, more and more people will make the rational decision to choose it over private insurance (what we're supposed to do in a market, after all) and the insurance companies will lose customers.""
"
2," Single-payer health care over-loads doctors and burns them out Because more people seek care, doctors in a universal health care environment often are over-loaded. Hoping to meet their patients needs, they work over-time. Yet, by doing this, they often burn out and leave their practice early, exacerbating the problem even further.
"
1," For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a ""loss"" for profit insurance companies. These companies are designed to maximize profits by cutting costs. How can these companies act in the best interests of their patients if their incentive structure is designed to minimize health coverage?
"
1," Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and ""high-risk"". These are the people that need health care the most, and the insurance industry has a direct interest in making it difficult or more expensive for them to obtain health insurance.
"
1,"Universal health care systems incentivize improving patient health. Many free universal health care systems provide incentives to doctors to improve the health of their patients. This contrasts with for-profit health care systems that do not provide financial incentives to doctors to improve the health of their patients, largely because healthier patients would mean lower profits. 
"
1," Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service. Such a system does not relate to the patients needs, but corresponds only to financial considerations.
"
1,"Universal health care allows investments in longer-term patient relationships. This happens because there is a long term relationship with the patient and the preservation of records has long term benefits. Investment in IT is one often cited example where health care providers in socialized systems have access to electronic records of patients tests online and where computer systems can check for example incompatible drug combinations and that drugs are administered to the right patient. Some for profit systems find this investment hard to justify because the provider-patient relationship is not guaranteed to last long enough to justify the investment. 
"
1,"Universal health care decreases the likelihood of health related problems. The single most destructive issue regarding health care in America is the lack of preventative care. Patients wait until their disease progresses to a dangerous level before they seek care because otherwise they can not afford medical cost. Universal health care offers them access, thus increasing the patient's incentive to seek care when the health threat is minimal, and in the long run reducing the burden to the state.

2," Government-mandated procedures would reduce doctor flexibility/quality ""Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?"" Balanced Politics.org - ""Government-mandated procedures will likely reduce doctor flexibility and lead to poor patient care.  When government controls things, politics always seep into the decision-making. Steps will have to be taken to keep costs under control.

Government influence will only make things worse, leading to decreased doctor flexibility and poor patient care.""

Such figures were ""terrifying enough"", the report by parliament's public accounts committee said, but the reality may be worse because of what it called ""substantial under-reporting"" of serious incidents and deaths in the NHS

2," Insurance industry has sufficient competition w/o public option Karl Rove. ""How to Stop Socialized Health Care"" Wall Street Journal. June 11, 2009: ""Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance. But 1,300 companies sell health insurance plans. That's competition enough. The results of robust private competition to provide the Medicare drug benefit underscore this. When it was approved, the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost $74 billion a year by 2008. Nearly 100 providers deliver the drug benefit, competing on better benefits, more choices, and lower prices. So the actual cost was $44 billion in 2008 -- nearly 41% less than predicted. No government plan was needed to guarantee competition's benefits.""

2,"Lack of preventative care does not significantly contribute to life expectancy or quality of life.  Most of what determines length and quality of life (excluding human issues such as traffic accidents, homicides...) is genetics and life style choices (eating/exercise).  Early detection will certainly weigh heavily on life expectancy for certain diseases, but no amount of ""prevention"" will stop cancer if you genes are highly susceptible.  As most people know, most doctor's visits end with ""take this and call me if it doesn't get better"" which should hardly be seen as ""preventative"" of anything.

1," Free universal health care motivates people to seek preventive care Preventing illnesses before they arise is a very important strategy in public health. Universal health care encourages people to seek preventive treatments because it is free. This cuts health care costs substantially down the line.

"
2,"Higher-end treatment is important; sometimes you can't prevent illness. With higher-end treatments in privatized health care societies, treatment is often superior.

1," Profit interests corrupt investments in medical innovation Drug and medical companies are driven, in large part, by the bottom-line of profits. Their investments in new drugs and medical innovations are driven by these interests. But, what is likely to make the most money is often at odds with public and patient interests. 
"
2," Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation. In general, the only way that people will take the time, energy, and risks involved with innovation is if there are substantial returns for their investment. This notion underpins the markets and capitalism generally, but is undermined by universal health care. Universal health care, therefore, could be expected to see fewer innovations and medical advancements.  
"
2,"Competition in private insurance can be improved without public plan. While it is true that the private insurance industry does have some anti-competitive monopolies, conglomerations, and State boundary issues, this does not mean that a more competitive environment cannot be created. This can and should be done, but it is unnecessary to inject into the equation a public insurer.
"
2,"Under investment in single-payer system leads to capacity shortages A lack of willingness to invest in expensive technology leads to shortages in areas such as MRI scanning. Some would argue that only the price mechanism in free market health care can allocate resources efficiently and that political pressure often leads to shortages in socialized systems.

1," Public health care is good; it just receives more scrutiny/criticism Public health care systems receive more scrutiny by the public because they are publicly accountable. This often gives the impression that these systems are worse. But, this impression is simply a bi-product of the higher level of scrutiny these systems receive. 
"
1," Single-payer health care reduces complexities faced by patients Insurance companies often make life as difficult as possible for patients through complicated rules and qualifications. Again, profit-interests motivate this because it makes it less likely that patients will seek a claim. This is all very stressful and time-consuming for patients. A single-payer system would simplify things.
"
2," Single-payer, universal health care results in long waits for patients Canada is a prime example of this. Many people find themselves waiting for long periods for care in Canada, and sometimes come to the United States to receive faster and higher quality care.

1," Competition in health care is generally a bad idea While competition can make sense when it relates to the production of goods, it is not good when it relates to dealing with human life. The main problem is that a primary means of ""cost-cutting"" is by skimping on services to people in need.
"

2," Public insurance is unfair competition for private insurers ""The End of Private Health Insurance"". Wall Street Journal (editorial). April 13, 2009: ""A public program won't compete in a way that any normal business would recognize. As an entitlement, Congress's creation will enjoy potentially unlimited access to the Treasury, without incurring the risks or hedging against losses that private carriers do.""
"
2," Single-payer health care erodes competition in price and value The notion of the free markets as a source of efficiency dates back to Adam Smith. The health care industry is no exception to this rule. If it is open to the free-markets, consumers will shop for and purchase the best price and value. Pressure will be placed on insurance companies to cut costs and sell their surface at a lower price for greater value. Free universal health care would interrupt this, reduce efficiency, and increase costs. 
"

1,"Universal health care makes people healthier so more productive.
"
1," Universal health care systems are more economically efficient America spends a far higher percentage of GDP on health care than any other country, and has worse ratings on a variety of subjects such as quality of care, efficiency of care, access to care, safe care, equity, right care and wait times according to the commonwealth fund. New Zealand, which spends one third per capita what the US spends on health care beats the US on every marker of efficiency and care. Although not definitive, this does lend credence to the idea that universal health care is more efficient than our for profit health care system as the US was inferior to Germany, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and to a lesser degree Canada in nearly all health care quality issues. This despite the fact that the US system costs 2-3x more per capita than the systems in these other countries.

"
1," Single-payer health care gets rid of wasteful middlemen According to an estimate by Dr. Marcia Angell roughly 50% of healthcare dollars are spent on healthcare, the rest go to various middlemen and intermediates to providing healthcare. A streamlined, non-profit, universal system would increase the efficiency with which money spent on healthcare goes to healthcare. 
"
1," Cost savings with universal health care will outweigh program costs It is important in this analysis to consider that, even if universal health care were to cost more now, that these costs could easily be outweighed by long-term cost-savings. In other words, the costs of not implementing universal health care would be greater than the costs of implementing it.
"
1,"Costs are inconsequential if health care is considered a universal right. It may very well be true that universal health care increases costs. Yet, if we presume that health care is a right, then such added costs are insignificant; they must be born to secure the right of universal health care.

June 11, 2009: ""government-run health insurance would crater the private insurance market, forcing most Americans onto the government plan. The Lewin Group estimates 70% of people with private insurance -- 120 million Americans -- will quickly lose what they now get from private companies and be forced onto the government-run rolls as businesses decide it is more cost-effective for them to drop coverage. They'd be happy to shift some of the expense -- and all of the administration headaches -- to Washington. And once the private insurance market has been dismantled it will be gone.""

1," Universal health care reduces administrative costs (i.e. paper work) Medical professionals are often challenged with massive amounts of paperwork in private health care systems. A universal health care system will help coordinate and reduce paperwork, allowing doctors to concentrate on treating patients. A single payer system could save $286 billion a year in overhead and paperwork. Administrative costs in the US health care system are estimated to be substantially higher than in other countries and than in the public sector in the US: one estimate put the total administrative costs at 24 percent of US health care spending.
"
1," A profit health care environment results in more frivolous lawsuits When profits are driving doctors to gave favor to patients with good, private insurance, an environment is created that is prone to lawsuits. Indeed, in the United States, this is one of the reasons why malpractice lawsuits are so common.

[...] A dominant government insurer [...] could potentially keep costs down by squeezing the suppliers of health care. This cost control works not by fostering honest competition but by thwarting it. [...] If the government has a dominant role in buying the services of doctors and other health care providers, it can force prices down. Once the government is virtually the only game in town, health care providers will have little choice but to take whatever they can get. It is no wonder that the American Medical Association opposes the public option.""

Australia tightly controls its immigration and thus there are fewer non-contributors (back into the system used by all) because there aren't as many as 30 million people who are either here illegally or related to an illegal worker and draining the system intended to assist legal residents and citizens.
2,"The flawed premise behind ""universal health care"" is regarding health care as a ""right"". Health care is a need, but not a ""right"", and that's a critical difference. A right is a freedom of action, such as the right to free speech or right to contract. It is not an unearned automatic claim on the goods or services produced by another person -- that's just state-sanctioned theft or slavery. Just because my neighbor is hungry, it doesn't give him the right to take a can of soup from my pantry.Rights only impose negative obligations on others -- for instance, my right to free speech only means that someone else (my neighbor or the government) can't stop me. If someone chooses to leave me alone, then he hasn't violated my rights.Any alleged ""right"" to health care can only be implemented by violating the actual rights of doctors and other health care providers. This is why ""universal health care"" is such a grossly immoral policy, and should be opposed as such."

Under this reasoning, a person who comes into the ER is violating a Dr's rights because they owe them a care of duty at this point.

Law enforcement, military, and prisons are constitutional, health care is not. For decades free market health care delivery worked just fine. When I was a lad of 7 (42 years ago), my mother and father took me to a local doctor, where they paid $5 for the visit, and at the time of the visit. There was no billing, either to my parents or to a third party. He had a nurse who worked for him, who also doubled as a receptionist.Today's doctor's office is filled with extra billing people, filing people, etc., just to fulfill the insurance requirements for billing for services. 42 years ago, $5 equates to about $20-30, which is about the cost of co-pay. Yet, insurance companies pay hundreds more for that office visit. Therein lies the problem.It's quite simple, really. Government has mandated too damn much. It has run up the cost of the health insurance. What do I need maternity coverage for? My wife is 50 years old, and I am 49. We aren't going to have a baby any time soon. I also don't have any mental health issues, or substance abuse issues. Neither does my wife. Why do we need Mental Health parity?The free market would allow consumers (that's us, John) to select the coverage they desire or need, if any. We could bargain with companies to get the best coverage for the best price. Consumer Reports could tell us which insurance companies would do that. Then we, the consumer, could decide which company to buy from, and what coverage we need (cafeteria style ring a bell?), if any. That's the beauty of the free market, it gives us freedom to choose what's best for ourselves and our family. Government cannot do that. They do not have the omnipresence, or omniscience to do so. Mr. Obama has never met me, and has no idea what my family needs. Neither do you John. So, I thank you to mind your own business, keep your hand out of my loved one's pockets, and pay for your own damn insurance.He continued:""Just stop thinking about money for a minute and think about what we are doing! Deregulation and opening up every problem to be solved by people seeking profit is not the answer to our most important problems. I would rather take my cancer or other life threatening health issue to a SHAMAN than to someone whose primary interest is personal profit or the survival of a corporation.We can control a Democratic Republic somewhat through the democratic process. We cannot control a corporation without regulation and then we cannot force it to provide for our needs. And we once had a right to health care via the Public Health Service however bad it was. Now we are told that it is a privilege of those with money."" I'm sorry John, but I digitally signed the agreement to be nice on this site. Otherwise I would answer this balderdash with words not appropriate for polite company. Since I am a man of my word, I'll leave your comments to speak for themselves. Anyone who has ever stood in line at the mercy of a bureaucrat, and compared the service to that provided at the local retail store knows where the better service, with superior product lies. I'll give you a hint: it ain't the bureaucrat that gives me the service...'nuff said."
2," Public option weakens private insurers, forcing many out of their plans ""The End of Private Health Insurance"". Wall Street Journal (editorial). April 13, 2009: ""In a recent analysis, Lewin estimates that enrollment in the public option will reach 131 million people if it is open to everyone and pays Medicare rates. Fully 119 million people will shift out of -- or lose -- private coverage. Everything depends on the payment levels that Congress adopts, as well as the size of the eligible pool. But even if a public option available to all takes the highly improbable step of paying at some midpoint between private and Medicare rates, nearly 68 million people will still be crowded out of private insurance.""

2,How about an example of this so-called 'social solidarity'? Are you so sure it exists?
2,"And this Social Solidarity is chosen for us by the Congress and President, who will tell us, who can recieve what care, when and how.After which, will come the choice of physicians (mostly GPs. who will be told what kind of care can be given, by those   doctors   who are still practicing   medicine  . There is a shortage of medical personnel now and when you begin to tell a doctor how he can treat a patient, if he can treat a patient, and how long it will take to fit the patient in, by the government, doctors who take the HIpocratic oath seriously, will just give up and find a different line of work.  It isn't as though they aren't sufficiently educated to do any other work they might try."

Is the option to allow a combination of both systems to prosper taxing all, rebating non-access system users taxed a ""%"" back at the end of 5 years?"
1,"We already give healthcare to anyone that needs it if they show up to the emergency room. I think we'd get a lot more bang for our buck if we simply treated people before they end up in the emergency room.Regarding rights, why wouldn't your analogy also apply to public education? I believe that investing in certain aspects of our society (education and healthcare are in that group) pay dividends to us all! "
2,Not everyone treated at the emergency room has an actual emergency.  That's part of the problem.It does not follow that just because something benefits society that it must be coercively mandated by the government.  If that argument holds water for you then I'd suggest reading up the utilitarian arguments for capitalism and the free market.
1,"I just had the ""aha"" moment while reading your response.  Yes, we should turn away all non-emergencies from the emergency rooms.  Let the uninsured die.  Then only the insured will populate the country, eliminating the whole   health care   problem thing.  Freakin' brilliant.  Compassion is a religious value and therefor a violation of that Church and State thingee.  Let Darwin be Darwin and soon we'll only have the lower middle class to worry about.  Hell, they don't even vote, so they won't be much of a problem.  And that comment about something that benefits   society   not necessarily being mandated, and the argument for it not holding water.  Oh, hell yeah.  Dams hold water to prevent flooding and provide drinking water, but why the hell should we pay for them?  If the free market can't provide economical and safe water to the people, then let them drink beer.  And traffic lights.  What's up with that?  The military - if we all had   guns   and were willing to use them, and willing to buy tickets to Iraq and Afghanistan we wouldn't waste all that   money   on stealth bombers and stuff.  I've been reading up on the free market and it seems it is the answer to everything.  Actually black markets are the best because they are the purest form of free enterprise.  So it follows that the pot and meth dealers are the paragons of free market economics.  Adam Smith rocks."
2,"Not only do you fail to make any arguments at all but you appeal purely to emotion.  Since when is making a big decision that affects everyone better to do by instinct/feelings?Let's review.""Let the uninsured die""  You are saying this with sarcasm so you think the uninsured shouldn't die? Newsflash: everybody dies.  Also, people who die because they can't afford   health insurance   actually die from natural causes because if it was an accident, they go to the emergency room where they receive care no matter what.""Then only the insured will populate the country""  Again, everybody dies. And this is just a ridiculous statement to appeal to emotion.The only other point I think needs a response is your tactless criticism of capitalism.  However, contrary to the point I think you were trying to make, you are correct. Drugs are available to almost everyone and the prices are low because it truly is a free market.  Isn't it silly that we allow these things to be available and cheap while we regulate everything else?  Like the fact that the new (potential) sugar tax would increase prices for the cheapest foods thus making it even more difficult for the lower class to afford   food  ?  I agree the free market is not the answer to everything but with a little regulation (far less than we currently have today), the free market does make products and services available to everyone and keep prices down better than price caps (those have side affects)."

2,"Employers may dump their employees into public insurance. Stuart Butler. ""The Case Against: The public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage"". Heritage Foundation. July 28, 2009: ""[With public insurance] there would actually be big changes for many already insured people. Faced with a low-cost public option, many employers would simply close down their existing plan and push their employees into the public plan. Remember that Wal-Mart encouraged eligible employees to sign up for Medicaid, until states and unions thwarted them. All serious analysts agree that many Americans would find themselves dumped into the public plan."" Because a public plan would have limited insurance, the public plan may not be able to cover all these people dumped by their employers. In the end, therefore, a public plan may leave more people without insurance, employer-provided or otherwise. Or, it may just entirely negate itself by simply transferring insured individuals from private plans to a public one, leaving little room for the remaining uninsured.

There are serious flaws with both systems. In fact, it seems we would have to choose between a system that rations medical care on a waiting list (Canadian and British systems) or rations it by price (user pays systems).Australia has a national health scheme as well as fee for service medicine and a tax system that strongly encourages private health insurance. This is far from perfect, either, but Australia does have a higher life expectancy than the USA, Great Britain and Canada. Of course, there is no proof that this is wholly due to the health care arrangements, but with a life expectancy of over 2.5 years greater than the USA it must be doing some things better."

They'll call it 'socialized medicine' -- but by now we should all have realized that Republicans will call any health care reform Democrats propose 'socialized medicine' (that's what they said about Clinton's 1993 health plan, whose chief cost containment measure was enhancing the role of HMOs). They'll scream about 'government bureaucrats getting between you and your doctor.' But anyone who has tried to get reimbursement for a medical service from an insurance company that didn't want to provide it knows that government bureaucrats are pussycats compared to insurance company bureaucrats.""

2,"Do you know why they have a higher life expectancy? Because through our superior medical care, we have more live births. Unfortunately, some of those marginally healthy babies die, bringing down the overall life expectancy. "
1,"According to the CIA, Australia has an infant death rate of 4.75 per thousand, in the United Kingdom it's 4.85, in Canada it's 5.04 and in the United States it's 6.26.  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html  Let's put that into figures that are easier to understand. In 2007, there were 4,217.000 births in the United States. At a death rate of 6.26 per thousand, that would mean that 26,398 of those babies would die. At a death rate of 4.75 per thousand, only 20,031 babies would have died. In other words, if America had the infant death rate that Australia has, more than 6,000 US babies would live. So whatever the reasons there are for the lower life expectancy in the United States, superior medical care of infants does not appear to be one of them."

There is a ""point"" (and I admit I'm not sure what that is, and I don't have time to check now) after which when a baby dies it is deemed a mortality, before that point, it is not, it is (for actuarial purposes) not even in the pool. We have the superior medical expertise to get more marginal babies to that point, so they count against us, whereas the less developed countries can't get their babies to that ""point"". Let's suppose for the sake of the discussion, that ""point"" is 24 hours. In other countries who do not have our medical capabilities or expertise, a ""sick"" baby dies in the first 6 hours. That does not count against their mortality table. In the US, that baby might be kept alive for a week or two, only to experience complications and then die. That impacts our mortality."
1,"Blackbird, I note your reply. I am disappointed that you replied with rancour rather than politeness and rhetoric rather than evidence. I therefore challenge you to provide some evidence. Where is the evidence that medical care in the United States is superior to medical care in other countries? Where is the evidence that infant deaths are worked out differently in the United States?I have shown that the infant death rate in the United States (6.26) is greater than the infant death rate in Australia (4.75). Life expectancy is also greater in Australia (81.63 years) than the United States (78.11 years).The CIA says: ""Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages.""   https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html  The problem is not with sick babies. The United States has a higher death rate than other countries overall. That's the way it is. "
2,"Do you really doubt that medical care is NOT superior in the US than in other countries? Which country has the highest penetration of technical developments (MRIs etc)? Which country is responsible for developing virtually all new drugs?Personally, I feel life expectancy is driven more by   society   than by   medicine  . Australia has no where near the level of   crime   that we do.If you're ok with a single payor, government run   healthcare   system, go for it. But please show me just one thing the government does better than the private sector."
1,"Blackbird, the US certainly is a trailblazer in medical research. However, medical care is another thing. I agree that societal   conditions   do contribute to longevity but I believe that medical care also has an impact. As for what governments do well, or at least less badly, that would depend on your point of view. Our post offices used to be part of a great bureaucracy; now the local post office appears to be run as franchised businesses. On the other hand, public schools were introduced because the private schools simply could not and would not provide a universal service. But that is off topic. Whatever the causes for the higher death rates in the United States it would at least suggest that Americans should be looking at other countries to find out how they could improve their game."
1,"The nations with the best numbers (look it up at the World Health organization) all have universal healthcare. The flaws of UH can't be that bad if maternal mortality rates, for example, are 1 in 4800 in Ireland and 1 in 48,000. As for a moral obligation - we have already, as a society, decided it is best for eeryone if we pay for every child's education. Isn't more important to make sure they get to live? Wouldn't preventative medicine save the nation in lost work days and school days? And for that matter, is money really the most important consideration? Here kid, learn some math, but good luck taking care of that asthma problem you have. If you make it to 18, we might have some jobs for you, thanks to your high school diploma.Cuba has better infant and maternal mortality rates than us, for Pete's sake. ""Entitlements"" aren't just lazy people trying to rip you off. Since you are already against increasing the minimum wage and all for eliminating benefits and moving jobs across seas, you've pretty much gone out of your way to maintain an American caste system where the unfortunate have to stay that way. Be careful what you wish for, or you may kill us all off and have no one to run your cash registers and maintain your road medians."
2,"There are some facts about those infant mortality statistics that perhaps you should consider...namely, the criteria used to compile them. For example, Dr. Linda Halderman shed some important light on this.   http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/the-doctor-is-in-infant-mortality-comparisons-a-statistical-miscarriage  /In this article, Dr. Halderman documents the myriad differences from country to country in the methodology.Adjusted for these differences, infant mortality rates in the U.S. are no worse than other countries, despite the large number of illegal immigrants living here, as well as a less healthy lifestyle. Of course, mere statistics never justify the violation of anyone’s rights. As for the level of neo-natal care in America, I can attest to its high quality. My granddaughter was born at 25 weeks and 1.4 pounds, and is now a healthy, thriving 5 year old.Cuba? Cuba is a dictatorship. That means the flow of all information is strictly controlled by the government, and there is no free, investigative press or freedom-of-information laws. But just the fact that you use a dictatorship to support your call for socialized medicine is quite telling.When did ""we...as a society"" decide on government-run schooling? It evolved from a flaw at our founding…the failure of the Founders to protect freedom of education from political intrusion, in the way that religious freedom was protected behind the “wall of separation” between church and state. I fully and passionately believe that a proper education for every child is one of a parent’s most solemn responsibilities. But I oppose government-run schools, for the same reason as I oppose government-run healthcare. It is immoral, impractical, and a violation of individual rights. But I guess, as an independent thinking human being, I don’t qualify as a part of this “society” that you claim makes these decisions. What’s interesting here is that you would actually use the example of public education to justify socialized medicine. Public education is beset by exploding costs, and deteriorating quality...just what one would expect from a coercive political monopoly. American medicine is heading down the same path, due to massive government interference and controls. A complete healthcare dictatorship, rather than a return to freedom in medicine, is the wrong solution for anyone who values quality, readily available health care. An ""American caste system"" is exactly what would result from putting the state in charge of all economic decision-making…which is apparently what you want to do. In a free market...which we now have only in bits and pieces…everyone is free to act on his own judgement, and to advance as far as his ability and ambition will carry him. If one wishes to increase his pay, he is free to increase his skills, work longer hours, seek another job, or create his own job by starting a business. What he is not allowed to do, in a free, rights-respecting society, is force job-creating businesses to pay him more than they are willing to pay through government-imposed minimum wage laws. If you don't like the fact that a particular company hires people you don’t approve of (moving jobs across seas), you are free to protest by refusing to buy their products. If you don’t like a company's ""benefit"" policy, then again, you are free to move on. You see, when you are free, you control your life...which means you are not at anyone’s mercy. That is what the ""free"" in free market means. When government regiments the economic life of a nation…when we are at the mercy of government officials...then actual individuals are locked into a cast, having become dependant on government favor. But I agree with you that "" 'Entitlements' aren't just lazy people trying to rip you off."" They are also big businesses seeking government subsidies, bailouts, and other favors. They are middle and upper middle class earners seeking ""affordable"" this or that, and then demanding that government force someone else to provide it. They are workers seeking ""living wages"" that they are not qualified for or that no one is willing to voluntarily pay them. They are residents of wealthy towns seeking to keep out lower-income ""undesirables"" in order to preserve the ""quality"" of ""their"" communities through restrictive zoning and planning practices. And, yes, they are also ""just lazy people trying to rip you off."" They come in all shades, classes, and regions. And the entitlement mentality engulfing this country is made possible by one single common denominator…the government’s power to hand out economic favors to some at the expense of others. A universal healthcare entitlement is a lose-lose proposition. You hand over your money to a central planning bureaucracy, and in return you give up the right to make your own health care decisions. "
2,A smart person! OMFG!!!If only Michael Glass would learn from you. 
1,"Let's see if I fully understand the arguments against universal healthcare.1) Healthcare is not a ""right"".  Seems like the whole ""Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness"" would cover that.  If we've got a right to life then we have to have a right to care for that life and keep it going.   It's also hard to Pursue Happiness if you're sick due to a lack of medical treatment.2) Other countries aren't doing it well so we shouldn't do it at all.If we use this as a criteria we should disband the military too.  Many other countries have a bad military.  Clearly that means we shouldn't have one.  Lots of countries have bad water treatment too so let's stop doing that.  Are you really telling me that you don't think that we can learn from other countries mistakes and improve on their system.  Are you trying to tell me you don't think we can do something better than the Canadians and the French?  3) It's ""Socialized Medicine"".We've got socialized medicine now.  Anyone who's sick can go to the emergency room and the hospital has to treat them whether they can pay or not.  In the end we all pay for it either through government payments to the hospital, insurance or higher medical costs.  If everyone had healthcare they could get it treated early when it's more cost effective.  Why are we only paying for the poor's healthcare when it's the most expensive?  "
1," Choosing between complicated health insurance plans is difficult John Holahan and Linda Blumberg. ""Is the Public Plan Option a Necessary Part of Health Reform?"" Urban Institute: ""there is considerable variation in health insurance products sold, and consumers have great difficulty in making price and quality comparisons. This is especially true in the private nongroup insurance market, but is increasingly true in commercial group insurance as well. [...] The products offered by sellers in insurance and hospital markets are complex and difficult to understand and evaluate. It is almost impossible to compare prices of either insurance products or services provided by hospitals and other health providers."" [The status quo, therefore, offers little ""reasoned choice"". Simple public insurance would make it easier on consumers.]
"
1," Insurers should not be trusted with sole control of health insurance Jacob Hacker. ""The case for public plan"". The Institute for America's Future: ""As health policy expert Jeanne Lambrew puts the point, the question is not why nonelderly Americans without secure workplace coverage should have the same choice that seniors do: enrolling in a public or private plan. The question is: 'Why should policymakers give private insurers the exclusive right to cover Americans? If private insurers can better meet our goals for the health system, why object to a level competition with public plans?'""
"
2,"I don't think you are understanding the argument, let me see if I can lend some clarity.1) Health care is not a ""right.""Rights are freedoms of action in a social context.  They are not an obligation on others to provide goods or services.  Yes, your right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness does mean that you have the right to seek medical services. It does not mean you have to violate the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of others by demanding they provide it.We have the freedom of speech but this does not put an obligation on others to reply what you said on TV and make others watch.  We have the freedom of the press but this does not mean the government should create newspapers for each of us, or that I can force the New York Times to print my views.  We have the freedom of religion but this does not mean the government ought to build churches at someone else's cost or force everyone into a single monolithic religion.  Like wise, your freedom to contract with others to attain goods and services does not mean that others are obligated to provide those goods and services.2) Other countries aren't doing it well so we shouldn't do it at all.You're right in your assertion that just because someone else fails at something does not mean we will as well.  However, all countries that provide or have provided universal health care have struggled or collapsed.  This doesn't mean we should give up health care but it does mean we shouldn't try to emulate faltering systems.  Could we improve? Possibly.  Will we improve? Maybe, no one's done it yet though.  Does this mean we should coercively enlist all people into a single system that we can't guarantee is better when all evidence shows it creates more problems?  No.3) It's ""Socialized Medicine"".We aren't paying only when its an emergency.  Why would we expect more of the same to work when it hasn't anywhere else?  Why should we avoid a system, the free market, when it has worked  in every where else?  Don't confuse a free market system with a charity free system and don't confuse a socialist system with a free charity system.  What we need is a voluntary solution that emphasizes the patient, not a coerced monopoly that dehumanizes us all."
1,"I am Fred my main fight is to end the War on US (drugs) and stop putting good people in jail for thinking they have freedom of choice. It is a little off subject for me but it is part of my plan. If you are aware and read you know our so-called leaders senate/house lie to us and waste our money and vote with the corporations that pay them through PACs (political action committees) having said that here is my plan. To believe in my plan you should first watch the documentary SICKO by Roger Moore. You will see how the Canadians love their system they can go to any doctor and pay nothing it is high quality universal health care. DO NOT believe the lies our leaders will tell you. Big money is paying our leaders house/senate through PACs to not have universal health care and it is the same reason as in the War on Drugs. Greed is the main motivator for both actions so do not listen to the lies see the movie and listen to the real people that have nothing to gain by lying about the system. They love it! My plan is to end the War on US (drugs) and save the money (estimated to be 100 billion a year) and the estimated 50 billion lost in tax income from sales of just Marijuana and pay for universal health care for all Americans. The estimated cost of universal health care is 70 billion so we would have 80 billion left over. So if you take the wrong legal drug you can go to the doctor and get help not thrown in jail to be raped and have you future life destroyed by our greedy out of control so called leader house/senate. We will not conform to a War conceived of racism perpetuated by greed and supported by lies. The War on US (drugs) must end and get free health care for all at no extra cost. LEGALIZE*REGULATE*TAX  quit putting our children, mothers, fathers, yes even grandparents in jail for exercising a constitutional right that was stolen 70 years ago!"
1,"Sure, provide government healthcare to all. Its seems that people complain that their ""illness"" prevents them from working. So, provide healthcare for all get them well and get rid of welfare to help balance the cost of healthcare. "
1,"The question posed can serve as a Rorshach test.  I could just as easily debate one side as the other.  So I have difficulty deciding if my response is pro or con.  Given the non-specificity of the question, I will alter the frame to one I can endorse.I would like to have some level of health coverage for all US citizens.  De facto, we have emergency coverage and hospitalization coverage.  We cannot turn patients away from the emergency department.  If the patient has medical need for hospitalization, we must provide care.  We cannot ""dump"" the patient to another hospital.But that is not the question we should answer.  Would we as a country benefit from a form of universal health coverage?  I would point out that the question does not imply a single payer system.  Rather should we develop a minimal health coverage that all should have.  Should we adopt a version of the Massachusetts plan?We could argue this question as a moral issue.  Some would argue that health care is a right.  Calling health care a right raises another interesting debate.  That debate involves semantics and definitions.  I would prefer to avoid the moral debate, and view this question more pragmatically.We have much data on the value of primary care.  I refer to this definition: ""A set of attributes, as in the 1978 IOM definition—care that is accessible, comprehensive, coordinated, continuous, and accountable—or as defined by Starfield (1992)—care that is characterized by first contact, accessibility, longitudinality, and comprehensiveness.""  Our current payment scheme does not encourage physicians to enter the field. So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?  I will argue that we can only afford universal health coverage if we adopt some capitalistic principles.  Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.  We could prorate their share of any diagnostic testing, hospitalization or drugs. Having patients involved financially in decision making  should help physicians with several discussions.  First, patients often want an expensive diagnostic test.  If I believe that the test is not truly indicated, then I try to convince the patient not to have the test.  Involving money in the discussion only works if the patient is actually paying a portion of the costs.  Second, this strategy would encourage patients to use appropriate generic drugs.  When patients have responsibility for drug costs, they become very interested in $4/month prescriptions.  Without this incentive, they will often want a drug that they have seen advertised on television or in magazines.So with many caveats I favor universal health coverage.  I believe that the investment would ultimately save societal resources."
2,"What happens when a large company gives you healthcare?  It then becomes in their best interest to ""take care of you"" and they begin to say, you must take a 10 minute break every two hours, and you must arm stretches, or rest your eyes from looking at your computer monitor, or whatever it may be.  And even now, it is more expensive to get health insurance for people who smoke, or who are overweight, then people who don't or aren't.My point being...What happens when the government takes over healthcare.  What kind of rules/laws will be placed on every citizen because everyone is paying for everyone else.  Why should I pay for Joe Smith who is 200 pounds overweight, smokes, and doesn't take care of himself when I jog every morning, don't smoke and am in good health?I could go on, but I think you get the idea..."
2,"You are right, Austraila, Canada, and the UK all have universal healthcare. The major problem with the system that is used in those countries is that it raises their taxes and also access to healthcare is extremely slow. I ma probably one of the lucky ones, I healthcare from where I work. One week when I was sick, I called my DR's office and had an appointment that week. Where with the system that is used in Canada(personaly know friends in Calgary) this would probably take a few months before I am seen. I work in the Emergency Room of a Veterans Hospital, this is a prime example of how Universal Healthcare would work int the US. Our veterans wait for at least 3 months to see their pirmary care provider, consiquently, the Emergency Room is over run with patients that would normaly be taken care of by their primary care provider. This is all not even considering how well the federal government runs thing. For example look at the wonderful job they do with FEMA. Personaly I think we would be better off if we presure the Health Insurance Campanies e.g. Blue Cross, Aetna, etc, to a ensure everyone has access to health care. Also presure on the pharmacutical companies to level their prices for perscription medications.I think that if they were actualy spending all the money that they are saying they are on research, we should have cures for cancer and the comon cold by now."
2,"SkipTN,You have the right idea that UHC would increase wait time and pressure on emergency rooms, etc.The solution to this problem is not to pressure insurance companies to cover everyone.  They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.  It's true that not everyone would have coverage. Health coverage would cost more for unhealthier people. Wouldn't this encourage people to take care of themselves? I would rather encourage people to do what's right for them than to force it with   taxes   on unhealthy   food  ,   cigarettes  , etc. while still paying for their continued (more expensive) unhealthy habits.  I also strongly disagree with the idea of a few people making a decision that will affect everybody.  If everyone was unanimous in this decision, it would have much higher chance of success.  The simple fact that people are divided means live and let live.  That is the basis of this country isn't it?"
2,Healthcare should not be universal becasue like many things in the world it needs to be earned. If you have more money you can get better insurance so someone that earns alot of money should be able to pay for better heatlh care then some bum off the streets.
1,"That ""bum"" you refer to represents the 47 million americans who can not afford our exorbitant current   healthcare   rates. Around 22,000 people in the U.S. die a year because they can't afford healthcare. Imagine a ""bum"" who has a family and chooses to feed them instead of visiting the doctor because he can't afford both. Should the   children   of the ""bum"" have to suffer and possibly die because the ""bum"" can't afford healthcare? With a single-payer system or at least a public option this scenario would not exist. The child's medical condition could have been prevented if he had visited the doctor precisely when he started having symptoms.Healthcare should not be something you have to earn, it is a right. Do you have to earn protection from the   police   or the fire department? No, they are guaranteed to be there to protect you. Should you have to earn being cared for when you randomly develop   cancer  ?No Should you have to earn being able to take your children to the doctor?NoYou can compare healthcare to a police force. Cancer can be compared to a person who is attacking you. If a police officer is near you while you are being attacked, he will obviously intervene because it is his duty. If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT. The United States of America accept this declaration, and if you do not, you are disagreeing with one of the most basic declarations of human rights.P.S. With a public option, the rich population of America could still get their pampered, expensive   health care   while the rest of the population who is not so fortunate could receive a free option."
2,"22,000 people die a year?  Really?  Is the goal for this figure supposed to be 0?If he can't afford it then too bad. (I don't have   health care   because I can't afford it. You cannot use that ""but you're rich"" argument.)Forcing someone else to pay someone else to take care of you is not a right. I suppose I disagree ""with one of the most basic declarations of human rights.""  Does that mean you are going to steal my   money   through   taxes  ? In case you were unaware, the definition of to steal is ""To take (the property of another) without right or permission.""  (  http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/steal  )I do not give permission nor do you have a right to my property as is stated in the Constitution.  And yet, if I have a gun to defend my right to property from the government that is supposed to protect it, I will be arrested.  They will steal my freedom as well as my rights.""PS With a public option, the rich population of America could still get their pampered, expensive health care while the rest of the population who is not so fortunate could receive a free option."" Nothing costs nothing. The rich population of America will be paying for the rest of the population. If I were rich, I would move out of the country. Perhaps the US will copy California....As for your comments comparing the   police   with   health   coverage, there is a difference between protection from others and protection from death by natural causes. These cannot be compared."

2,"This is not a taboo word. It is what it is and the scary thing is - it is arriving in America. Universal healthcare is socialist in nature. Rather than go into it, I will say one thing. Look to examples in other countries, read your history books. Socialism does not work. Healthcare in Europe does not work. Sure, everyone has it but the quality is poor and they cannot get prompt care when they are really sick. You want to dole out 'free' healthcare to all? Then quality care for the major illnesses is what you will compromise. You can't have it all. Besides, where will all the Canadians go to for quality healthcare if it goes national here?"
2,"Use the correct words for what people are asking for and maybe the argument will simmer down.  ""Universal Healthcare"" is simply a politically correct term for letting the ruling political party decide who dies during the current fiscal year.  When the cost of cancer drugs is more than the economic return on the people who need them, the government will stop paying for the drugs and let the people die. Don't get too sick to pay taxes or you will be dead within 1 election cycle.   Look at England and the other countries that share our ""values"" and have made healthcare a universal right.  The government decides who lives and who dies.  Today, the British and the Canadians with enough money, can go to America or India and get what they need by paying for it with what little money they have left after taxes.  Most can't because the tax burden is very high to pay for this ""free"" care."
2,"I believe that the efforts to make Health Care accessible, affordable and flexible will endanger our ability to deliver innovative, quality care to a vast majority of Americans that are currently covered and content with the quality of the care they receive.   Catastrophic care and access to care are certainly issues that should be discussed and acted upon, but not at the cost of the covered.  Why penalize Americans with a bureaucratic monolithic Health Care service?   Many lessons learned can be obtained if we take a deeper look at the   evolution   of the NHS in the UK.  Here are a variety of issues that have impacted socialized / universal care in Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, France & the UK.? Universal Health Care will mean an increase in   taxes  ? Will cap the salaries of clinical professionals? Will decrease the amount of specialist (access & credentialed)? Will limit innovation in   health   information   technology  ? Will limit innovation in medical devices? Will lower personalized services (one size fits all)? Will lower expectations for services, delivery & quality of care? Will increase wait time for procedures? Will increase wait time for surgeries? Will deny services (surgeries / treatments) for senior citizens? Will increase supplemental insurance premiums for privatized care? Will require additional travel to acquire medical services, especially specialty services? Will attenuate innovative procedures & roll out of new technologies? Will harm ability to deliver emergency care (ambulance limitations)? Will harm patient and consumer choice in services, physicians and treatment plans? Will increase layers of bureaucracy? Will lower requirements & require incentives for capped medical professionals? Will increase malpractice suits? Will harm patient safety? Will continue to provide medical services to un-authorized illegal’s? Will increase foreign borne physicians ? Will lower clinical services, benefits & rights offered to over 80% of current insured Americans? Will lower the standards of care? Will require new Government protocols, regulation and mandates set up by bureaucrats, lacking medical credentials? Will lower patient options? Will close medical facilities and specialty services and clinics across the country (consolidation off services, for cost control)? Will limit   medication   competition? Will eliminate competition? Will harm Health Care supporting & contributing industries? Will decrease number of ""nationals"" physicians (medical school recruitment challenges)This is data that I have accrued over the past 24 years in Health Care information technology.  I have been providing national and international market research for more than 24 countries around the world (primarily OECD countries); representing Health Care IT and medical device firms wanting to break in to new vertical regions.  These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.	The fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.	The number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.	Cost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart disease…)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.	Chronic Disease 2.	Catastrophic Care3.	End of Life Care4.	Pediatric Care5.	End of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.	The invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.	Health Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.

2,"The costs of medical treatment should be enough to scare everyone able to do so into getting   health insurance  . And for those who have a hard time getting insurance into taking better care of themselves with regular checkups. In many cases I'm in agreement with some other comments that we are responsible for our own well being or if we're underage then our parents are.But I think if we could get costs under control we'd be in a better position to consider the economic burden the individual would have to carry vs. what the government would have to tax us for. My professor's husband had to have surgery on his large or small intestine, I can't remember which, the thing that stuck with me about the story is that there was a $3,500 charge for a sterilized tray. Granted it was the sterilized tray the surgery took place on but how much of that cost is profit? At present I'm not in favor of what a tax for universal   health care   would do to my income or the lack of responsibility for self that it would promote. (Not everyone would be irresponsible about their   health   mind you. Most people are smarter than that.) "
2,"Socialism is never the solution.  Stealing   money   from some people (while calling it ""taxation"") to pay for the medical expenses of others in still wrong.

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies. People would be more likely to see a doctor for preventive care than seeing a doctor later with serious   health   problems, which are the most expensive. Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive. Small businesses can survive for they do not need to pay expensive medical insurance, & can hire more people, more income   taxes  , more buyer of goods, thus, envigorating the economy"
2,"Merlinda,You do bring up good points that small businesses would benefit. However, the rest of your argument I believe is false.UHC would not benefit the majority of people.  Most Americans have   health insurance  . I am a little confused with your point on the single buyer and competition.  If you are referring to insurance companies as the sellers than you may not understand the UHC bill.  If you are referring to   health   equipment providers, which I assume you are, then you are mistaken that this would create more competition. Competition increases with more buyers and more sellers.  The more diverse the market, the more competition.  Competition is already a big part of health equipment providers in that a doctor can choose what to prescribe (usually they recommend generics because of price), a physical therapist can choose what wheelchair brand to prescribe, etc. Why will more qualified healthcare workers be selected? They will be paid less, so I would assume that less qualified people would apply for the   jobs  . The more qualified people will want to get paid what they're worth.I would hope that people would be more likely to see a doctor for preventative care but I do not believe this will happen.  If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?  It won't matter if they skip an appointment, they're covered if something bad happens. On the other hand, if a person knows that they are not covered and will have to pay ridiculous amounts of   money   if something bad happens, they will try to prevent that from happening. Overall, I believe a better solution to this problem would be to increase competition by eliminating tax benefits for bulk purchase of health coverage. Reducing the employer based system will increase the number of buyers because people will buy individually or for their families.  Increasing competition between insurance companies will force them to reduce spending and maximize customer base.  AKA let's bring back a free market because capitalism works best while retaining individual rights and freedoms.  AKA capitalism benefits the majority of people (and that's the best we can hope for)."
1," Public insurance is public-private hybrid, not socialized medicine Jacob S. Hacker, Ph.D. ""The case for public plan choice in national health reform"". Institute for America's Future: ""[Public option] is not an argument for a universal Medicare program, but instead for a “hybrid” approach that builds on the best elements of the present system—large group plans in the public and private sectors—while putting in place a new means by which those without access to secure workplace insurance can choose among health plans that provide strong guarantees of quality, affordable coverage.""

1,"In market situation, the sellers, in order to sell must have improved product that buyers are willing to pay, and the seller is able to charge a very high price because the buyer lacks bargaining power. In UHC, there is a single buyer and many sellers, by which the buyer will be able to negotiate with the seller to obtain a mutually satisfactory price. Moreover, the single buyer moves greater competitiveness on the supply side, such as equipment, supplies, medications, and specialized services for seller will improve their product in order to sell.An effective US   health care   system is not just a moral imperative (by which everyone has medical coverage, and care are based on medical need rather than ability to pay, and services are not denied  because it's not covered or you have a pre-existing condition). UHC is also essential to revive the   economy  , and to maintain employees’   health   to continue productivity. Health care costs are a huge burden on the individual, big, and small businesses alike, on the state and federal governments, and for the economy as a whole. With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers? Below are some of the highlights of the BILL ‘‘America’s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009’’ which is self explanatory.(a) IN GENERAL.—there are establish   conditions   of participation for health care providers under the public health insurance option. ?

The organization must have taken reasonable steps to achieve compliance with its standards, such as by utilizing monitoring and auditing systems reasonably designed to detect criminal, civil, and administrative violations by its employees.?	The standards must have been consistently enforced through appropriate disciplinary mechanisms, including, as appropriate,   discipline   of individuals responsible for the failure to detect an offense.QUALITY ASSURANCE AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM ‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—there shall be established and implemented quality assurance and performance improvement program (referred to as the ‘QAPI program’).

2,"but I have read the bill.  No need to try to interpret it for me.You seem to have no idea how a free market works.  I don't want to waste time giving you a lesson in economics because you are not going to trust me as a viable source anyway.  Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever. Unless everyone should get a physical trainer for free or healthy   food   for free or   plastic   surgery for free.  Even services concerning the human body cost   money   because they are SERVICES.  20 years ago, if someone was diagnosed with   cancer  , it was accepted that they would die. Now, not only is it expected that they'll live, but it must be free????  A doctor says, ""I can save your life but it will cost $1,000 for the equipment and the time and the   education   required to save your life"" and people are upset???????  Are they upset that people have developed the   technology   to save them?????  The technology is not free and neither is life.  It costs money to live because money is a symbol that a person has contributed something to   society  .  It is simply a symbol that says ""I have done $20 worth of something for someone else, so here's $20 to you for what you're going to do for me."" What money represents means that it should not be redistributed ""equally"" because by nature, it is already distributed truly equally.  As complex as our society is, the nature and origin of money is really very simple.  Trade."
2,I agree.
1,"Noone is secured to have job or economic security, and ordinary citizens who worked hard for a living and save a lot for their   retirement  , ended up a victim. How could we be sure that our   children  's children will have the same opportunity as we do- having adequate medical insurance because of our job or financial status? Life changes and the economic cycle change, and with this American   economy   is also floundering, hence, the number of unemployed and uninsured Americans continues to rise. Inspite of our advancement in   health     technology  , the uninsured still do not receive the same level of care as the insured. Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs. They often come to the emergency departments with life-threatening illnesses for they could not receive the preventative care nor proper treatment for their chronic illness (i.e. lung disease, high blood pressure, and or diabetes). The US can no longer afford to sacrifice a major portion of its citizenry to inadequate, substandard access to health care.Providing universal access to health care in America would be a major step in improving and removing the disparities of both health and health care currently reflected in our health care system. Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans. UHC plan based its argument on the premise that the health care system can be cured by taking the profit motive out of the system - as other countries do. The current HMO/PPO bureaucracy consumes almost 30% of all the dues designated for health care, to echelon of administrative bureaucracy. Insurance companies have entire departments whose only function is to find ways to deny payment. Conversely, hospitals have entire departments trying to be paid from insurance companies - now that is a waste of precious resources. By reducing this bulging bureaucracy, an estimated $140 billion could be saved annually, leaving more than enough funding for the uninsured and the underinsured. A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."
2,"""Noone is secured to have job or economic security, and ordinary citizens who worked hard for a living and save a lot for their   retirement   , ended up a victim. How could we be sure that our   children   's children will have the same opportunity as we do- having adequate medical insurance because of our job or financial status?""  Simple answer - we can't be sure.  Nobody has ever been sure and nobody will ever be sure.  The best solution is to teach your   kids   how to work hard and do well.If we provide   health insurance   ""for free"" (which simply means the cost is hidden from view in   taxes  ), it will not encourage people to work hard for it.  Then we would end up with a country full of lazy slackers... oh wait, that sounds like my generation.  oops, already happened.  It's really a simple concept:  if you were offered $5 to mow a lawn or $5 to do nothing, which would you choose?  If applied to the general population, how many lawns would get mowed?  And let's not fool ourselves here, reality is what we live in.As for your arguments about uninsured Americans, why are they uninsured?  They cannot afford it.  Why can't they afford it?  Because they don't make enough   money  .  As I explicitly pointed out earlier, money is a symbol.  So the real reason is because they don't contribute enough to   society   to purchase   health care   services from someone else.  Therefore, the uninsured Americans do not earn insurance, and they shouldn't have what they don't earn.  End of story.""UHC plan based its argument on the premise that the health care system can be cured by taking the profit motive out of the system - as other countries do.""  I have a lot to say about this one.First, we cannot compare America to other countries.  We are bigger, more divided, more diverse, and more free.  It's apples to oranges.Second, taking the profit motive out accomplishes several things, none of which cure our system.  It takes out the motive to keep spending down.  If there is no need to turn a profit, there is no need to cut spending, ever.  It also reduces the motive to keep consumers happy.  Happy customers means returning customers means profit.  No profit means who cares if the customers are happy.  Especially scary in this case because we will be paying for it whether we accept the gov insurance or not (again, the cost is shifted out of sight in taxes, it doesn't disappear)  Taking out the profit motive in no way at all guarantees reduced administrative costs.  Third, if UHC based its argument on this premise, it is clearly a very very stupid idea.Good job using CA as an example.... wait, aren't they bankrupt?  Yeah, good idea, let's do that!To point out why they are bankrupt in a very simplified way:They increased taxes on the rich so much that the rich people got fed up and moved out (rightly so).  They stopped raking in money because there was no money left in the state.If taxes are increased still further for the rich in the whole country.... AND if the quality of their health care decreases....  do you really want to piss off the people that pay for your government????  The people that actually have money to spend in this country????""This will make health care affordable, cheaper and provide access for all.""I hate to sound cold because I care about people so much that I actually want this country to thrive, but why do we care about ALL?  It's so... socialist. (the stage following capitalism in the transition of a society to communism, characterized by the imperfect implementation of collectivist principles - dictionary.com)"

1,"So I've been here for a while now. I'll happily tell you about exactly what socialized   medicine   is like. First of all, you get a card. It's got a number on it, and you have to give that number to them for everything.So I've had to go to the ER a couple of times. There was indeed a wait. It was very long when it was very late at night (about an hour) and quite quickly during the day (10 minutes). I had a CAT scan that I had to schedule a few weeks in advance. I had an MRI that I could get done within 3 days. Medicine is very, very cheap.There are free clinics in the large towns that I spend time in. I go in with any problem, and I can get in to see a doctor within an hour. If I want to go see my doctor, I schedule an appointment just like normal.Now it comes to the costs. 57 Canadian dollars a month, or roughly what my bus pass costs me.Feel free to move. The   citizenship   test is pretty easy."

1,"Private insurers ration as-much or more than public insurance. Critics frequently argue that government-run health care involves the government ""rationing"" health care. Yet, private insurance companies ""ration"" to an even greater extent by denying claims and developing methods for maximize profits, and minimize outlays to those they are insuring. ""Rationing"" in this sense is the core businesses model of insurance companies. How can a government-run insurance option be any worse than this, particularly when it does not have the for-profit motive, so will offer as much health care to as many people as possible?

1,"Because I'm just going to go to town and summarize my position. Just going to town. Hoo-ha. Okay.Health Care is really, really important. It's important to determine whether   health care   is actually in need of serious overhaul, or just a bit of trimming around the edges. I'm going to try and prove to you, with sources and everything, why we need the   public option   that's currently on the table in   congress  .First of all, I'll say that US Health-care is indeed the most technologically advanced health care in the world. I firmly believe that. Unfortunately, all of that great   technology   doesn't do us much good if it can only be used by ten people a year. Living in a country with a high-tech machine that can save your life is meaningless if you can't afford it.So here are the facts.47 Million Americans don't have   health insurance  .  http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/03/04/uninsured.epidemic  .  obama  /Millions more are under-insured.  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/17/business/17health.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper  That's why most bankruptcies in the US are about medical bills.  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31103572  /And a third of people responding to surveys say that they aren't complying with perscriptions because of the cost, up from a fourth about three years ago.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/us/04pharmacy.html?ref=todayspaper  Yes, you can go to an emergency room no matter what. Unfortunately, an ER visit doesn't give you any preventative   medicine  . I don't have a link for this, but if you doubt me please go to an ER and ask for a colonoscopy or a mammogram.The American Cancer Society found that (and this is sort of a duh thing)   cancer   kills more often if you don't have adequate health insurance.  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/opinion/03thu3.html?scp=1&sq=case  +for+providingIf you want the statistical cost of our current health care system, there are three numbers you need to remember. 12,000, 18,000, and 100,000. Feel free to repeat those.12,000 is the number of   children   that would live, not die, each year if the US's infant mortality rate were as low as Japans, Sweden's, France's, Germany's or Italy's. An American mother is three times more likely to lose a child before the age of 5 as a mother in the Czech Republic.  http://select.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/opinion/21kristof.html?scp=5&sq=kristof  +infant+mortality+rate&st=nyt18,000 Americans die every year because of a lack of   health   coverage. They don't get preventative care, timely diagnoses, or specialist treatments.  http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/healthcare/2002-05-22-insurance-deaths.htm  And lastly, the big number--100,000 Americans would survive every year if our health care system did as well on prevantable   deaths   due to treatable   conditions   as health care in Japan, France, and Australia. The US has the worst ranking throughout industrialized nations in this area.  http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN0765165020080108?rpc=28  So that's just death, that just refers to who dies. Who knows who survives the subpar treatment, who lives with chronic injury and crippling pain, a lowered quality of life?So how does that measure up to how much we spend on it?Not well...  http://www.nytimes.com/packages/other/business/20061018health.xls  We spend twice as much as a lot of countries that are outperforming us.So we're at the big problem stage, I hope you/d agree. This isn't something that needs trimming around the edges. Next up? Explaining what Obama is talking about."
1,"I think when it comes to   health care  , pragmatism is more important than ideology. What works, we go with. Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has. I'll explain this concept below, because I think there might be confusion about it.What single payer means is, you pick your doctor. You pick your hospital. Government picks up the bill.We actually already have this in the US. It's called Medicare. Medicaid is SIMILAR, but because I'm a stickler for terminology I have to refer to it as ""dual payer"", in that both the federal and the state government pays for it.I think having a system like this that covers everyone would be...just fantastic. However, it doesn't seem too likely.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/opinion/21sun1.html?ref=todayspaper  So what's being talked about right now isn't that as much as it is a heavily regulated new system of private insurance companies. It's just more regulation being discussed, in an attempt to make insurance from private companies provide affordable insurance to everyone.What progressives would like--what I'd like--is to   add   a '  public option  ' to the insurance exchange system, allowing people to buy into a medicare-type system administered by the government.Why is this a good idea? A public plan would have lower administrative expenses, they wouldn't have profits as their bottom line, and they'd be in a stronger bargaining position to obtain discounts. This would enable them to charge lower premiums. Win win.For example, a public plan could haggle with drug companies to get drugs at bulk discount prices. Medicare is currently forbidden from doing this. Thanks, Republicans!   http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/opinion/26krugman.html?_r=1  Private insurance companies have a lot of--well, I'm going to charitably call them expenses--like CEO salaries, marketing and ad creation, dividends, etc. I'll summarize a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine.""After analyzing the costs of insurers, employers,   doctors  , hospitals,   nursing   homes and home-care agencies in both the U.S. and Canada, they found that administration consumes 31.0 percent of U.S.   health   spending, double the proportion of Canada…Streamlined to Canadian levels, enough administrative waste could be saved to provide comprehensive   health insurance   to all Americans.""  http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/administrative_waste_consumes_31_percent_of_health_spending.php  How is this a bad thing?It's really not, and I'll tell you why it's really not after these important messages from our sponsors."
1,"And I've eaten!OK, so why do we not like this? There's a lot of misinformation being thrown around, and quite frankly, a lot of lies, so I'm going to try and correct the ones I hear most often.First of all, people are calling it single payer. It's not. A single payer system is one where the government pays for everything through tax revenue, like they have in Canada. This is a   public option  .Second of all, people are calling it socialized   medicine  . It is also very not. Socialized medicine is where the government actually owns the hospitals and the   doctors   are government employees. That's what England has. That's what the VA is. That is not what this is.People who oppose this like to tell horror stories about the other countries that have systems like that, single payer and socialized. The best example I can think of is this one.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmm87LytlgQ  Which I'll summarize again. Feel free to act this out on your own.""Morris:  And what's going to happen is the same thing that goes on in Canada.  Because of the long wait for colonoscopies, the incidence of colon   cancer   in Canada is 25 percent higher than in the US.And because the two top drugs we use for chemotherapy for advanced stage colon cancer are not available in Canada because of costs, the death rate is 2 % higher.  41 percent of Canadians die of colon cancer compared to 32 in the US.O'Reilly:  That is one of the most compelling things about your book, is that you deliver statistics that say Americans are a lot healthier than Canadians are in the vital disease category—heart disease, cancer, things like that. Morris:  Let's quantify it.  6 percent lower death rate from heart disease and a 16 percent lower death rate from cancer in the US.  And Canada has more poor people.""There are two possibilities here. One is that Dick Morris is telling the truth. If he is, then you have to compare the survival rates to the amount of   money   going in. Remember, Canadians spend half as much as Americans per capita on   health care  . 6% for 50% less money? Okay.The other possibility is that he's not telling the truth. Remember the 12,000, 18,000 and 100,000 numbers. Also, check THIS out.A large study found that five-year survival rates for many diseases in this country are no better than they are in countries that spend far less on health care. People here are less likely to have long-term survival after colorectal cancer, childhood leukemia, or a kidney transplant than they are in Canada.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/business/economy/17leonhardt.html?ref=todayspaper  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, we spend $412 per person on health care administrative costs, versus an average of $72 for peer OECD countries. Six times as much. Here's a cool graph thing.  http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/publications/healthcare/slideshow/interactive.asp  Something else I keep hearing is about wait times. Canada, the UK, oh the Wait Times. Often there are anecdotes.So I went to Business Week magazine, the INCREDIBLY LIBERAL SOURCE, who was studying the issue. ""In reality, both data and anecdotes show that the American people are already waiting as long or longer than patients living with   universal health care   systems.""  http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_28/b4042072.htm  So remember. We've got the same wait times, but we spend twice as much money. If Canada, France, GB, etc. doubled the money they were spending on health care, it would be incredible. There'd be house calls! Best hospital   food   ever! Wait times wouldn't exist!Now, if we in the US cut our medical expenditure in half, how long would our wait times be? How bad would it get?So why are people ACTUALLY hating on this?Same QM Time, Same QM Channel!"
1,That didn't format well. Sorry about that.
1,"So why do people dislike this plan so much?The New York Times recently wrote:""The prospect of competing with a government plan terrifies the private insurers. But in our judgment, if that many Americans were to decide that such a plan is a better deal for them and their families, that would be a good thing. Innovative private plans that already deliver better services at lower costs would survive. Inefficient private plans would wither.""So if we've got a   public option  , private insurance companies would wither and die.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/us/politics/08daschle.html?ref=todayspaper  Is this a real thing?Some analysts say no, and point to the fact that over half of the states offer state employees the option to buy into a public plan, as opposed to private   health insurance   company products. The PHI companies in these states are still doing fine.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/07/health/policy/07health.html?ref=todayspaper  Some maintain that the state coverage model above isn't an applicable comparison to the nationwide coverage option.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/health/policy/07plan.html?ref=todayspaper  Some, like me, hope they're right and that the public option is a slam-dunk that beats out the corporations. Better coverage at lower costs? That's a win. Not because I'm a leftist (I am) but because less people will die and more of us keep our   money  .And what I'm describing, what's on the table, is actually pretty popular. 63% of Americans like it.  http://mediamatters.org/columns/200906190026  Sorry, make that 72%.

Wiener from New York to end Medicare, didn't get any votes.I'm still going with this, so keep watching."
1,"Why would republicans like this?There are two reasons I think that Republicans could be sold on this idea.Reason one is, if people are covered without being tied to an employer, they'll feel less tied to a particular company. No fear of quitting for fear of losing the   health   coverage. This means more people can quit, start their own businesses, and be entrepreneurial. Go Capitalism!The second reason is that as long as corporations are paying for   health care  , they're at a competitive disadvantage with foreign corps who don't. Let's level the playing field.Insurance is a middleman. It drains resources, skims profits, and slows things down. market-based insurance is what got us here in the first place.I like bipartisanship. But when all bipartisanship does is take the teeth out of a program,   water   it down so that it's doomed for failure, then there's really no need for it.Here's a quote from FDR.""We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace--business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering.They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized   money   is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me--and I welcome their hatred.""On this site, and in a bunch of forums, I get the hatred. Well, I'm welcoming it. Bring it on. 120 House democrats pledged to oppose any insurance reform plan that doesn't include a   public option  . I want to try and put some wind in their sales.In conclusion, whether you agree with me or disagree with me---feel free to recommend this because I think it's probably the longest comment on this site and took a lot of research."
2,"Yes, my posts all turned up backward because I replied in the order I read.Props for all the research you did.  I still wholeheartedly disagree.Here's one article I came across that summarizes my entire point of view.  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204251404574342170072865070.html  In the end, perhaps we agree to disagree.  But that is why you are in Canada and I am still in the US where   taxes   are lower and   health care     technology   is better.  I believe I have more opportunities for a better quality of life and I believe someday I will be able to afford the best health care in the world (if the moochers don't hold me back too much)."
1,Not sure how this flew under my radar Quantum.  It's quantity is only outdone by it's quality.
2,"""First of all, people are calling it   single payer  . It's not. A single payer system is one where the government pays for everything through tax revenue, like they have in Canada. This is a   public option  ""So what is a public option?  Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare..."
2,"""What   single payer   means is, you pick your doctor. You pick your hospital. Government picks up the bill.""government = everyoneIf we could ""buy into"" the   public option  , I'd be all for it.  But we can't.  We all pay no matter what.  I just checked my old paycheck stubs... I paid 245 for medicare in 2008. I have no   health insurance  , I am struggling to pay rent, and I can't afford   textbooks  .  I live off of ramen and pasta because they're the cheapest I can get.  How is this fair?  I'm paying for some old person to live a little bit longer when I could be buying textbooks and saving for a car.  Even worse is   social security   which I paid 1043 in 2008 and which I expect to see none of when I retire because the country is bankrupt.  Total in   taxes  , I paid 3382 in 2008.  I am a model citizen in graduate school, planning on being a   college   professor, never broken   the law  , working as a full time TA to get through it, and I am in serious debt right now because I can't afford living expenses.  This is all easy for you to say up there in Canada but you don't know what it's like for college   kids   and grads right now who can't get   jobs   and whose parents are losing jobs.  Taxing everyone more is not going to help.  I'd rather have the cash to spend where I choose than to have public   health care  .  Again, If we could ""buy into"" the public option, I'd be all for it."
1,"US has existing examples of public insurance, public-private hybrids.Tom Daschle. ""A public plan will reduce costs and improve access"". Newsweek. May 2, 2009: ""A growing number of Americans already get their health care from a public plan, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Plan (the Department of Veterans Affairs, of course, also provides benefits). There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management. The use of a public plan as it is currently proposed is simply an extension of what we have already done in public policy during the last 50 years. We just have to circle the bases."" This should dampen concerns that a public plan is somehow ""foreign"", and a dramatic attempt to socialize medicine.

1,"Being a poor student sucks. I agree, I know the pain, my   student loans   speak for themselves. But you ask a valid question. Why should we pay for something we don't ourselves use? This, unfortunately for us as individuals, is just sort of the way things work out.The higher   taxes   thing is debatable. It's not so much about country charges the highest percentage of   income   on average per citizen, you also have to take what's provided into account. France is often cited as high tax hell. So take your taxes, but   add   this stuff to them. The cost of   health care  . The cost of university--whatever one you can get into, even Yale or Princeton. Maternity leave for a year. Two weeks paid vacation a year. So if we added all of that stuff onto what you pay in taxes, you'd find that you actually don't pay as much for what you get as a french person does.Now, you can argue against UHC on two fronts, it seems to me. The first is practical, or ""This plan won't work!"". The second is ideological, be that ""This is immoral"" or ""This is Unamerican"" or what have you. I think you're trying to take the latter side. So my question is, how is this different than, say, the fire department or the army? I've never needed to call either of those in to rescue\invade something. I spend much, much more on those than I do on health care. How is that fair?"

We are better off with privatized   healthcare   and medicaid. "
1,"Efforts to create a public-private insurance hybrid are in good faith. There is no reason to believe that the intentions of those that are advocating for a public option are bent on destroying the insurance industry and creating a single-payer system. It is true that there are many advocates of a pure single-payer system, but there are just as many advocates of a hybrid system. Those that propose such a hybrid - through a public option - should be taken on their word, instead of called liars with a hidden agenda. 
"
1,"I'm interested to hear how you define ""corrupted"" in reference to government. If it's the search for personal gain in a public field, I agree that it is semi-corrupted. However, corporations--that's their raison d'etre. They're profit driven. Fully corrupted as opposed to semi corrupted. Why do you believe a company out to make a buck is more likely to take better care of you than the government? Same thing with efficiency--Insurance companies have marketing departments, CEO salaries, etc. to cover with the   money   you put in. UHC would have none of that."
1,"For sure we should have Universal Healthcare the insurance companies can be in the car, house and life insurance business but not in the   health care   business. I want my doctor to decide what treatment I should have not the for profit health care insurance we presently have. The Health care insurance profit more by denying we the people coverage, Universal Healthcare is practiced in most of the other nations I know England, Canada, France, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries have it why not here.  I was born in England where they have Universal   healthcare   and it works perfectly there. My Dad who passed away was able to stay at home through his illness as his Doctor came and visited him even on a Sunday and it did not cost my Mother a penny.  My Mother who lives in England is now 85 and she does not pay a penny for her doctor or   medication  . Old people should be taken care of, they work hard and pay their   taxes  .  I have worked hard all my life and paid my taxes I want to be assured  I will be taken care of when I get old. I   exercise   and try and eat right. UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE is what we need in this country"
2,"As usual you socialists dodge the need to justify that healthcare is a right, or prove that it's the moral thing to do. Let's hear it. Here, I'll get you started... ""You are your brother's keeper....""That's the only justification ever offered for socialism, and it's still not an argument. Why am I my brother's keeper? For one that's insulting to my brother; for another it means my enslavement. We are not born in to servitude, we are born as unique individuals, each with our own lives, our own minds, and our own goals. The essence of morality is for us to use our minds to support our lives, to make our own judgments, to produce the values that our lives require. It is not to force others to serve our needs. A moral government is one that leaves people free to use their minds and act on their own judgment. This is still America, not the Soviet Union. ""Universal healthcare"" really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else. It's mass enslavement and as far from moral as you can get. And because its immoral it is impractical, as any attempt at socialized medicine around the globe has shown. If you want to concretize what socialized medicine would be like imagine the intellectually demanding, and technologically advanced field of medicine run by the geniuses that run the post office, or the Dept. of Motor Vehicles, or our dismal school system. There will be waiting lines, there will be rationing, there will be monumental incompetence and arrogant bureaucracy. Do you want to put your life in their hands? Well you have the right to subject yourself to that, but leave the rest of us responsible adults out of it.  "
1,"You're absolutely correct.  You exist solely on your own and in no way do you owe anything - not one single thing - to any other human being.  You are an island.  You have your own mind, your own goals, and your own life that exists in a bubble.   In no way is it ever possible that man survived by being a social animal... and in no way is society derived out of being social towards one another.   That would have been mass enslavement, and no one would have ever done it... because no one man ever needs another to survive.  There's no such thing as society and *if there was* it would only exist as a slave market.  The essence of morality is to be purely selfish - which means that no one else on the entire earth matters except yourself; that is exactly what it means to always act in self-interest.    The values that man requires is not contingent upon another human being in any way, shape, or form.  Society is evil, as is socialism, as is anything that forces any one man to have to interact with others.  Because you are correct, Nigel - you're an island with your own mind, your own goals, and your own life.  And might I point out that one of the arguments that is used against Universal Health is that there are currently waiting lines, rationing, and monumental incompetence and arrogant bureaucracy (glad you spelled that correctly, first).

2,"That was easy. I'm glad you agree Betty. Maybe you should think about changing your username? ;)I do not say that I exist on my own, or that society is evil, those are your words, nor do I claim that I don't benefit from cooperating with others in society, so all your sarcasm against those positions is misdirected. My position is simply that all individuals should be free from coercion, that all social interactions should be voluntary not coerced. (A society that is coercive, e.g. socialist, islamofascist, etc., is evil.) So of course there are enormous benefits to living in a society, but only if it is essentially free. That's why people selfishly flee Cuba and come to the United States. Tellingly, under a fully capitalist system you could have your own micro socialist system, e.g. a collectivized farm (kibbutz) or a socialist healthcare system; but under a fully socialist system a micro free market system would never be tolerated. The reason is that under capitalism the individual is sovereign, and so can be a capitalist or a communist or whatever, the state is only there to protect his freedom. Under socialism there are no individuals, only meaningless cogs whose obligation is to serve the collective as prescribed by the omnipotent state.  "

2,"""Morality ends where a gun begins""- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run ""universal health care"" ""the moral thing to do""?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a ""higher"" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest. But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed ""universal health care"", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise. A consumer's right to decide for himself whether and what type of health insurance to purchase; An insurance company's right to determine what insurance products it will offer, based upon its own market judgement; A doctor's right to choose his patients, the treatments to pursue, and the price he will charge; The rights of consumers, insurance companies, and doctors to negotiate and contract voluntarily with each other to mutual advantage; The rights of all people to decide whether, when, what type, and what level of voluntary charitable giving to offer others...these are all merely selfish concerns, according to altruist principles, of no consequence next to a government takeover of a major industry. It's quite all right for the government to trample and sacrifice the rights of people acting in their own self-interest. It's quite all right to sacrifice the earnings, the healthcare decision-making, the careers, the goals, the personal judgements, and the business decisions of private citizens. It's quite all right to hand enormous coercive dictatorial power over other peoples' lives to ""altruistic"" central planning bureaucrats. It is quite all right to bestow unearned benefits obtained forcibly from the sacrificial victims of an altruistic state on those who did not earn them, but for whom it is apparently o.k. to selfishly accept their stolen property. Well, the game is nearing an end. Tyrants, ""social justice"" totalitarians, humanitarians with a ""good cause"" in one hand and the lever of a guillotine in the other, and all manner of politically-connected do-gooders have been riding the altruistic gravy train long enough. All of the ""should be"" goals listed by the National Physicians' Alliance are desirable when taken out of context. But a government that attempts to achieve those ends can only do so through the power to loot and enslave, which ultimately leads to the opposite results. It is an immoral government. So now let it be said. No one who would use initiative physical force, including ""democratic"" or ""legislative"" force, against his fellow citizens to achieve his ends…no matter how worthwhile…can wave the banner of morality. That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do."
1," If you really want to be a follower of Ayn Rand, it might be better if you *think for yourself*. Reason and observation are key elements to her philosophy.  So let's use them.Look at history. Observe the past.  How did we even get to be where we are today in this nation? Is not the notion that all men are created equal a direct affront to anti-socialists?  How does any nation overcome the tyranny of the ruling class under which the masses suffered?Look at the history of man and how we gotten to be where we are today. History keeps repeating itself because there is this lie that has been believed that it is wrong to accept the enslavement of a small group who holds power over the needs... not wants... of all society - all men.  That socialism in any shape or form is wrong.   Capitalism is fine for the things that we want, but do not need.  It is what promotes the middle class and tears to pieces Marx's theory.  But history has shown us what occurs when what humans need is held up for sale to the highest bidder and those who can afford it.  History has also shown us that those who control those supposed ""markets"" of what is strictly a need are also the ones who can afford to exert such power and the abuse they reek upon the rest of SOCIETY.  En mass.  When one small group holds power over the needs of the masses, it is not the masses who are enslaving themselves to make the ""need"" available to all; it is the small group who holds the power who holds the masses enslaved to their own desires. It is slavery of the small, controlling power over the general public.  And when those powers exist in a capitalist society,  the desire to obtain more.  Capitalism breeds excess.  I love capitalism.  It has given more opportunity to more people than in any other system.  But it is not perfect.  There must be balances to this. These balances must occur in the needs of men.  We must balance out capitalism with the knowledge that history has given us - the needs of men are not for sale.  They must be available to all people.  Food, Water, and yes, Health care.    These are basic rights.  The denial of these rights by the people who control them have led to revolution after revolution... some violent and some more of an   evolution   than a revolution.   It is reasonable to assume that health care is a need and a right.  It is reasonable to assume that it is affordable, and well within our collective means.  We have survived as a species by working collectively.  It isn't altruism.. it was necessary for survival.  Looking out for your neighbor means that he will look out for you... and if he doesn't, the guy on the other side will.  Provided you're not a complete douche (which is the point of why it's not altruism to look out for your neighbor, but is actually done in self-interest).  Reason and observation will also show you why it's a good idea to have a healthy ""herd"". "
2,"Socialistbetty's reply to my commentary exposes the fundamental philosophical choice America faces...collectivism or individualism. Due to the importance of this conflict to America's future, and with space being limited here, I have written a detailed response and posted it to my blog at:  http://principledperspectives.blogspot.com/2009/01/rebutting-socialistbetty-point-by-point.html  But let me make these points.Socialistbetty distorts the meaning of that glorious phrase; all men are created equal. The equality of all men (and women) refers to the unalienable rights of each individual to his life, liberty, property, and pursuit of his own welfare and happiness. Those rights are possessed equally, at all times, by all people, under all circumstances, protected equally by government; they can be forfeited only by violating the same rights of another. These rights are not a guarantee of the material success of any individual, only the right to take the actions that one deems necessary to achieve material success through one's own productive efforts and in voluntary association and trade with others. The equality of all men under the law is the essence of capitalism.Since all rights are unalienable, the violation of the rights of one single person necessarily negates the same rights of everyone else, including each and every individual member of any group such as the ""collective"", the ""herd"", the ""masses"" and ""society"". And if no one possesses rights, then the state is all-powerful. This is the totalitarian premise, the ultimate logical consequence of which is Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany.  If this is the ideal Socialistbetty is going to embrace, then she should have the courage to openly admit it, rather than claim the lie that ""the masses"" can benefit under a slave state. At least, though, I give her credit for acknowledging that ""universal healthcare"" is slavery. No other advocate of socialized medicine that I know of has ever admitted the obvious fact that they are calling for ""the enslavement of a small group""...the doctors (among others).The view of man the individual (my view) as the standard of value with regard to social organization is an historically recent discovery that is consistent with the metaphysical facts of nature and, thus, leads logically to capitalistic freedom. The collectivist premise (her view) is a primitive, mystical doctrine that dismisses actual, individual human beings as valueless, sacrificial fodder for the ""needs"" of some ""higher power"". Modern collectivism merely replaces a supernatural God as that power with some group called the ""proletariat"", ""society"", ""the masses"", the ""master race"", etc., to which the individual is subordinate, and which leads logically to totalitarianism. Reason and observation will show you why it's a good idea to have a healthy society of free individuals, not a collectivized slave state. "
1,"First of all, what you - Mike Zermack - are doing is taking my words and distorting them by putting them in sentences I never had them in.  So it's interesting that you should I am distorting things (and am wrong for doing it, even though I'm not) when you appear to be a master at that. What's that called? Hypocrisy?  Hmmm.  Second of all, how can I distort the glorious phrase when I have made no mention of it? What Mike Zermack is doing is firstly putting words into my mouth (or... keyboard? We'll have to invent a new term for that, I think) and the informing himself that I am wrong about something I have never said. Mike Zermack is further assuming that it is lack of material success that leads to a person's illness, poor health, apendicitis, pneumonia, or any other such thing.   Mike Zermack further leads us to believe that a person's health is not his welfare.   He further ignores the part of that ""glorious"" document that gives us the words (which I have not mentioned, at any point until now) ""all men are created equal"" that ensures our government shall ""promote the general welfare"".     Mike Zermack fails to grasp is that a government ""of the people, by the people, and for the people"" does not promote individual rights, it promotes the rights of ALL the people... for to promote only individual rights acknowledges that we are not created equal. To do so would be to go against the very nature of those words.  This doesn't mean that there are no rights OF the individual, but that promotion of the rights of all people is equal.  ""Of the people, by the people, and for the people"" requires that we work COLLECTIVELY. TOGETHER.  Synonymous for what? United? Hmm. Eeenteresting. Ze Germans would have agreed (but since most of the ruling families have had connections to Nazi-ism, it's not surprising). Further more, by allowing the ""free market"" - which everyone agrees does not work the way it should (for the same reason, incidentally, that communism can never work... greed and corruption) - to provide and promote (in a half-assed, greedy and corrupt manner) the general welfare instead of the government (which Is the people) and the health of ALL people suffer.  For the right of this is then limited to those who Have achieved excess in their pursuit of material success.    Again, as though lack of material success means that one just doesn't have accidents happen, or emergencies occur.   As though people who are poor don't work hard.   Because THAT's not a fallacy. Now thank you, Mike Germack, for not only attributing to me things I did not say, but also taking things I did say completely out of context so badly as to make you a LIAR, and a delusional one at that.  You know exactly what I meant...  but kudos again for being an ass about it.  Universalised health care doesn't mean doctors will be not be paid, or be paid less... it means that anyone who needs to see a doctor can.   So doctors will not be enslaved.  As it stands, the wealth of this country rests in the hands of the very few, who exert their control to keep it a very small group.  THAT is what I meant, and you know it. You also know I'm correct... but to do so would be to acknowledge to you small mind that perhaps the system we've been operating under doesn't work so hot. Further more, don't be such a presumptuous ass as to make assumptions about MY view because I  don't think Socialism is a dirty word...but is in fact a necessary component to a capitalistic society to balance out the inescapable fact that capitalism denies the rights of the individuals because it promotes power above individual rights; because  capitalism simply abuses human rights WHENEVER it can get away with it.  Because it is NOT perfectly functioning.  Or maybe you missed the part of that post where I said I liked - for the most part - capitalism?    Not surprising since you seem to be delusional to the point of thinking I've said anything about equality and that ""glorious"" nicety of all men being equal. The only way we can ever move forward and progress towards the more perfect union is to take parts of many different disciplines and combine them.   Capitalism alone does not work. Socialism alone does not work. Communism alone does not work (although I think this is mostly due to size.. the size of the ""community"" is what prohibits the proper functioning).  Relying on one system alone is the surest way to a dead civilization.   "
2,"First of all, capitalism and socialism are complete opposites and you cannot have both.  They are opposite concepts of societal economic policies.  Therefore, since you obviously lean toward socialism in your opinions, the fact that you say you love capitalism is completely hypocritical.  The reason capitalism works better than any other economic policy is because it benefits more from greed than any other.  Greed causes people to work hard and earn their share in a capitalist   society   which benefits because products are made and services are provided to earn that   money   people greedily strive for.  Socialism enslaves greedy people because they do not have the freedom to keep what they earn and therefore they detest society.  They begin to lose motivation because they cannot keep what they earn and therefore, why work hard?  There is no point.  It is easier to do nothing and mooch off the system because that's what other people get to do.  Greed is natural and capitalism suits it.Next, as an outsider of this conversation, I do not believe Mike made any huge distortions on what you said.  Perhaps you did not say what you meant but he replied objectively and directly to what you posted.  My suggestion would be to try to clarify what you mean instead of getting insulted by a direct response to what you said.As for your apparent belief that the wealthy people of this country try to hold on to their wealth, (""As it stands, the wealth of this country rests in the hands of the very few, who exert their control to keep it a very small group."") this is absolutely not true.  Take a look at some statistics on donations and you'll notice that the wealthiest are the most charitable by far.  Also, the wealthiest provide the most   jobs  , consume the most goods, buy the most   cars  , and pay far more than their share of   taxes  .  Yes, this is because they have more money, but don't you want your employer to have more money than you so they can afford to pay you?  Personally, I want my employer to be the richest man in the country so he can pay me the highest salary in the country...Last point I want to make is that seeking   health care   is indeed a right.  Having it is a right if you provide it to yourself.  Making someone else pay someone else to provide you health care is not a right.  The right to life means nobody else can   murder   you.  It does not mean someone else must take care of you.  People die every day and as long as people are being born every day, that will continue.  What matters is that everyone has the freedom to seek a better quality of life.  Each individual can choose their own path to pursue happiness because nobody's path is the same.  If you treat individuals as a group, that is assuming that they are not just equal but THE SAME.  I strive to be better than my neighbors because I am greedy/motivated/whateveryouwanttocallit.  My motivation makes me better and makes me work harder.  In working harder, I contribute more to society while I get more out of it.  It's a win-win because I do better and society does better.  THAT is the essence of capitalism."
1,"Really?  we can't have both?  Do you know where you live?   Are you aware that capitalism and socialism exist together in not only this country, but in a huge portion of the world?

Wealth and power are kept in the smallest number of hands possible.   Also, you pay more in   taxes   than most billionaires.  Think it's not true?   They will end up paying less percentage wise than their secretaries...   and they'll even admit it.    Nor does being the biggest player mean you pay your employees the highest salary.  Or am I wrong and minimum wage does not exist?   But really... the point of this is is that you think you're better than everyone else.  You're not.  You may be better AT things... you may very well be a great lawyer.  You could be the best damn midget wrestler the world has ever seen.  You may be the shiznit at small engine repair.     You're missing the point.This country does not say ""by the corporations, for the corporations, and of the corporations"".  We have no duty to protect the interest of private companies.  We created this country to protect the individuals...  all of them....  from greed and corruption whenever possible.  True conservatism does not hate government.  True conservatism recognizes that there is a need for government.  As   society   has gotten larger, why do you expect government to stay the same size?  As more changes in the world, why do you not expect the government to   change  , as well? The government provides FOR the people.  People.  You apparently do not like this.   If you don't like this idea, you don't like the United States of America and the ideals it was founded upon...  again... ignoring the fact that it was basically a group of rich white guys who didn't want to pay taxes.  We've ignored that fact since we could print text books and lie about it, why stop now?....    well...  move to China.  That's where everything's made anyway.  If you're going to sit there and say that you think a child does not deserve   health care   because his parents work at Burger King and Walmart, you are disgustingly wrong.  If you are going to say that the parent who works at Burger King and Walmart doesn't derserve to be treated for illness, you are wrong.   You are saying that they are not the human equals of the woman who processes paper work at your district court.  You are saying they are not the human equals of yourself.   You are no less or more of a person for wanting to keep your   money  .   But you gladly give your money up for roads you do not travel on,   water   you do not drink, garbage that isn't yours, libraries you will never enter, etcetera etcetera etcetera.  You gladly pay for the health care of   senators   that don't give a crap about you, and millions of other federal employees that don't do a damn thing for you. Why then do you seem to have such a huge problem with providing for the general welfare of the citizens of this country?  You apparently have no problems unless it involves the words ""health care"".  Then you go ""Hey... w-w-w-wuh wuh WAIT a minute!!!! That's socialism!  We're not a socialist country!!!""  And then you drive on roads, drink from municipal taps, etc. etc. etc.  I think that's just slightly misguided (okay, very... ).     What a person does is not the question.  We can't all be actors. We can't all be librarians, or   doctors  , or the guys who change the   oil   in your car. Fortunately, we can't all be fast   food     workers  .  We're not all going to be ambulance drivers.   Society functions with all its parts.   The people you are saying don't deserve to not go into   bankruptcy   and lose their homes are the people you depend on.  These are the people you are saying ""F*** you.  You don't deserve anything.""  They place your calls.  They monitor your streets.  They clean your toilets.  They serve you lunch.  They guard you while you sleep.   And you are trying to say that they are not the human equivalent of you?  Or the entire 111th Congress?  Or me?   You are not better than anyone else. You are another human.  Whatever it is you choose to do in life....  do it well.  But if all you end up being (profession-wise) is a janitor, you deserve to not lose the home you worked just as hard as I did for mine (and Bill Gates for his), because your wife fell ill.

1,"By the way...    in striving to be better than your neighbors... what does that actually mean?That you can buy more things?   That you work harder to buy more stuff?

I didn't buy a flat screen from Best-Buy where the guy who might've sold it to me is barely making it (but hey...  those rich guys pay the highest salaries... or... don't they?), but I bought season tickets.  And everytime I go I'll be spending   money   where it stays local and more people benefit from it.   Does This make Me a better person?

I don't have time right now to go find the statistics that I've mentioned but maybe later I will get around to posting the link.""We created this country to protect the individuals... all of them.... from greed and corruption whenever possible.""  We created this country to protect individual freedoms.  Each person in this country is free.  That means they may keep what they earn and do what they want as long as it does not impinge on another's freedom.  We did not do a very good job protecting from corruption because the government is full of it.  Accepting bribes, swaying voters by lying to them, creating laws for   unions  ... all corruption and out of control.  As for companies, very large ones may become corrupt obviously but without business we have no   economy  .  In general, most businesses supply a good or service without corruption in exchange for money.  ""We have no duty to protect the interest of private companies.""  Yes we do because private companies supply   jobs  .  Jobs mean   income   for individuals.  Without private companies, everyone goes bankrupt.""As   society   has gotten larger, why do you expect government to stay the same size?"" I don't.  I expect it to grow in proportion to the population to serve and protect.  I do not expect it to grow faster than our population and spend billions of our dollars to ""stimulate"" us.""The government provides FOR the people. People. You apparently do not like this."" What I don't like about this is that you say ""provides"".  I prefer ""protects and serves"".  The government does not and should not feed us like mice in a cage.  They should also not trim our nails and give us ""  health care  "" like house cats.  We are not   animals   because we can take care of ourselves (I can anyway).""If you're going to sit there and say that you think a child does not deserve health care because his parents work at Burger King and Walmart, you are disgustingly wrong.""  That's your opinion.  In my opinion, everyone has the freedom to work and earn more money.  It is not my fault they work for minimum wage or my responsibility to pay for other people.  I never anywhere said that people are not equal.  Everyone is CREATED equal.  What they make of themselves (because luckily we have the freedom of choice) is up to them.  As it is up to me what I do with my life and it is up to you what you do with yours.  A murderer is not equal to a doctor in my opinion because they chose different paths.  They cannot be treated the same because society benefits more from the doctor's life than the murderer's.Free market economy is fair and just.  Here's an article to help explain my point.    http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/the-free-market-is-not-another-form-of-rationing  /""What a person does is not the question.""  Yes it is.  If a person chooses to contribute to society, they receive money in return.  If a person chooses to be lazy and do nothing for anyone else, they don't get money.  Another article, this one written by me.  http://hubpages.com/hub/Money---Examining-the-Concept  ""The people you are saying don't deserve to not go into   bankruptcy   and lose their homes are the people you depend on. ""  Yes, they are.  And strangely enough, I would pay them for their service...  Except at the moment I can't afford to purchase their services.  I would if I had a job at one of the big corporations you so despise.... but for now I guess they're unemployed because so am I.

2,"We should all do our very best to lend a hand to help others, I'm all for that, but to let the Government oversea it and manage the   money  ! and schedule surgeries?  Please, wake up!  Obviously, some of you have no idea what that means.  I used to process Medicare insurance claims, what a joke.  They decide what they feel is medically neccessary, not you or your Doctor!  If they don't want to pay the claim, well it's final, it's not open for discussion and/or negotiations, it's just what somebody in the Government decided. Period.And when they do decide to pay, let me give you some examples:1>Flu Shot $15  Medicare approved amount $3 paid at 80% $2.40 to the DR.Doctors out of pocket cost $10 plus labor for the nurse, overhead exp, etc. - And the Dr. must write off the balance of $12, the patient is billed $.602>Office visit $100, physical therapy $50 - Total billed $150Medicare allowed $24 @ 80% $19.20 on the office visit, $0 on the physical therapy- deemed not medically neccessary.  The Dr. gets a check for $19.20, must write of $76, the patient is billed $54.80Who do you think wins here, right, the Government should, only they have paid out double or triple just to process these small checks!!When you have to call Medicare with a question, and trust me this happens frequently, you are only allowed to ask 3 questions, if you have 4 questions, you can ask the 3 and then hang up and call back, wait on hold another 45 minutes to ask the 4th question.  If you have never dealt with these issues, you simply can't imagine how bad it is, I'm not exagerating, ask around.  Surely you know an elderly person on Medicare, an insurance clerk, anybody that has had to deal with it.  Part 2 - Currently most Doctors pretty much accept Medicare, some because they want to help the elderly, as frustrating and expensive as it is, the paperwork involved is unreal.  That is one reason we keep seeing an increase in the cost of doctor visits, to make up what they are loosing in Medicare acceptance costs.  If it is all Universal Healthcare paid by the Government, you will see a flood of   doctors   stop practicing, it will no longer be profitable and full of regulations.  Just ask your doctor his opinion on your next visit.  We will have a shortage of doctors. Part 3:  We are already seeing   taxes   going up on everything.  Take the sin taxes for example.  One example: Sodas are now going to have a higher tax, because they are unhealthy. What happens when they decide you weigh to much, your too fat to have sugery?  Don't think that will happen, think again, there are already talking about it:   http://usgovinfo.about.com/cs/consumer/a/aathinner.htm  maybe you are the ideal weight, but what your friend, or family member that is 20 lbs. overweight, do you want the Government to deny them benefits?  If you say yes, then what's right about that?So please people, think about it, this is not good for our country!Last but not least, do your research on country's that have   universal health care  , how are they doing? And Canada's system is so great that Canadians leave their country to come to the US for many procedures that they have to wait months in line for in Canada. No less than a board of Canadian surgeons has urged the US not to enact a socialized medical system.Did you know a recent poll said if you are diagnosed with   cancer   you will start treatment in approx. 3 weeks here in the US, in other country's with Universal   healthcare  , the average waiting period for cancer patients to begin treatment is 9 months!  That is crucial when you are diagnosed with the deadly disease of cancer.  But this is standard even for emergency surgery, alot don't even last long enough for the surgery.  So if this is what you want, that is what you will get!   Don't take my word, do your research, cause if universal healthcare goes through, we will probably never be able to go back to the way it was!"

2,"Don’t confuse access to ideal   health care   to access to ideal medical insurance.  All Americans have access to ideal medical care. The problem is affordability.  The rich can afford it, the middle class may go bankrupt, and the poor is subsidized.First we ask ourselves why we pay the most for health care as compared to other rich nations on earth. The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyers’, courts’ and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc. These added cost,  other  than private insurance cost, will still exist whether we have government run   universal health care   or not.Let’s ask ourselves what services private medical insurance providers do for us in return for profits the National Physician Alliance (NPA)   might consider to be hefty? They screen procedures, tests, medicines and services administered to the insured patients, and screen and pay insurance claims. Will expensive bureaucratic government employees be more efficient than less expensive private insurance employees? Will universal health care be run like the US Postal Service, AMTRAK or our public school system?  If we like quality service from privately run medical care provider are we going to pay for both the public and the private plan?

This is expensive, as a problem has to be very severe before it 'needs' emergency care.Expanding coverage will help reduce these costs by treating problems before they become emergencies... and keeping the population healthier."
1,The problem with   health care reform   is it is being treated in the   media   as a choice between Obama's plan or nothing. Being for reform then means supporting Obama.

American is founded on individual rights, the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It's your life and your responsibility to support it and to pursue your own values that make you happy. You do not have the right to force others to pay to support your life. As a participant in an HSA, all I can say is thank goodness for them! Not as good as a free market system would be but a lot better than the HMOs and other quasi-socialized health schemes I've been forced to participate in. People should note, that under a free market system many types of healthcare arrangements would evolve to cater for various needs, including those on low income who cannot afford expensive healthcare. But as this argument shows, the socialists have nothing but hostility to any vestige of freedom in their system, they even want to shut down even the mild HSAs that allow the individual a modicum of control over their healthcare! (This is exactly what's happened in education, people are fleeing public schools to private schools and home schools, and teachers unions have opposed those options too). But don't take my word for it, you can be a victim of socialized medicine in any of the many places that practice it around the globe. I have. Let's be patriotic and keep it out of the United States, and reverse the creeping socialism that is already infecting our healthcare. "

Such values are created by others and are to be obtained only by voluntary trade. Entitlement ""rights"" such the ""right"" to healthcare make slaves of those who are forced to provide the entitlements. A ""right to enslave"" is nonsensical and immoral.

July 14, 2009: ""Opponents of a public option say it will deny Americans the right to choose their own doctors. It's true that some doctors and dentists will choose not to participate in a government-run plan.

2,"Public option forces taxpayers to pay for other people's insurance. Those that decide to keep their private insurance will gain nothing from the public insurance option, and will actually have to subsidize the public insurance option by paying higher taxes.

Such breaches of the individual liberties of taxpayers are unjust.

Is that spelled right?
1,"The article tries to draw a distinction between the cost of healthcare and how much is spent on healthcare. That is playing with words. What it is actually getting at is the difference between the cost of healthcare and its efficiency.As the article points out, most single-payer systems cost between 8 and 12% of GDP whereas the US system is 16% of GPD. Remember that the US GDP per person is typically significantly higher than other industrialised countries. So we are talking about a higher percantage of a higher number. The cost/expense of healthcare per person is MUCH higher in the USA than other industrialised countries.Is this money being spent efficiently? Do US citizens get far superior healthcare to say French, Canadian or English citizens? It is important to look at the figures - not just quote newspaper headlines (especially the Daily Mail!).  The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects."
1,"You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system. An insurance plan is all about spreading the risk.  Private companies reduce their risk by disqualifying people that exhibit risk.  The people who need health care most are the least able to afford or even get private insurance.Yet, we all pay for the consequences of a decrepit health care system. We all pay for those emergency room visits by uninsured people.Or, we can just let people die.  We CAN be that uncaring.  We do have that capacity.Michelle"
2,"This is not an issue of whether or not we let people die.  No one is telling you not to donate to charities that provide help for those that need it. Government control is not the equivalent of caring about people.The fact we care is why we are having this debate, it is not why we must choose universal health care."
1,"The insurance companies have already usurped the doctors by mandating treatments, while leaving the docs liable for the legal ramifications of their practice. Just why are the insurance companies in the way for health care? Money. This is a non-productive health care cost to the citizens. In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals. We would be saving billions if health care were universal, in terms of what people and companies currently pay.More than half of the ""profits"" in the health care ""business"" are being eaten up by insurance companies. They have taken over authority for healthcare and left the liability for the doctors to suck on.Imagine if the healthcare industry didn't have to make the doctors pay for their insurance coverage, and if the public didn't have to pay for the mandated administration costs and directives for treatment of patients. Imagine a place where everyone didn't work for and pay the insurance companies. That is the sweet pot the insurance companies would have us do.Get sick, and who do you call? Some of the insurance companies that are ""supposed"" to provide the health care everyone pays for, would have you get ""preapproval"" to call an ambulance. Too bad the insurance company didn't contract an ambulance company in your region. Too bad you have to wait for the particular ambulance to be available while you have your heart attack. Too bad they rushed you to the closest hospital and not the one on your policy.Too bad everyone is screwed when medicine is run by insurance companies. Doctors, patients, everyone.Get rid of the unnecessary overhead, get insurance companies out of medicine."

But this clearly isn't the case. The US spends more -- vastly more -- on healthcare per capita than the Western national systems, and yet...* Tens of millions of people are not directly covered by the system * Most of these people do not receive good healthcare, because they simply can't afford it themselves* Citizens under the national-healthcare systems live longer* Babies born in the national-healthcare systems are more likely to survive* Citizens under the national-healthcare systems are healthier than Americans* There's no evidence that the enormous extra cost of the American system provides any real benefits over the service received by citizens of countries with national-healthcare systems!"

1,"I hadn't seen this data...very interesting. It just buttresses my point. To say ""Single-Payer Systems Do Not Cost Less Than the U.S. Health Care System"" is clearly not true! They clearly do cost far less than the US system, as the numbers you so clearly provided prove!The US system is dysfunctional in many ways. One reason that public-funding of healthcare in the US is so high is that the US has to treat people who are very sick, who didn't get the healthcare they needed in the first place...they arrive at a publicly funded institution once they are really in trouble. Private hospitals dump very sick people without insurance on the public system. Also, the entire healthcare market has become distorted, corrupted, in the US, with medical procedures and services costing far more in the US than in other countries. This affects both private and public healthcare. I certainly wouldn't say that ""more government funding will fix the problem."" The system needs fixing, not more funding. One thing that has to be done is to remove the insurance companies from the equation, which will lead to immense savings. "
2,"I agree with your point, but I think you missed the original point... the distinction between costs and spending.The original author suggested that Single-Payer systems spend less, not by more efficiency or lack of medical necessity but by political decree.  They cut corners and spend less by denying patients who need services and by reducing payments to doctors.  This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

That’s an important distinction.""They also continue in the article to explain how much of the larger wads of cash SPENT on UHC is eaten up by bureaucracy:""The key distinction is that in the single-payer countries the government, not the market, decides how much will be spent on health care.   That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.   Because there are several valid claims on taxpayer money (e.g., education, defense, welfare, etc.), the government has to weigh and balance them with the funds it has available.   Thus the fact that single-payer countries spend less than the U.S. on health care tells us nothing about their efficiency.

2,"Where is this free market you are talking about?People are not allowed to buy insurance from companies in other states.  Insurance companies have per-state mandates on what services they must cover.  The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.  Insurance itself has become a non-market by removing the need for patients to consider the costs of the doctor's services. The government already pays for 50% of all health care related expenses.What aspect of any of that is even remotely similar to a free market?  The fact that profits and money are involved?  That's a shallow argument.  What we need to is to free the health care market by removing government interference that limits choices and encourages higher costs by making them hidden from the consumer.  People also gain profits from food, in fact, if it was not for that profit you can be certain that food would not be so easily available.Also, no one is denying people health care by refusing to provide it.

Even granting that, this article undercuts its relevance to the larger discussion with this statement:""Thus, there are a lot of profits still being made in the single-payer systems, and there are a lot of nonprofits in the U.S. system.""As near as I can tell (since this article does a poor job of relating to the broader discussion), the point being made is that our system of health care is good because it allows profits, so it positively affects health care.  In the quote above, we see that a single-payer system also allows profits, so we should conclude that it also positively affects health care.  In what way is this article supposed to support the 'no' side of the universal health care argument?  If we accept everything written here unquestioningly, we still end up with no reason to come down on one side of the debate or the other."

My plan is to end the War on US (drugs) and save the money (estimated to be 100 billion a year) and the estimated 50 billion lost in tax income from sales of just Marijuana and pay for universal health care for all Americans. The estimated cost of universal health care is 70 billion so we would have 80 billion left over. So if you take the wrong legal drug you can go to the doctor and get help not thrown in jail to be raped and have you future life destroyed by our greedy out of control so called leaders house/senate.

I have been given control of the life of the health care provider.If there were no people who had a passion for medicine a passion to invest the time in learning the tremendous knowledge and skill, where would this ""right"" to health care be?  Who could you force to provide this right? Doctors and hospitals are not natural resources that appear in our environment like stones and mud puddles.  Arguing over your right to the life of another is not only wrong it is pure evil."
2,"""If I am granted a right to health care then I am granted the right to enslave those who must provide it. I have been given control of the life of the health care provider.""Honest to God, I think pretty much all arguments for government entitlements fall apart with that sentence of reason alone. "
1,"You are currently granted the right to police protection against crime. Does that mean you are ""enslaving"" policemen, or the taxpayers who must provide the money to fund the police? Have you been given control of the lives of your local police officers?Along the same lines, are you ""enslaving"" the military, who provides your national defense? Are you ""enslaving"" judges, who provide your right to a fair trial? Judges and courtrooms are not natural resources any more than doctors and hospitals. If there were no people who had a passion for law and justice, a passion to invest the time in learning this tremendous knowledge and skill, where would your ""right"" to a fair trial be?The fact is, of course, that EVERY right requires ""forcing"" someone to provide something to you. The right to a fair trial requires judges and courtrooms, and taxes to pay for them. The right to not be murdered requires policemen, police stations, and taxes to pay for them. How is health care any different?All rights are based on needs. A ""right"" is simply a basic need that society has decided to satisfy for everyone. We NEED security from crime, so we've decided to give ourselves a RIGHT to it. We should do the same for health care. It is just as basic."
2,"Rights confer only a negative requirement on others.  They can in no way force them to act a certain way.  My right to life in no way infringes or conflicts with any other ""real"" right held by any other person.  Under no possible moral social system did any other have the right to murder me, so I cannot be forcing them by requiring that they not murder me.  I am imposing nothing on a crook by ""forcing"" them not to steal my property.  Just like the military and those in the justice system are not ""forced"" to act on my behalf.  Using their own free will and their own right to their own life they decided to work in that line.  If they had all decided otherwise I would have no ""right"" to compel them otherwise, I would simply have the decision to defend myself or not.  Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.  I suggest you review the fundamental right to life, and the derivative rights liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness.  And ensure yourself that my having these rights in no way imposes any action or duty or requirements on anyone else, the only thing ""imposed"" on them is that they not violate my rights.  That is use physical force against me, they not steal my property, imprison or kill me.Much more on this line can be understood reading Ayn Rand's article ""Man's Rights,"" available for free here:  http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=arc_ayn_rand_man_rights  "
1,"Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people. If (a), then your rights only exist as long as you can defend yourself from violent attackers - so might makes right. There is no other choice. Either might makes right, or you must force other people to pay money for the protection of your rights.Of course the military and those in the justice system are not ""forced"" to act on your behalf - just like doctors would not be ""forced"" to act on your behalf in a universal health care system. I was merely using an analogy to point out that your original argument was absurd. The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like. I suggest you read David Hume, who explains why you cannot derive an ""ought"" from an ""is,"" (which is what Rand tries to do), as well as Jeremy Bentham, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant and John Rawls. They all have different conceptions of rights and provide different arguments to support those views. The point is that the issue of ""rights,"" and the question of which rights are legitimate, is an extremely long philosophical discussion that has occupied hundreds of books. It is unbelievably arrogant to claim that you have the final word on the matter."
1,"The right to life should come with the government dealing with the funding of a state-supported health care system.There is nothing saying that anyone has to be 'enslaved'. Police officers are a requirement, Ambulance drivers are a necessity, Fire Departments are an essential service all funded by public money. They do it because the pay is good and because they like to help people for the most part.I mean Doctors take oaths and such like 'Do no harm' and as a profession they have ethics that dont permit them to walk by a person bleeding on the street with stab wounds without trying to save their life. Just like a police officer isnt supposed to sit by and watch some convenience store get robbed."

1,"Here's the thing.  I'm a Viet Nam vet currently on my wife's insurance, so I'm happy with the system as long as my wife keeps her job.  So the only reason I want universal   health care   is to make sure that everyone else remains healthy and won't contaminate me.  That's my right, to not be infected by some untreated disease carried around by one of the uninsured.  Of course if my wife gets laid off like a few dozen of her co-workers did last week, then I'm totally screwed.  Oh, I'll get health care somehow, but you will pay for it with higher insurance premiums etc.  So thanks for that. Looking to the Declaration of Independence for   legal   precedence sets a dangerous precedent.  It was not ratified by ""the people"", just the signers.  Would Tom Jefferson walk by a pour soul having a grand mal seizure?  Or John Hancock ignore some wretch bleeding to death on the sidewalk from a knife attack?  These were honorable men, and I'll betcha they would all be horrified that a country with so much wealth, and so much medical knowledge and   technology   would withhold it from anyone who needed it.Universal health care doesn't have to mean single payer, or rationed care, or loss of control over your choices of providers.  There's plenty of smart folks in this country and we'll figure it out for you.  Just get out of the way so compassion and common sense can prevail.And having been drafted, I was an enslaved soldier for almost two years.  You're welcome."
2,"I feel a great amount of sympathy for you that our nation enslaved you for two years.  I am firmly, and absolutely, against the draft on moral grounds.Do you ever wonder why everyone gets their   health insurance   through their job?  What brought that about?  Why don't we buy health insurance on our own?  What stops us?  Why can't we buy health insurance from another state if it is cheaper?Here is a great article that I suggest should everyone read.  http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2007-winter/moral-vs-universal-health-care.asp  Please don't let the government draft me into a universal   health care   system against my own will for the sake of someone else's need.  It was wrong in Viet Nam -- It is wrong here.  It is not compassionate, and it is not moral."
1,"Don't worry, I'm sure there are many visions for universal   health care   in this country.  It seems to me that what most supporters want is an outcome where everybody can get and afford health care.  In my case I have had heart and vascular surgery (among others) which make me uninsurable.  I for one support a voucher system which would allow everyone to choose their provider.  The government would have to open their employee   health   system at the voucher price (ie free to all), but private insurers could compete freely for the voucher payment by offering better products.I didn't know you couldn't purchase   health insurance   across state lines.  There are many valid point the ""no"" side bring up.  I would accept tort reform as part of the solution.  The strength of our   democracy  , and this new way to converse called the Internet, is that we can blend the best ideas from all to arrive at a better way.  I wouldn't want anyone to feel they were ""drafted"" into a health insurance system that they didn't want.  I'm sure all employers would love to get the health care benefit off their books.  They could still offer sweeter deals as recruitment tools.  But once this gets passed, watch our   economy   take off.  The potential growth in the GDP could absorb the absurd debt we are forced into.As for the draft.  I didn't go to Canada because I like America and had no reason to believe that an amnesty would be offered later on.  But even so, at the time I believed that countries have the right to conscript armies when necessary.  I'm still thinking a 2 year government service requirement for all wouldn't be a bad thing.  Almost all moral systems allow for obligation to the greater   society  .  But this is a great topic for another heated thread.  I'll read your link later, but I don't cast my argument for UHC on moral grounds, rather on practical and economic benefits which I believe all will enjoy once this paradigm gets shifted."
1,"Okay, I read the article you linked.  Many good points, and many bogus to my thinking.  I think this is the central issue of the decade, and the most important conversation we can have.As the baby boomer demographic bulge moves into the medicare - end of life medical issues era,   health care   represents the biggest opportunity and challenge of our generation.  Just as transportation and computers dominated the economies of the last century, health care will be the economic engine of this one.  Fortunes will be made, governance will be adjusted and at the end of the day our national vision will be to live forever.  And we will be the first generation to achieve that goal.I urge all those opposed to the current what they believe to be the proposed new paradigm to flip their thought process to the contrarian point of view.  Bring new, outrageous ideas to the table.  This is going to happen, that's a given.  Make your insights an important influence on the final (or at least the first iteration) of the solution.So, can we count on your no changing to a yes?"

1,"Your comment regarding the government controlling health care, ""if only to keep costs down."" Which is precisely the issue. My familys health care premiums have risen from $700 a month to $2000 a month in 3 short years with no major illnesses taxing the system, not including copays and deductibles.My friends in Canada say that if you have a serious health issue, such as a lump in your breast, there is no waiting period. The waiting period so often referred to by people opposed to universal health care would be for voluntary surgery and minor medical issues that aren't time sensitive. And even then, as I understand it, it's not much different than a normal wait for a U.S. doctors appointment. In fact, my son just missed an appointment with his allergist due to a family emergency. How soon were we able to reschedule it? 32 days later... somehow I think we probably would have gotten rescheduled sooner in Canada."
2,"Check out the VA hospital system if you want a ""shining"" example of government-run healthcare. It is the most expensive hospital bed in the country, oftem have unlicensed, poorly trained physicians and tend to deliver very poor medical care. I am a physician and volunteered in a VA clinic and it was pathetic. The medication formulary was so limited that I often would go back to my office and FedEx sample meds to the patients who needed tham but the VA refused to stock the meds in order to ""save costs"". This limited view of medical practice resulted in many surgeries that may have been prevented. Many of the VA hospital patients are used as teaching tools for medical students - not a bad practice but as the quality of the staff is sometimes poor the teaching is poor as well.If we go to universal healthcare with the Federal Government as the purveyer of care - we will get just what we deserve - poor care and extravegant costs."
2,"Through the VA system the president of the US and the Congress and thier families recieve the finest health care in the world at Walter Reed medical in DC. The same campus was found to have mold growing on the walls in the rooms that our returning soldiers were being assigned to while they recoup from battle injuries.The government cannot be trusted with something this important. They are totally ineffecient. The red tape ties the hands of the employees that do care and gives cover to the ones that don't.Name one program the government runs without massive waste and corruption, and I will consider your argument for government run healthcare."
1,"The United Nations states under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that everyone has a right to, among other things, medical care. It is absurd to say that impoverished people who are doing all they can to feed themselves and their family should be denied   health care  . It is equally absurd to believe that all 50 million of these people living in the United States can be helped by ""charity work."" Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.         Take this scenario for example: A poor Vietnamese immigrant develops a cough. He doesn't visit his doctor because he does not believe his condition is serious, and cannot afford a regular visit to the doctor. He waits and waits until he eventually coughs up blood. He finally visits his doctor and finds out he has a serious case of TB that has severely damaged his body. He has to pay more for extensive treatment and becomes more impoverished.With a government funded insurance program this scenario would not exist. The man would visit his doctor free of charge. He would be diagnosed early and would receive free preventative   medicine  . And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care. We need to wake up and realize a government run insurance program is the only way to solve our current health care disaster. We must put special interests aside and help our citizens.Health Care is a right. If you disagree with that you disagree with the United Nations' and the United States' definition of Universal Human Rights."

""Three Reasons for the Choice of a Public Health Insurance Plan"". May 15, 2009: ""Putting you first. [...] The mission of health insurance companies is a healthy bottom line, not your health. That’s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

A public health insurance company won’t have multi-million dollar executives with corporate jets. It won’t have to please Wall Street financial analysts. It will have a mandate to provide health care, from preventive care through care for serious and chronic illnesses. And a public insurance plan will invest in health care in our communities.""

1,The question FIRM ask is who should pay for the   health care   of those that can't afford it? But the question is who is paying those cost now? We are. Universal health care will just put some control over thouse cost.

1,"Here is the Obama Healthcare Proposal link (lol, apparently the webmaster who posted this doesn't know how to filter spam comments, that aside, it's the entire bill)First the fear tactics being used by the Isurance industry:1. Death Panels - they don't exist, end of life counseling is simply when a person at any time in their life, (they don't even have to be dying that's just when people do it usually) discusses with their doctor (not the government) what to do in the event of life support, donating organs, etc. All of the choices are the individual's, doctors have no say, the government has no say. As Jon Stewart pointed out very well part 1 part 22. We would pay for the healthcare of illegal non-citizens:Simply not true. There is nothing in this or any proposed bill that would lead one to believe it were true. There is nothing that could even be mistaken for something that could lead to this being true later. It's a lie aimed at a specific group of people to get them riled against the bill.3. They are going to take money away from Medicare:Ignoring that Medicare is a government program and the naysayers should be all for taking money away from medicare - if they were basing their arguements on principle at least - this is not true either. Here is where Medicare is mentionedA. in a pricing section stating a public plan shall not excede the price set in a Medicare program where the price has been set, ie, you can't charge more than medicare charges an individual.B. in defining ""qualified person"" one of the qualifications is to not already have Medicare Part A and B C. again referring to cost, it states pricing should ""substantially"" reflect the pricing under medicareThose are the only scare tactics I've heard so far, but I'm sure there are more, and if anyone is scared by them, feel free to read it yourself or ask me.Now for what it does say, cliff notes, the whole bill is there if you want more details:1. a person cannot be denied coverage for any pre-existing condition2. a person cannot be denied renewal based on anything at all3. prices should reflect prices set in existing government health programs (medicare, medicaid, VA, government employee healthcare, etc) and should not excede these costs and where prices have not already been set should be determined by the Secretary4. healthcare is mandatory for all citizens (the 30 million who don't have it need to get it, kind of like you can't drive without insurance)5. individuals choose their own doctor. An insurance co. can no longer tell you what doctor they will or won't cover, and of course the government does not tell you what doctor to see.6. medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7. no one can interfere with these rightsI fail to see the downside outside of the initial cost, which could easily be compensated by 30 million people paying into the system who currently do not.However, no program in the history of mankind has ever been perfect, and I'm sure there will be problems,but again, we have the worst Healthcare system of the industrialized world. There are third world countries with better Healthcare right now. Every country with some kind of public healthcare has better Healthcare than we do. I fail to see how this wouldn't be much better than what we have."
1,"And to answer Kuk's debate exactly,1. It is fairly socialistic, so is the military, fire departments, police, and education, and those are all good things. It maintains the good properties of capitalism as there would still be the exact same incentives to come up with new cures and the free market is still free to compete. Anyone with funding could still start a health insurance company if they think they can do it better, the ones that exist aren't being shut down. The only difference would be they have rules... which obviously they don't want.2. Support for healthcare reform is actually overwhelming. More people are for it than are for Obama,it's anywhere from 70-77% approval. linkThe health insurance industry is spending millions every day to fight it, and as is sometimes the case with money, it's louder than people.I think though that once people become more aware of the actual facts, and as the proposed bills become more available to the public like that link I provided in the arguement above, that 70-77% will start being more vocal about their support."
1,I've always been in favor of some type of Socialized medicine in the country but I think with all the fighting going on at town halls and such it's hard to know what the bill's attributes are at this point. No one seems to be clear on what should go or what should stay in this reform. I'm confused as heck about it and don't know which side has the better point (s). What is the fuss really all about here?
1,"Being that it is the first answer that addresses the issues of denial of care bullshit, as well as denial of coverage, yes. While I think it will take a few years to get the kinks out once it gets rolling, we will see vast improvements in our total level of health as a nation. Of course, equally important is that we start living healthier lifestyles, but, one thing at a time, I guess?"

2,"The worst part of this bill is that congress is trying to ram it through without explaining what is in the bill. Obama could not explain it. If you are going to pass a bill that is as important ass this one you need to slow down. It is obvious that many Americans oppose the bill, the polls show it and Obama's popularity is tanking because he and his friends on the hill are either mocking or even ignoring the people who have sincere concerns about what this bill will do."
1,There's no one bill yet. There are many different proposals being debated.
2,"I'm only going to answer the question in the title. The national health care reform isn't the answer to our medical problems. The biggest problem is food safety and the american diet. Preventative measures need to be taught to the masses so that we can eliminate the need for much of the reasons we frequent the hospitals. What they are trying to push is system where everyone has the right and can afford health care when they DO need it. I am all for that. The biggest step is not only to address the Health Care reform talk, but to integrate measures that will take some stress off it and put the responsibility of individual health in individuals. Again, this is an answer to your question."
1,"actually, America's Health Care never was the envy of the world, because big corrparations and banks always look for a way to get more for themselfs, and here more than any other part of the world. I'd say Canada's healthcare is the envy of the world because you can have it for free or a cheap on from another country and stuff. Even Mexico has a better health care system than us (if you live in a city with a hospital instead of out in a area with like 2 people per mile)"

If tax needs to be increased or decreased to modify the service to better suit the needs of the population, what exactly is the problem with that? The amount of tax you pay changes often depending on the state of the country and reform to services provided. This is whining for the sake of whining. Anyway, let's go to the actual text to really see what's being said:""MANNER OF NEGOTIATION- The Secretary shall negotiate such rates in a manner that results in payment rates that are not lower, in the aggregate, than rates under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, and not higher, in the aggregate, than the average rates paid by other Qualified Health Benefits Plan offering entities for services and health care providers."" [source]So, you won't be forced to pay any more than the average going rate for healthcare, ever. That is written in to this bill.“Sec. 59b (pp. 297-299) says that when you file your taxes, you must include proof that you are in a qualified plan. If not, you will be fined thousands of dollars. Illegal immigrants are exempt from this requirement.”There is no section 59. It starts at section 101. Incidentally, there is also no 159, 259, 359, or 459 to speak of. Great source you got there Joe.“On Nov. 2, the Congressional Budget Office estimated what the plans will likely cost. An individual earning $44,000 before taxes who purchases his own insurance will have to pay a $5,300 premium and an estimated $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses, for a total of $7,300 a year, which is 17 percent of his pre-tax income. A family earning $102,100 a year before taxes will have to pay a $15,000 premium plus an estimated $5,300 out-of-pocket, for a $20,300 total, or 20 percent of its pre-tax income. Individuals and families earning less than these amounts will be eligible for subsidies paid directly to their insurer.”This is absolute crap. Do you actually read the primary sources yourself or do you rely on poor journalism to give you incorrect facts about the sources?Here is what the report actually says:""CBO estimates that the combination of provisions included in the amendment would reduce average private health insurance premiums per enrollee in the United States relative to what they would be under current law. The average reductions would be larger in the markets for small group and individually purchased policies, which are the focus of many of the legislation’s provisions. In the small group market, which represents about 15 percent of total private premiums, the amendment would lower average insurance premiums in 2016 by an estimated 7 percent to 10 percent compared with amounts under current law. In the market for individually purchased insurance, which represents a little more than 5 percent of total private premiums, the amendment would lower average insurance premiums in 2016 by an estimated 5 percent to 8 percent compared with amounts under current law. And in the large group market, which represents nearly 80 percent of total private premiums, the amendment would lower average insurance premiums in 2016 by zero to 3 percent compared with amounts under current law, according to CBO’s estimates. The figures are presented for 2016 as an illustrative example. "" [source]"

Many people have encountered the unpleasant reality that they can be denied care when they need it most, or lose coverage when they can least afford it.Private insurers can discriminate based on preexisting conditions, health status, gender, age, claims history, or other factors. In addition, in this unstable employment market, the loss of a job often leads to loss of health coverage, as insurance becomes less affordable.""[6]

1,i went straight to their website and the first thing that appears is the budget deficit. For one fiscal year. Bush was bad really bad at 3.1 billion in 2008 but look at Obama 9.9 billion more than 3 times. The website is pretty cool you have to understand charts and some basic accounting. One of the interesting things that popped out to me was the projected deficit increase in billions. It a pretty heavy website. Some other things showind us adding more than 425 billion more to the already high deficit there is just no balancing in sight.

2,"Link to H.R. 3962: http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/House%20Bill.pdf Regardless, the OP is wrong and merely perpetuating fear-mongering. For example, section 59B simply says people without acceptable healthcare (who are eligible for acceptable healthcare) will be taxed ~3%, of the excess of their taxable, gross adjusted income. Basically, you'd be taxed nothing. But acceptable healthcare is described in sub-section (D) as basically any healthcare, including government provided healthcare (veterans affairs, medicare, medicaid etc.). Moreover, the whole illegal immigrant thing is just a disingenuous play on words. The bill would exempt non-resident aliens, which just means that people who are on Visas (as opposed to people with greencards, like me) don't have to have acceptable healthcare to not be taxed."

I want to ask because I don't know but did they leave in the plan that if business keeps their private health insurance that they will have to pay an 8% penalty for not going to the government plan.

1,"I can say from experience that as a former soldier, I had government run health care, and all of my expenses were paid for. I had free medical care, free medicine, free surgeries, free dental, free vision, even breast implants if I wanted. The government run health care that I had was great. They did not do unnecessary tests, they found the cause of the illness and treated it. I did not go to the doctor every time I had a runny nose, and if I did have to have a surgery or other major medical procedure, yes I would need to be scheduled in, but after now being in the civilian world, I find that I still have to schedule to have major medical procedures done, but at a much larger cost to me (with private insurance). Since I am a veteran, I have access to the VA, where I still receive government run health care, which is a benefit to me because it saves me a lot of money. I wonder if anyone has thought about their post retirement age, when medicare (if it is still around) will be something you need to utilize? Isn't that government run? After you retire, unless you are one of the lucky that has for your entire life budgeted your money to save enough to live on after you are unable to work, and still afford private health care, how do you propose to manage? It will be government run."
2,"All I'm saying is that the government should not give handouts. Former soldiers earned their health care. People should not get ""free"" money. They should either have to pay it back, or work for it or something. It shouldn't just be handed to them."

1,"I am a former soldier, but let's just say for a second that I wasn't. Let's say I have been working for a company for the past 12 years and got laid off because of this recession we are in. Now I'm not working, but should I get the ""free money"" you refer to or should I go without because of the turn our economy has taken? I'm sure you are aware of the current unemployment rates. There are thousands of people who are not working from no fault of their own. Or should it just be the homeless that are denied. Exactly who are you referring to that you don't want to have healthcare sir?"
2,"The operative word here is ""free."" And thus the answer is no. You should either have to pay it back once you get back on your feet or do something for the government while you're receiving a check from the government."
1,"Why should she have to pay it back? In the example given, she has been paying taxes in to the system for the past 12 years. So what if she has to take some out due to an uncontrollable circumstance?"
1,"You make a very good point but that is ot what I meant. In the scenario that I envision that would change too. Right now the employer pays the employment tax (not the employee). If they fire someone, the money is used to pay for that person until they get another job. The employer's tax goes up for some period of time with each person they fire. Any money the laid off employee gets is free money. Under the system I envision, the amount of tax paid by the employer is decreased because it gets replenished by the employee."
2,"Under the system I envision, the amount of tax paid by the employer is decreased because it gets replenished by the employee.I see what you mean, but I do not agree with the employer's taxes being decreased. It seems that all your proposals simply help the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.Any money the laid off employee gets is free money. Once again, it is not free money as they pay income taxes."
2,"My goal is not to ""help the rich"" nor do I understand the ""They can aford it, make them pay"" argument either.My goal is to improve this country. As long as a person can go on unemployment and not have to pay that money back, there will be people taking advantage of that situation. If you make it so that they have to pay it back, you give people the incentive to get back to work. Productive individuals are what makes a country great."
1,"I am not disputing that productive people lead to success however, making them pay it back will set them back even further in the long run, therefore, making the rich richer and the poor poorer. It is possible to have strict regulation to prevent people from taking advantage without making them pay it back. Such as, a required amount of resumes handed out and interviews a week, weekly or monthly checkups on people who are unsuccessful at finding jobs and you could even provide access to job placement agencies."
2,It should be enough if they don't have to pay it back with interest. The things you propose are not fail safe. They can cheat.
1,"No system is fail safe. The system you suggest will not really help them at all. It should be enough if they don't have to pay it back with interest. That is just outrageous, they got laid off or are starving so they should be thankful they are drowning in debt just because its not with interest?

June 11, 2009: ""Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance. But 1,300 companies sell health insurance plans. That's competition [and choice] enough. The results of robust private competition to provide the Medicare drug benefit underscore this. When it was approved, the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost $74 billion a year by 2008. Nearly 100 providers deliver the drug benefit, competing on better benefits, more choices, and lower prices. So the actual cost was $44 billion in 2008 -- nearly 41% less than predicted. No government plan was needed to guarantee competition's benefits.""

Maybe he's thinking about moving to the U.S. but doesn't want to give up his nationalized health care or maybe it's because misery loves company and he wants Americans to be in the same boat as the Brits or maybe he's pissed off at the fact that the Americans kicked the English out of the U.S. during the revolution because we just don't like their form of government and he's still trying to force it down our throats.

And, believe it or not, I believe everyone should be given certain rights, whether they're American, British, Canadian, Indian, etc, that's why the fact that this debate is occurring in America is irrelevant to me. America is wrongly held up as a beacon of hope and liberty and something to strive for for developing nations, and that annoys the crap out of me. It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world still does things that defy belief. It annoys me that you try to help Africa with one hand, and implement policies that cripple it with the other. It annoys me that you attempt to fight terrorism, pulling us in for the ride and causing a terrorist attack in my city, whilst at the same time nearly every single terrorist organisation has been funded by the US. It annoys me that, even when your own country suffered a terrible natural disaster, no one cared because it happened to poor people (I'm talking about Katrina). And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.

The fact that every time we enter into an argument, you fall back on comedy rather than seeing through the actual debate. That just solidifies in my mind, with every single debate with have, that my views are right, moral, and justifiable. I can back mine up whilst you fall back into a corner and play the comedian card. At least have the balls to back up your views and see it through.There was a time on this site where you actually used to fight your corner, but I suppose rather than modify your views in response to arguments that are obviously too compelling for you to be able to form arguments against, you'd rather just back down, forget about it, and continue to hold the views you do even though they've been tested time and time again and found to be lacking.Pineapple had you absolutely pegged when she said: ""Based on previous conversations, I am entirely convinced that you know nothing about this bill or the state of the country and the reasons we need it.

2,"As an American I am nauseated, and not a little, about the typical Americans’ sentiment of US holiness. And I find it quite extraordinary that an Englishman has a better sense of discernment about the US than most citizens of the US.

If group A decides that its happiness is Sample B of Healthcare reform, they have no right whatsoever to use their rights of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to trample everyone else’s right of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to not consent to sample B of Healthcare reform. Or stated another way, no man has the liberty and freedom to trample another man’s liberty, freedom, and pursuit of happiness. Ergo, that is why the proposed legislation of Healthcare reform is so hotly debated in the US. The people of United States of America should never seek to impinge another man’s rights of life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness, by imposing their will upon their fellow man for the sake of legislated compassion. And any people who take upon themselves this god-like mandate of legislating ‘loving thy neighbor’ better take in to account that their version of altruism may be the pinnacle of tyranny.My solution to the healthcare issues that plague the US:Eliminate health insurance! It’s simple and subtle, but far reaching. I’ll explain in greater detail if you so request."
1,"I think that there may be an underlying flaw in your logic. You seem to be assuming that allowing everyone healthcare would somehow take healthcare away from someone, it would ""trample everyone else’s right of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" as you would say.I don't understand how this could be. It seems to be the same argument Joe regularly makes that allowing gays to be married somehow invalidates his own marriage.It seems to be a fatal flaw in logic. I simply cannot comprehend what would lead a thinking person toward this conclusion.Even if it did happen, which it would not, that having a public option would lead to higher prices for some, It seems to me the equation, Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness, in no way gaurantees lower insurance rates.In fact, the Life and Pursuit of Happiness parts of the quote you use several times,would imply healthcare would be a right regardless of cost.I mean, it seems people are forgetting we are talking about human lives. Does it matter that some would be poor, or if people like Joe hate them? They're humans still who as far as we know have done nothing wrong.Why shouldn't they have as much a right to life, and as long and healthy a life, as anyone else?It makes no sense morally, or even legally if one is going by the mantra you use continually ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""I'm afraid this constitutional argument simply falls short. There is nothing to lead anyone to believe providing healthcare is unconstitutional, quite the opposite in fact. (I know the quotes from the Declaration of Independence, but typical, the right's calling it a constitutional argument)Okay, so I just don't get that argument at all, and I find it hard to believe you really buy into it... Joe okay, he's a moron, but I can't believe you think it's legitimate.And getting rid of health insurance all together seems an even worse idea. I mean, literally at the most 1% of the world population could afford a simple procedure today like removing breast cancer. And that could be the difference between dying within the year, and living a long happy life and dying of old age. Why would we want that?And how many bright people, if doctors decided to lower costs enough so that maybe 5% of the world population can afford a relatively simple procedures, would still want to be doctors?7-10 years of higher education, and student loans anywhere from 100,000 to half a million. Who can afford that?It seems to me getting rid of any health insurance at all is a one way trip back to the gilded age, where you have a handful of travelling doctors who don't know that much and do it out of the kindness of their hearts.... unless you're talking about single payer national healthcare. In which case you retain your genious status and I'm all for it."
2,"The flaw in your logic is that you think that health insurance is the best and cheapest way to provide health care. Health care insurance means that you are paying for (not only the doctors, the hospital's overhead, etc. but you are also paying for) everyone else that works for the insurance company. A company that's in business to make money. Money that could go towards actual health care instead of the insurance's pockets.But lets follow your logic and see where it leads. Most people don't require health care every day. But the do require food every day. Now, since it is inhumane to let people go hungry, we should have nationalized meals for every citizen (a roast in every pot). But we need people in place to collect the money and distribute the money, etc. We'll call them the Nutrition Insurance Group (NIG). now, they need to get paid for their services but where is that money coming from? Oh yeah, the people. But it now cost more money to feed the same amount of people because we now have to pay for the NIG. No problem, we cut back on their rations (they're too fat anyway) and on the quality of the food. Now once people get used to the idea of NIG, we can raise the price of food because, ""Don't worry about it. The insurance will take care of it."" (I was literally told this by a doctor who wanted to perform what I considered to be a questionable procedure. He was adamant that it was necessary until I mentioned that I did not have insurance.)Or we can leave it (conserve it) as it is (which is why we call ourselves conservatives). A pan handler can get at least $15 a day and get 3 happy meals at Mickey D's ;)And no, I don't hate the poor. I just hate the fact that I am forced to provide for them. Poor people should either provide for themselves or force the Liberals to provide for them (without any help from conservatives ;)."

2," Public insurance leads to socialized medicine, rationing, long-lines ""The End of Private Health Insurance"". Wall Street Journal (editorial). April 13, 2009: ""Once government takes over the majority of U.S. health-care liabilities [with a public option], it can either provide every service at huge and growing cost, or it can ration services. People who need an MRI or hip replacement or whatever will face waiting lines. Medical innovation will be at the mercy of the price controls hashed out in Washington.""

2,"I support you because you answer your own question about why it is I don't bother to back up my position. I can back up my position all day long and I will never get you to see my point of view. You will always think that your views are right, moral, and justifiable.Yes, there was a time when I used to fight and got absolutely nowhere. Lets take the gay marriage issue for example. I have repeatedly stated that I am for gay marriage but that I did not believe that the current approach the gay community was taking was going to succeed. I suggested instead for them to get the government to drop the use of the word marriage and substitute civil union in its place. People bashed me and I was not able to change anyone's mind. Now, here we are and gay marriage proponents have been handed a hard blow in maine.But OK, I'll give it one shot for old times sake. What you want is to be able to force people to do what you think is right. If you think that Nationalized Health Care is right, then you want to force people into it. What I want is the freedom for people to chose. If someone can't chose what they want because they can't afford it, they have no right to force me to pay for it. I don't care about the benefits I will be able to reap down the road. I don't ever want to be forced into something, period. Even if it's good for me."
2,The actual polls just last week Rasmussen polls show only 45% versus 52% appose. I just got that of the Rasmussen which is considered by most the most accurate. I don't know what poll you got 72% from? I think that the one may be skewed. Someone needs to actually go the the CBO or CBC and pull what they said and what numbers they are giving back. that will add some smoke to the gun if what above is true.
2,"Do you know at what time of day the polls were executed?The source fails to provide that data. I mean if they were contacting welfare recipients and the un-employed during daytime working hours I could argue the poll is biased.Polls have very little importance to me, when any."
1,"I agree that that would be a fair argument, had the poll not asked about the salaries and social status of those questioned, which it did. One thing I did notice was a slightly larger number of people who voted for Obama, but also noticed (as a counter-balance) a larger number of people describing themselves as having conservative views. ""Polls have very little importance to me, when any.""I know I may have used it as a source, and I admit it was mainly show-boating on my part, but I agree with that completely. When you understand how easy it is to pose a question to be answered in the way you want it to be answered, polls (and referendums, for that matter) lose any real significance. On reflection, I retract the poll and the argument made with it."
2,Your honesty is a refreshing presence at CD. (I know your argument (main theme) is still valid apart from the poll retraction.)
2,A government run program would eventually monopolize the whole industry. We really don't want that.
1,"The penalty for not having insurance in MA is about $900, and it's actually cheaper to pay the fee than to pay for the insurance. I know individuals who have paid the penalty rather than spend more for the actual coverage. I find that incredibly depressing. Socialist countries such as Denmark are incredibly expensive and the average Dane pays about 51% of his/her paycheck in taxes, but look at the Danes: they're healthy and well tended, have a very high standard of living. In another thought, if our taxes actually went somewhere, went where they were supposed to, I don't see why we couldn't pay for health care or for our university system. Every European I have met scoffs and is incredulous that we have no universal healthcare and that we pay for university. And to further drive home frustration, I am one of those who then gets tangential and thinks about the f*ing war in Iraq and the other heinous government spending we've suffered in the last X many years. Big mess, huh!?"
1,"I would have to agree with the government-based universal healthcare for U.S. citizens because it has proven to be effective in other countries such as France. I also believe that it will allow all U.S. citizens to save money and to be provided with the care that some may need. Without a doubt, our health insurance needs some sort of improvement and universal healthcare may be the answer"
2,"Placing the cost of healthcare upon the shoulders of all of the working class both now and perpetually will not reduce the cost of healthcare. The expense of healthcare is why people can’t currently afford healthcare apart from insurance or medicare. The costs associated with healthcare are not a reflection of the actual costs to provide healthcare, but more accurately are a reflection of the greed for profit that exists within healthcare, pharmaceutical, and insurance companies. We need healthcare that provides reasonable services and products at reasonable prices, not healthcare that compels exorbitant fees at devalued wages. And lastly, the very fact that insurance companies and government, not the patients, are paying for the majority of the cost of healthcare enables the greed of the healthcare industry. Healthcare that only insurance companies and government can afford enriches only the healthcare providers at the expense of the working class. And quite simply is the reason we are in the predicament we find ourselves. Universal healthcare in the U.S. will accomplish nothing but additional problems, for the greed of the healthcare providers can never be satiated and will always seek to maximize profits at higher prices."
1,"I think you have it backwards. Healthcare in this country costs so much because of the profit motive of the capitalist system it operates within, not because of universal healthcare. You can't use existing prices as an argument against universal healthcare when the existing prices were caused by the private system and not a universal one. And your argument about the working class makes no sense at all. The working class is the group most likely not to have health insurance and the most likely to lose everything were they to get sick. The working class would stand to benefit most from universal healthcare, not the other way around.Finally, the greed of the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies can be brought under control pretty easily through UH. In such a system the government would be able to bargain drug prices and lower them with impugnity, as it is by far the largest customer on the market. There is a reason drug prices are so high in the U.S. and so low in other countries with Universal Healthcare."
2,"Public health insurance creates two-tiers of quality. Ronald Bailey. ""The beginning of the end of private health insurance"". Reason. June 9, 2009: ""The best result of creating a parallel public insurance scheme is that the United States would end up with an explicit two-tier medical system in which privately insured Americans have better access to better medical care. Such two-tier health care systems already exist in countries with national health care schemes such as the United Kingdom and Germany. In the United Kingdom, more and more Britons are opting for private health insurance instead of remaining with that country's National Health Service. Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized.""

1,"I agree, but I'm also wondering what people think needs to improve? What are some of the flaws that are apparent in the current system and how will Universal Healthcare fix these flaws? If you oppose Universal Healthcare, what about the current system do you think works well? How is the current system better than Universal Healthcare?"
1,"In Japan, everyone gets equal treatment because everyone gets national health care. In this country, if you have no money, you don't get a good insurance plan which is not fair. In Massachusetts, there is Masshealth for poor people, but it's only Medicare which covers nothing. so if you get into an accident, you will end up paying thousands of money. There are so many people living in this country. I don't understand why we don't have national health care. What annoys me is that medicare and a dental plan are two separate things. I've visiting a dentist because I have to get rid of my wisdom teeth which is a lot of money with no dental insurance. one tooth costs you about 350 dollars. Since I have 4 wisdom teeth, it will cost me about 1500 bucks in total. Do people expect a college student to have that much money? I have 2 jobs, but I don't even get more than $1000 every month. I am really frustrated with American health insurance."
1,"Universal healthcare would eliminate the problems that are posed by privatized healthcare. With it being universal, everyone gets treatment at an equal rate. Taxes would be higher, but the benefits would be better. Take Sweden for example, where a person can walk into a hospital at any moment and get treated without the gratuitous amount of paperwork, or questions like, ""Who's your insurance carrier? How much does your plan cover?"" etc. Besides, most countries already have universal healthcare."
2,"OK, it would get rid of some problems with the current health care system, but it would create a whole new set of problems.Look at the other countries that have Universal Health Care. Let's take your example, Sweden. Sweden has a reasonably manageable population of around nine million. That's about as much as one of the many large metropolitan areas in the United States. The Sweden government does not need nearly as much money as the American government would to supply its population with health care. The American government can't even afford the services it offers now. If this were passed, taxes would be outrageous. The country would either take more and more of its citizen's money, or become trillions and trillions more dollars in debt."
1,Okay then lets make a list of countries closest in population to the United States and to be fair let's only use the 27 high-income OECD countries. (All the following data comes from The World Health Report 2000)Country | % of World | US/% of World------------------------------------------------- United States 4.52 1Japan 1.90 2.4Germany 1.22 3.7France 0.97 4.7United Kingdom 0.92 4.9Now let's sort by overall healthcare performanceCountry | Performance | Cost Per Capita----------------------------------------------- France 1 4Japan 10 13United Kingdom 18 26Germany 25 3United States 37 1Since you were interested in cost let's sort by Performance / Cost Per Capita. It's just a better metric.Country | P/C--------------------France 0.25United Kingdom 0.69Japan 0.76Germany 8.33United States 37.0And now let's scale this to the population. ((P/C)  (US/% of World)) and let's also reveal what system of healthcare each country uses.Country | (P/C)  (US/% of World) | System of Healthcare-------------------------------------------------------------------- France 0.6 Single-payerJapan 1.8 Single-payerUnited Kingdom 3.4 Single-payerGermany 30.8 Compulsory National InsuranceUnited States 37.0 Voluntary Private InsuranceSo as we can see single-payer is clearly more affordable and has better performance than either CNI or VPI systems of healthcare. And I have a hunch that if this sample had included even more countries that there would be a trend that Compulsory Private Insurance (like we have where I live in Mass.) would be better than VPI but still not as good as CNI.
2,"Do you actually consider France a great bastian of Health Care?????Yes, the cost is low...but remember the warm wave (they called it a heat wave, but it barely got over 30 C)...they had hundreds of people die. Why? They couldn't go see a doctor."
2,"Germany, France, UK, and Japan all are half the size of the US or smaller. That means you can't compare them because they are smaller thus healthcare is universal healthcare is cheaper."
1,"The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."
2," Public insurance would stifle medical innovation and advancement John Lechleiter. ""Health-Care Reform and the 'Innovation Test'"" Wall Street Journal. May 14, 2009: ""I've spent three decades working in or near biopharmaceutical research and development. During that time, I've witnessed breakthroughs as diverse as biosynthetic human insulin, bone-forming agents for treating osteoporosis, new cancer therapies, and a first-ever treatment for severe sepsis go from glimmers of intuition to everyday medical tools. [...] Inventions such as these -- and my list includes only the partial output of the company I work for -- have transformed the most basic expectations of human life in the last century. Today, the average life expectancy at birth in the U.S. is 78; when my mother was born in 1928 it was 57. (She's still in great health, by the way.) [...] Even in the last two decades of the 20th century, new medicines accounted for 40% of the increase in life expectancy in more than 50 countries, according to a recent study by Columbia University economist Frank Lichtenberg. In other words, for every year that life expectancy has increased, five months can be attributed to the availability of new medicines. [...] U.S.-based private industry is the heart and soul of this innovation drama, investing $58 billion in research and development for new medicines in 2007 alone. [...] it is vital to all of us that we insist that reform proposals pass the 'innovation test.' Providing insurance to millions of Americans through a government-run plan would fail the test. Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments. On the other hand, innovation would remain reasonably secure if universal access were achieved through tax credits and government subsidies that allow patients to choose from a variety of private health-financing options.""

1,"Man, it's the government's job to protect the people. Universal health care would be a godsend in our current state."
2,Show me in the Constitution where you will find the power for government to steal money from one person to give to another? I'd love to see it.
1,"So if you hate universal health care you must hate the idea of taxes then too right? But before you make a judgment, think about the people who've been dealt a bad hand, have a small house and debt up to their eyeballs. If that wasn't bad enough, now their kid just got his arm broken in seven places doing something stupid. They can't pay for the surgery, so they're screwed. Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right? Because everyone wants to get an education.Why shouldn't they get a medical security?"
2,"So what you are saying is that because there are a few hard luck cases out there, we should all be made to suffer under the same crappy health care system? I don't buy that. If you are so worried about these hard luck cases, why don't you give money to one of the thousands of legitimate charities that are oriented toward health care? Why are you so sure that the government can do a better job? Well I guess the government has a tremendous track record. I mean, just look at how they handled Katrina....ok...maybe that is a bad example. How about roads...no....another bad example. Well the government does a great job with schools....no....another bad example. Well the government does a great job of regulating financial instutions...no...another bad example. I've got it this time...the government does a great job of protecting us from contaminated food....oh...wait, there was that peanut butter scare, and the spinach scare and the tomato scare and the baby formula scare. Well surely the government keeps our streets safe...oh...no...wait, jails are full so they are letting criminals go. Well, we know this....the government does a great job of protecting our borders....gosh darn it, another bad example. Sorry boss, I couldn't find anything our government does well.

The problem wasn't the post Katrina response. Nothing could have been better. I saw it with my own eyes. BTW....did you notice you started out disagreeing with my principle and finished in total agreement? That's right, you agreed that the government is too inept to handle health care by way of admitting that the government can't handle schools, food safety or basic rescue operations."
1,"It is time for Universal health care for several reasons.1. It will grow the economy, by letting consumers and business keep more of their money that goes to pay health care premiums which amounts to a hidden tax.2. Americans shouldn't have to be forced to lose everything they worked their entire life for just because they got sick, and cannot afford to pay their hospital bill.3. Every other industrialized nation has it, which puts our business at a disadvantage.4. In the current system, those of us who have health care insurance end up paying for those who don't because hospitals pass the cost onto the insurance companies in higher costs to recover for those who don't pay. So it is already socialism.5. We spend more than any other country in the world on health care and yet we have 49 million Americans who aren't covered and we rank 33rd in the world in care. France spends about half of what we do and are ranked 1st.6. if it is done right it will be a system that offers Americans another choice in care, and provide competition for the private sector which should drive down the cost overall. More choice equals more freedom. And Freedom is what this country is all about baby!"
2,"1. It will do the opposite of growing the economy. When the government puts price controls on anything (which they have done in the past) you get several negative effects. The first is an artificial rise in demand. In the case of UHC, that means the government will have to ration care through means other than money. The second is you lose production when people that had made a profit off of the product leave because they can't earn a living any more. Finally, UHC would end health insurance. That means the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. Nearly doubling our current unemployment. 2. They aren't. Check my post on the opposite side of this page. 3. No it does not. It puts our businesses at an advantage. We just have to get away from this mentality that someone else should pay our bills.4. If you think that is socialism, than you are either being very disingenuous or you are incredibly ignorant. Do some reading on socialism. 5. Don't buy into those rankings. In France (and other countries) you only get health care if you are deemed worthy. The older you get, the less they will treat you. A 70 year old woman cannot get treatment for Cancer in France, but anyone can get treatment in the US. Does it cost more? Yes, but that has nothing to do with being socialized. It has to do with this mentality that someone else should pay our bills. 6. It can't be done right. The very idea is immoral."
1,Insurance companies are making healthcare an unaffordable luxury in america and it really needs to be stopped and or regulated so at the very least people that have insurance can receive the care they pay for. far to many people are being bankrupt by this current system
1," Public insurance option is less costly than private insurance ""Why The Public Health Insurance Option Is Worth Fighting For"". Think Progress. August 19th, 2009: ""Real health care reform that includes a new public health insurance option could adopt the kind of payment reforms that would start to “hold down long-term growth in health spending' and encourage providers to deliver care more efficiently. We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicare’s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years.""
"
2,"Insurance companies aren't doing that. Medicare/caid, schip and other government programs are driving up the cost of health care. Do you know what happens when you take cost down to a minimum? Demand goes up. If you have a segment of the population getting nearly free product (health care int his case) and the rest paying for the product....guess what happens? Those getting nearly free health care suck up as much of the product as they can and those of use paying for it are forced to pay premium prices for the artificially reduced supply."
1,"Being from Canada, I can tell you first hand the pros (and cons) of Public Health Care.I can tell you that because Health Care is free for everyone (this is a generalization, actual costs vary by province (or territory)), one, I break my arm and call an ambulance without a very strange bill appearing later. Two, the financial burden of Health Insurance is taken off the plates on the individual families, many of whom could not afford it. Instead Health Care is paid for through the province in which you reside. Should you want Private Health Care, it is available.I can also tell you that often Hospitals are backed up. Not enough staff is usually the case. Lots of the infrastructure (buildings, etc...) are getting older, and may not be being maintained effectively. This is a typical effect of placing, one, health care costs on a single party and, two, in the hands of elected officials. Often the budget doesn't allow for many of the things that are required by the Ministry of Health, or the politicans charged with making decision don't understand the pros and cons.All in all, I would not change the system, just amend it. Socialism (one of the governing philosophies in Canadian politics), allows for the freedom of the individual while taking care of the needs of the community. Any person in the Province of Ontario (for example) has the right to education, health care, etc... And the province provides these rights to the province. Education is free until Grade 12, and Health Care is almost always free."
1,"Universal Health Care is not an evil institution. I scanned over the opponent's arguments and saw things like, ""Universal Health Care is robbery"". Is cumpolsory public education also robbery? What about fire protection and police protection for all? There are some things to which all people are entitled, such as education and healthcare, and we live in a nation and time where that is possible. The private insurers have had ample opportunity to update their business model to actually care for all insured, but have chosen not to. They prioritize profits, denying payment for care whenever possible. They deny people admission into plans based on ""pre-existing conditions"" and the like. We need insurance that actually covers us and covers us all. Since private insurance companies apparently can't step up to the plate to fill this need, I see no issue with the government doing so."
1,"People who can't afford health care deserve it just as much as the people that do have it. Should someone with out it get hurt or injured, they won't be able to afford and be in debt for a long long time, and that is part of our economic problem. There are to many people in debt."
2,"Ok, so today's limitation on health care is affordability. Do you really want tomorrow's limitation...bureaucracy? Look at what is happening in GB. They are refusing care for breast cancer to women over a certain age because it isn't cost effective. How would you like to get that news? ""Well Mr. Birdman, you have cancer and it is curable, but you aren't worth enough to the government to cure."""
1,"Universal healthcare presents an opportunity for the health of all it's citizens. This, in my personal view is what a good government should really aim to do."
2,"Government is a zero sum game (in some respects). So, if the government gives people health care, what does the government have to take? For one, they take money. Much more money than private health care if they provide the same level of care. If they provide reduced care (see Canada, Australia, France, Great Britain...) then they can do it for less. The government will also take freedom. They won't allow you to get the treatment you need, rather you'll get the treatment they think you deserve based on some chart. They'll also take the freedom to eat as you wish (see NY and San Francisco). They may even require you to exercise x hours per day. The point is, there is a huge tradeoff if you allow the government to take over your health care. It is your health care, don't let a bureaucrat decide if you should or shouldn't have access to it."
2,"Everyone keeps trying to have these one quick fixes of the social inequalities that exist (and are increasing) for the American people. One big stimilus check does not save a bad business. It is a bad business. One switch from private to universal healthcare does not fix the problem: that people cannot afford it because they are poor. Universal healthcare could actually increase the cost of healthcare for some individuals, particularly the middle class. So switching the healthcare system does not solve the problem, it only changes it. What the American people need to focus on is something to alter the actual social condition--to mediate, to relieve, and to solve the growing poverty rates (and to make America as economically equal as it is idealistically equal). What could do this? Changing the healthcare system? Maybe. But maybe not."
1,"I wouldn't necessarily label changing over to Universal Health care a quick fix. In fact, switching over to Universal Health care could possibly be quite the process. We would change the nature of the system, which differs from your example of one large stimulus check. Rather, I would compare Massachusetts's mandated health insurance to your stimulus check, where the action taken is simply a bandage on the overall problem. The stimulus check doesn't help a business that just can't stay afloat, in the same way that mandated private health insurance doesn't help people who can't afford health insurance to begin with. Also, according to the Connecticut Coalition for Universal Health Care, ""The United States spends at least 40% more per capita on health care than any other industrialized country with universal health care."" I think that Universal Health care ""will alter the actual social condition--to mediate, to relieve, and to solve the growing poverty rates (and to make America as economically equal as it is idealistically equal)"". Plus, I think we'll all be a lot healthier and more healthy people equals more people who can go to work and contribute to the overall economy."
2,"How is it not a quick fix? For starters, one of the main problems with health care in America is its lack of doctors and its price at doctor fees. America has more malpractice suits than any other country, which means that our doctors need to be heavily insured. The more our doctors need to spend, the more we need to spend. The problem with American healthcare system is not who is paying for it (private insurance agencies, or the government) because in the end the people paying for it are, well, the people. The real problem is becoming a loss in education (check out how the education cuts schools are taking. I know at Framingham State College they are about to cut the English Department by nearly two thirds). Less education means less high paying jobs. Less high paying jobs includes doctors. Universal Healthcare will not work unless America gets more doctors (if everyone has coverage, everyone is going to go--especially in situation where before they had decided not to: this means that some people may expect a doctor to treat their every cold, their every cut, and their every bruise. There will be those who abuse the system) and America cannot get more doctors unless it aids students in becoming doctors (and then protects its doctors from oftentimes ill-advised lawsuits). Again, I will repeat my main point. A Universal Healthcare system will not aid this country's economic situation. It will not help the people. It will hurt them. The middle class will bear more weight (and taxation) upon their shoulders. The middle class now is already paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants. I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?). Universal healthcare is not a band-aid, so why should it be treated as such? It is just a change of structure, not a change to fix the economic and social crises of the nation."
1," Public insurance delivers same quality insurance at a lower price Jacob Hacker. ""The case for public plan"". The Institute for America's Future: ""COST-CONTROL ADVANTAGES OF PUBLIC INSURANCE. It is often assumed that private health plans are much more efficient than public health insurance. Yet a range of studies demonstrate that public insurance is able to provide a given level of benefits for less than they would cost through private insurance. Lower administrative costs and the ability to bargain for lower service and drug prices chiefly explain this advantage, as does the obvious lack of a profit margin in public programs. These features of public insurance not only allow it to offer the same coverage for less than private plans. They also, the evidence suggests, allow it to better restrain the increase in costs over time while preserving inclusive coverage.""
"
1,"Since you bring up the doctors, I found a group called Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP). You can visit their website: http://www.pnhp.org/.They claim, ""Currently, the U.S. health care system is outrageously expensive, yet inadequate. Despite spending more than twice as much as the rest of the industrialized nations ($7,129 per capita), the United States performs poorly in comparison on major health indicators such as life expectancy, infant mortality and immunization rates. Moreover, the other advanced nations provide comprehensive coverage to their entire populations, while the U.S. leaves 47 million completely uninsured and millions more inadequately covered.""When it comes to the actual cost of insurance, they argue that, ""The reason we spend more and get less than the rest of the world is because we have a patchwork system of for-profit payers. Private insurers necessarily waste health dollars on things that have nothing to do with care: overhead, underwriting, billing, sales and marketing departments as well as huge profits and exorbitant executive pay. Doctors and hospitals must maintain costly administrative staffs to deal with the bureaucracy. Combined, this needless administration consumes one-third (31 percent) of Americans’ health dollars.""These doctors believe that, ""Single-payer financing is the only way to recapture this wasted money. The potential savings on paperwork, more than $350 billion per year, are enough to provide comprehensive coverage to everyone without paying any more than we already do.Under a single-payer system, all Americans would be covered for all medically necessary services, including: doctor, hospital, long-term care, mental health, dental, vision, prescription drug and medical supply costs. Patients would regain free choice of doctor and hospital, and doctors would regain autonomy over patient care.Physicians would be paid fee-for-service according to a negotiated formulary or receive salary from a hospital or nonprofit HMO / group practice. Hospitals would receive a global budget for operating expenses. Health facilities and expensive equipment purchases would be managed by regional health planning boards.A single-payer system would be financed by eliminating private insurers and recapturing their administrative waste. Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business. Costs would be controlled through negotiated fees, global budgeting and bulk purchasing.""I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed."
2,"Nothing in my argument remotely construes universal healthcare is the cause of the expense of healthcare in the U.S.; however, as an aside argument, I think there is a connection that has yet to be made that the socialist healthcare systems of other countries are at least in part responsible for the costs of healthcare in the U.S.. Merck pharmaceutical sells its drugs to both private and public healthcare systems. Merck will be compensated for losses incurred by sales to public systems by passing the loss to private systems in the form of higher prices. So in a sense it is plausible that the public healthcare systems of the world actually exacerbate higher prices where healthcare is privately owned. Now back to our original subject. #1. What is the primary problem with the healthcare system of the U.S.? My answer: Ninety plus percent of the patients of the system cannot afford to pay the price of their own healthcare.#2. What is the root cause of the patient’s inability to pay for healthcare? Is it A, healthcare is too expensive or B, that their wages are too low, or C other.My answer: B, their wages are too low.(My father, earning the wage of a garage mechanic, paid cash for the births of all of his children with less than four weekly paychecks each. Today, how many mechanics are paid 14,000 dollars a month, which is the average cost of an uncomplicated vaginal birth? )HEY! I am no longer going to continue debating or justifying my argument concerning U.H.Either people understand or don’t understand what robbery looks like. I am not their god or their moral judge.Screw the logical formality of debating this absurd question!• Universal Healthcare is a crime against the working class. • The question of this entire debate is nothing more than a question about the benefit of outright criminality.Indulge my short or not so short rant for a moment, if you will. I am extremely disturbed that in the hearts and minds of the U.S. populace, people abound in ignorance of the fact they advocate robbery when they push for public healthcare. They are implicating themselves as criminals and seek to justify their criminality by legislative action of the government. We are truly a nation of thieves. We, as a nation, are so mad upon our right to healthcare we want to violate the right of ownership of property, including the wages of all persons in the U.S. It’s as though there is no other alternative but to steal from one another, our children, parents, and friends. And the justification for all of it is that all is right because everyone will be doing it. (Bare in mind that they who argue the most for public healthcare have the most to gain by it. There will be 80 million baby boomers entering retirement in the next eighteen years. Should we suppose they want someone else to pay for their healthcare so that they can take cruises around the world? (Have you seen the bumper sticker on the $300.000 RVs that read: “I am spending my children’s inheritance)Moreover how many of those baby boomers want people such as myself and our families to pay for their healthcare needs for the next eighteen plus years? This is too much like social security with perks! )Know this; we will have in the U.S. within a very short time frame a public healthcare system. And how do I know this? The baby boom generation of 80+million rules the country today and before too many of them have retired they will make certain that their children are bound by taxation for the healthcare needs of the baby boom gen. And so in conclusion, regardless of what is thought or not thought of public healthcare we working class stiffs will be paying in the form of taxation all healthcare needs of the most debauched, rotten, spoiled generation ever born in the U.S. The baby boomers are currently socializing the losses of the most cherished institutions of the U.S.; expect the healthcare system over the coming weeks and months of this year to also need taxpayer money. Yes, I’ve made a judgment of the baby boom gen. I know what to expect from that gen. and I am in no mood to prove they intend to rob from me and mine. The baby boom gen. fixes its problems by acts of governmental crimes against the innocent."
1,"Although I do agree the Cost of the system and wages for the average citizen are the problems, I have to disagree with how to fix them.With many of the problems of our time, they come from either extremely lax regulation or no regulation at all. This is an extremely sad statement on human nature.The another (unmentioned) part of Socialism is that society helps you when your in need. Sure the Baby Boomers are going to be literally siphoning money out of the US tax payer, I know they are in Canada. But what happens when you reach that age? Are you going to be able to pay medical costs? Are you going to enjoy paying medical costs?It's a tit-for-tat situation. Sure your covering the costs of others now, but someday others may be covering your costs. And I'm pretty sure, unless your secretly Bill Gates, you, nor your family, have an infinite money source."
2,"One, government (especially in a country like ours) sucks at taking care of the people. Do you really want the Doctor's office to be like the DMV? Do you want to be FORCED to get something done just cause the government papers says you should. Hmm, you're gonna have to get a prescription for this because you have this. yes, the side effects suck, but if you get too sick we'll have to pay a lot more. Deal with it.Not only will it be ineffective, it'll be taking away our rights as a whole. We already have medicaid for the poor, do we really have to create Universal Health Care when the numbers don't even add up?"
1,"On a personal note, I'd trust the government to take care of me more than a private insurance company. Also, the most I've ever waited at the DMV is an hour. I had to wait months and months in order to see a specialist my doctor referred me to (of course, one my insurance would cover), and then when I finally got to see the specialist, he had so many appointments that he only saw me for about 5 minutes. I think Universal Health care would be better for everyone, for the reasons I've already outlined. I'm not focusing solely on the poor. What numbers are you referencing?"
2,"I think that universal healthcare sounds all warm and fuzzy and lets treat everyone equal and whatever, but seriously lets think about it for a minute. I can empathize with you on the specialist thing. I had to see a retinal specialist last year once a month for 6 months. The receptionist warned us not to bother coming early bc there would be a wait. The wait every month no fail was AT LEAST 3 hours even with an appointment scheduled. Now that was a retinal specialist. Think about how many poor people are plagued with diabetes and are suffering retinal damage because 1. they cannot or/ do not want to care for their diabetes or 2. are not able to get medical attention. If all those people were suddenly blessed with universal health care that wait would be off the friggin chart. And thats just for diabetic retinopathy. Now imagine cardiovascular disease, resiratory and, mental diseases; all of these diseases are more prevalent in low income populations aka those that are most likely to not have health care coverage. Where are we going to get the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, cardiologists, rheumatologists, CNA's, PCA's, and the like, not to mention room in the wards and equipment to care for there patients? I have been in the hospitals for more than 2 years now and even with that little experience I can say that hospitals, although touted as near rackets by most, are strapped for staff and properly functioning equipment. An average nursing assignment is determined by most facilities to be at 4-5 to ensure safe care for all patients. In reality nurses are assigned upwards of 6. In nursing homes and rehab settings it can be upwards of 16 (where I work). The most I have seen is 22. This means less care for ALL of the patients involved not just the poor, and is frankly dangerous to everyone involved.As a health care provider it breaks my heart to see people suffering for financial or lack of insurance or whatever, but handing it to everyone in a country this size with a medical field as lacking as ours is is totally unrealistic. First fix the health care system as a whole THEN invite everyone. I also advocate for plans like MassHealth. So many people knock it but my family was on it for 1 year and it was not bad. I forget the statistic but there is a huge percent of people who are elligible for it that do not utilize it."
1,"Where are we going to get the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, cardiologists, rheumatologists, CNA's, PCA's, and the like, not to mention room in the wards and equipment to care for there patients?Under my plan, we pattern a Universal Health Care, system after our Military. Our Military is socialism on a grand scale, and we have the Best Trained, Best Equipped Military in the World. So I used the same model in to model my Health Care Plan around.We recruit kids out of high school, that have good grades and a interest in the medical field, but because of financial reasons cannot afford to go to College. We get them to enlist in the Medical Corps, where we promise to pay for their entire Medical education, in exchange for a agreement of practicing in a Government Hospital somewhere in the United States for 10 years. At the end of the 10 years, they can either re-enlist or they can choose to go into private practice.Doctors and Nurses would be paid a competive salery but not as much as they possibly could be making in private paractice. However under the Government they do not have administrative costs, or Office exspenses, and no malpractice insurance premiums to worry about.The chances for malpractice would be reduced, do to the fact a person could get up to five different opinions if they were not comfortable with the original diagnosis. While this won't rule out malpractice 100% there will always be the doctor who makes a mistake. In which case the case would be reviewed and if found the Doctor was grossly negligent, would have his license to practice pulled.Most lawsuits today seek money to pay for future care of the patient, however that wouldn't be necessary, because you already have free medical.We could employ 500,000 doctors at a cost of 100 billion dollars wich would give us a Patient to Doctor Ratio of 600 to 1. Thats what are current ratio is. But the problem is there are communities who do not have any doctors, so they have to travel a great distance for care. This problem would be solved also under my plan.We buy up older hospitals to keep the cost down. We Do have strategically placed Expensive Diagnostic equipment within a 4 hours drive of any location. So it is possible that a person would have to drive up to 250 miles to get a MRI, but they would be able to deduct the cost of the trip on their taxes, excluding lodging. Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so. We currently will be paying $550 -$600 billion in interest on the debt next year. So if we can pay off the debt, which I can do in 7 years, and return this country to a lender nation, this country could afford to Universal Health care better than what France has, and I could still cut everyones taxes by $3800.00.Part of it would be paid for by interest money we would be collecting from other countries, once we became a lender nation again. By loaning Money to developing 3rd world countries we spread our influence over these countries by helping them develope, instead of China or Russia. The intrest we collect on the loans helps pay for our health care.This would lower medical costs, let consumers keep the money they currently pay out for insurance premiums and deductables, and reduce the cost for business who currently pay the lions share of a employees health care insurance. This should add another 3-4% onto our economic growth a year.Along with my trade reforms we could have 10% economic growth year over year. But remember we are fighting a entrenched insurance lobby, who will fight this type of plan tooth and nail. Not to mention business might even fight it because it would we would have economic freedom if we were to have 10% growth year over year in this country. They do not want workers who are empowered. They want workers wholive in fear of losing their jobs everyday.But it can be done, and I can pay for it without raising taxes."
2,"The Case Against Universal Health CareWhy UHC is WrongUniversal Health Care is unconstitutional. As with many of the social programs that we allow to continue in violation of the Constitution; the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the government have no authority to redistribute wealth regardless of the purpose. Most people believe that the Constitution does in fact give the government the right to impose social programs. They derive this belief from two separate, but similar clauses. The first comes from the Preamble which says; “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” It is the phrase “promote the general welfare” that people often quote as the power to create social programs. In actuality, the Preamble does not give any branch the authority to do anything. The reality is, the Preamble is a guideline for the three branches. You could translate the Preamble to like this:More perfect Union = Better than EnglandEstablish Justice = Establish JusticeInsure domestic Tranquility = Peaceful Provide for the common defence = one army to defend (i.e. not controlling)Promote the general Welfare = all laws/regulations should not harm the countrySecure the Blessing of Liberty = Freedom for AllIf the government followed those guidelines for every law/regulation they form, they will be on their way to being Constitutional. However, the federal government must use Article 1, Section 8 to derive their powers. In fact, Article 1, Section 8 is where we find the second common misconception. This is where each power is enumerated to the Congress. The first clause states: “The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;”. We see here that a large part of the Preamble is restated but with a few notable differences. The most notable and important difference is to whom the congress can apply these powers. Pay close attention to the phrase “of the United States.” Throughout the Constitution the founders use very specific terms to mean very specific things. When they wanted rights or rules applied to citizens they used the term citizens. When they wanted rights or rules to apply to anyone they used “the people.” When they wanted rights or rules to apply to States, they used the term States. When they used the term “the United States” they were talking about the federal government. If you replace the term “of the United States” with its literal meaning you get a more clear understanding of its true meaning: “The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the Federal Government…”Just so there is no confusion, you will find in the 10th Amendment that these powers are limited to Article 1, Section 8 by stating: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” In other words: ‘if it ain’t in the Constitution, you can’t do it.’Why it doesn’t workEverywhere Universal Health Care has been tried, it has failed. UHC always becomes expensive, restrictive and lacks innovation. We’ve been told that UHC is cheap. Well, that isn’t the case. UHC is as expensive as the government lets it be. We only have to look here in our own country to see evidence of that. Medicare sets limits to what a doctor can charge for a visit or procedure. Every doctor charges the limit set by Medicare. They have to. If they don’t, Medicare will assume that they have set the bar to high and lower it. Apply this to the entire health care system. If we expand that policy to cover every doctor and every procedure we will have several negative results. The first is the loss of talented doctors. People that become doctors don’t just do it for the gratification of saving lives. The fact is, they lose every patient sooner or later. Doctors do what they do for the money, especially the good ones. If you take away their ability to demand a fair market price you take away the incentive to be a doctor and we lose good doctors. Another problem we will encounter is a short coming in available services. We can see this in other countries. Many countries with socialized medicine require patients to wait months or years to see a doctor. In some parts of Canada, the wait to see a doctor for a routine exam is two years. This problem is compounded by the lack of monetary incentive to be a doctor. Finally, because the government sets the prices, inventors and manufacturers of medical equipment will just fade away. Price controls never work. Further, innovative people will always find a free market where they can excel. Why we don’t need itMost people have this idea that if they don’t have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die. That is not the case. Most people just need a type of insurance that is usually referred to as Catastrophic or Major Medical Insurance. Major Medical covers some very basic health issues. A good generalized definition is “everything that is life threatening or life altering.” In practical terms, that means if you have an expensive problem, you are covered. So you can go to the ER or hospital and pay only the deductible (or deductible plus a percentage depending on the plan). Major Medical plans can also be purchased with a prescription drug rider that will cover most prescriptions you will need. The health insurance we have all been told we have to have is called Comprehensive (or Premium) Insurance. Comprehensive Insurance covers everything Major Medical covers but also ads routine visits to the doctor. In fact, we all purchase Major Medical Insurance with the Comprehensive Clause added to it. This means that the coverage for ER and hospital stays is identical. The only difference being what you pay for a doctor. I got quotes from eHealthInsurance.com. I put in a family of four with both parents 30 years old non-smokers and 10 and 5 year old children. One quote was from Humana (Major Medical) and the other from Cigna (comprehensive). The Humana quote was for $196.04 per month, coming out to $2,352.48 per year. The other was from Cigna (comprehensive) and was very affordably priced at $292.00 per month or $3,504 per year. For a typical year, the family of four would probably have six visits to the doctor. Most doctors charge around $150 for a visit. If the family is on the Humana plan, they will pay $900 out of pocket because they pay for the whole thing. If they are on the Cigna plan, they will pay a $30 deductible per visit plus 20% which comes to $324. When you figure in the added premium, they don’t save money. There is one big difference though, if someone goes to the hospital and uses more than $10,000 the Humana plan becomes much better. After $10,000 the Humana plan covers 100% of the cost, where as the Cigna plan covers 80%. This gives the person on the plan that we’ve all been told is not good enough a huge cost savings. What needs to be doneI’m not one to dismiss an idea if I don’t have a better idea of my own. My plan incorporates promoting Major Medical Insurance in conjunction with Health Savings Accounts. Health Savings Accounts are just as they sound, savings accounts specifically for health care. The government allows us (gee, isn’t that nice of them) to put money into a savings account, before income tax is removed, and use it for health care. The catch is, at the end of the year anything that is left in the account becomes property of the government. My solution is to allow HSAs to roll over from year to year untaxed (unless used for purposes other than health care) and after an individual reaches retirement age the account can be used for any purpose. This will have numerous advantages from free market pressure on visits to the doctor to increased savings rates for the average citizen. We all know how the free market works and despite what some say, it works very well. When people have control over their money, they use it wisely. It is a precious commodity and they won’t hand over more of it than they have to. Even today, some health care centers are bowing to the pressure of the free market. Urgent care centers (doc in the box as my wife likes to call them) allow uninsured people to visit the doctor for as little as $75. As a patron of our local doc in the box, I can say that the care in these centers is fantastic. Part of the reason the down turn in 2008 and 2009 has been so severe is the negative savings rate that plagues the nation. With an incentive to save money before it is taxed, people will be more inclined to put their money aside for rainy days than use it to make monthly payments on maxed out credit cards that bought a house full of useless crap. In addition, I’d allow them to put their excess HSA savings in bonds and cds so that they earn a small amount of interest with virtually no chance of loss. If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they don’t have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest).

They then either spend years struggling trying to pay it off or they just can't pay it and it ruins their credit etc. For example, to pay insurance by yourself costs around $300 a month. Now that's for one person. The reason no one is rolling over dead is because most higher level jobs include insurance and they cover a little more than half of that cost. Let's say you don't have the best job and aren't getting insurance. Add in rent, food, transportation, bills, etc....How long do you think it would take you to pay a surgery if this were to happen? How would you ever get ahead? I struggled with underprivileged students for over a year and this was something I would hear. It would always baffle me as to how they couldn't get out of the situation but it really is cyclical. It's very said. I would speak with teens and over 50% already had kids at 17 and 18.

1,YOUR HEAD A SPLODE
1,Universal health care doesn't have to mean giving up the benefits of capitalism. We can have both public and private health care operating at the same time.
2,"The thing about universal health care, is that it's definitely not free. The money for it has to come from somewhere, and that of course is from taxes... and as Government involvement in the health care industry has only made things worse overall and not better, I don't see how it's possible that 1) giving them even more power will make anything better, and 2) that it's justified to implement this policy at the expense of both the sick and the healthy. If someone chooses to eat sugar-frosted sugar lumps for breakfast and drink bladder-busting bottles of cola, every day until they get severe diabetes, why should everyone else have to pay for their treatment? Takes away an incentive to choose a healthy lifestyle. The system as it stands now is no good at all, largely because of Government involvement. It seems to me that the Insurance/Pharmaceutical industries have penetrated Congress with their lobbyists to such an extent as to get regulatory laws passed that stifle fair competition, giving them the advantage of a cartel. They don't need to lower prices like they would in a true free market, thanks to Uncle Sam's help... that's the system we should be fighting against, not trusting those who caused the problem to have universal control over 'fixing' it."

2,"Individual health care is better for all involved:First why individual is better:--Free market system allows for innovation on the part of the healthcare industries, creating new and better, and more than likely cheaper, medicines and procedures. A socialized system will put a cease to competition, and will thus end almost all source of motivation for innovation.--Allows for more areas of the economy for the government to have tax income from.Now, why socialized is worse:--Very high tax hikes, the government needs to pay for the health care of an entire nation, which will inevitably come from tax payers pockets. Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets. Since all of this will be paid for in taxes, which will be spread out evenly throughout the social classes, thus each person will, on average, be paying just as much, if not more, for health care. Since everyone will be using different amounts of this health care, some people will be paying for more than they are using, and others using more than what they are paying for. This goes against every tenet of a free market system.--Will inevitably reduce the quality of the doctors, procedures, and medicines. Since all governments want to have the lowest budget possible. Any government will look to the cheapest options, which will most likely be the lowest in quality. --Further more, the amount of bureaucracy necessary to regulate and record these new industries will be incredible, adding to the tax increase, but also creating a waiting period for people who need all sorts of medicines and procedures.As you can see a free market, individual, health care is the better system for all involved."
2,"Universal health care has a lot of issues. I live in Canada and I know these issues. Pill pushing doctors that don't work hard, a lot of administrative work that push up costs on governments, long lines and extremely long wait times for surgeries and specialty medical attention. I read the first post, that people should be equally entitled for good affordable health care. The fact is that a free market, capitalist, profit driven health care system ends up costing less per person and offers a higher quality of service. Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years. There are 30 million people in Canada and this is the reason why Canada is not as prosperous as other capitalist countries. High taxes create less jobs and innovations. In Canada we pay more taxes than California but we have the same GDP/GSP and same population. Canada actually pays 40% more taxes."

2,"I ask, where does this ""right"" derive from? If health care is a right, why not food, or housing too? I mean, if a right is something that the Government grants us, then what stops them from revoking that right when they don't feel like granting it any longer? For example, even the Soviet Union had a Constitution, wherein the Government granted its citizens, for the betterment of the Socialist state, the freedoms of speech, press, assembly and protest. However if their Government felt your speech, etc. wasn't ""for the betterment of the Socialist state"", then those rights didn't apply to you. The United States Constitution credits rights as being ""endowed by our Creator"", such that no argument can be openly made that the Government can revoke them. To re-define the meaning of what a right is, just because we think it'll help give us something that we want, puts us in a dangerous position where we'll be at the Government's mercy to grant those rights. The Government doesn't own us, so therefore it shouldn't have to take care of us like our mother did."

Where is the justice in the healthcare industry? You have pharma companies charging an arm and a leg for products that aren't worth the price.

Sick and injured people are less productive.2) When you have multiple competing insurance companies, each company has to repeat the same work. Each company needs it's own secretaries, computer people, lawyers, etc. These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States. Thus universal health care would actually mean less government spending and lower taxes. (source)"

1, Health care should be free to all upon entry like the NHSin UK. The only problem is that the private sector take away the resources and drug companies rip off the government.
1, Yes after an initial payment of lets say a pound or two per visit.
1, Yes yes yes
1, People who pay taxes should.
1," Health care should be free. Doctors and nurses shouldn't work for free, the government should pay them, we should not have to. Health insurance is so expensive. For a family in the workplace it costs about 1/4 of each of your checks to insure them. Plus, there are copays for the doctor and prescription. Many people go without and end up very sick because they aren't taking care of themselves properly. On top of that, children aren't getting the coverage they need. Lots of workplaces don't offer dental, so therefore cavities are not getting filled and kids teeth are rotting. We would altogether be more healthy if the government would pick up the tab."
1, I think healthcare should be free. People talk about how taxes would be higher well taxes are killing people too so at least if they were somewhere they could not worry about having to deal with one more thing perhaps the US would be a little better. A doctor or health care person should not go to school to make sure he makes a lot of money but if it is their will to be a doctor then be the doctor for the very reason of helping a sick person.
1," Health is the biggest asset a person can have in life. Unless we get a good health we lack the efficiency to work properly. Thus it is required to have a proper health free from diseases. Health care issues are very much important in an economy and the Government should play a major role in that. Diseases and health problems do not come by knocking us and thus any one can be affected with any kind of disease, may it be big or small. Government though maintains its hospitals and tries to give proper medication but at times that does not remain to be sufficient enough in terms of the cost factor. Government should make healthcare absolutely free so that no patient dies out of financial problems. It is a basic requirement in any society and in any economy."
1," When it come to how much money we spend of all things health care should be free!! People below the poverty line should also have the same rights as the 'higher class'. I say this because the people in the poverty line can not afford health care. So they get sick. And in turns get more sick because they don't get any help! The number of uninsured citizens has grown to over 40 million.   /> Health care has become increasingly unaffordable for businesses and individuals.   /> We can eliminate wasteful inefficiencies such as duplicate paper work, claim approval, insurance submission, etc.   /> We can develop a centralized national database which makes diagnosis and treatment easier for doctors.   /> Medical professionals can concentrate on healing the patient rather than on insurance procedures, malpractice liability, etc.   /> Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light; currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs"
1,"Public insurance protects uninsured from economic calamity. 2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: ""A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.""[8] Indeed, health care is a leading cause of bankruptcy, which severely damages an individuals ability to engage productively in the economy. A public plan will nearly eliminate bankruptcies resulting from being uninsured, subsequently freeing individuals to productively add value in the economy.
"
1," Healthcare should not be free.  If you can't afford healthcare, that's tough, then you should get a job that means you can afford it. Well, what about the poor, the unemployed I hear you whine, well they should get a job, shouldn't they, then they can get health care too.  />   /> Free health care drives down standards and drains the government's resources and therefore the country's resources.  What about old people? Well, if they had paid into a private health care scheme all their lives, then they should be allowed health care when they retire.  I don't understand why we don't have affordable life long health care schemes as standard.  />   /> Where would you rather be treated? Quickly by expert doctors who are paid really well and don't work all the hours that God sends, or would you prefer to be left on a trolley in a corridor for hours waiting until someone remembers where you are and comes to see if you haven't died yet.  />   /> Private health care means REAL care.  It means short waiting times for essential treatment and it mean being made to feel cared for when you are there.  Why should people expect something for nothing.  Well what about National Insurance? Surely you pay that.  Yes, that's your pension and your health care all in one.  But the pittance that most people pay is ridiculously low.  If employers offered health care as a benefit, people would really care about keeping their jobs and we wouldn't have a nation of  disaffected people, working in miles and miles of factory-call centres across the globe.  />   /> No, I do not agree, I do not think that health care should be free, I think we should pay for it, to require a high standard and we can get treatment when we need it, not when someone can be squeezed into an already bursting schedule to be seen by tired doctors who are looking forward to private practice and six figure salaries at some point in the future as a GP."
2, Not all health care should be free . Because their are rich people and they should pay to give money to the doctors.
2," Free health care isn't ""free"".  No you don't have to pay when you go to the doctor's office but somebody does.  If doctor's worked for free eventually there would be no doctors, especially with the drastic inflation.  So technically the government would be paying for it and the money that pays for it is taken out of taxes.  Basically everyone is paying for everyone else.  Why would you want to have your money taken out if you very rarely need to go to the doctor and have it pay for someone who goes to the doctor every time they sneeze?    />     Free healthcare is the beginning of communism and communism doesn't work.  You people who believe healthcare should be free are fooling yourselves.  Nothing is free except the air you breath.  The money to pay the doctors for their services must come from somewhere, otherwise the doctors couldn't support themselves.  They would be working at a loss to help you but what would you be doing to help them?    />    Rather than having ""free"" healthcare I believe doctors should be restricted on their fees.  They shouldn't be allowed to charge $200 (give or take) for them to come in and say ""I don't know what's wrong."""
2," ""It's worth what you pay for it"" - hick proverb.  Somehow people get the idea that we can have quality health care without paying doctors or that it's cheaper to pay for it with taxes than to pay for specific visits.  If we were to tax everybody and give health care to people who were not paying taxes (poor people) we would be robbing healthy people and throwing their money away on people who don't benefit society."
2, In an ideal world maybe. People's wages needed paying.
2," There is no such thing as ""free health care"". Somehow, we will have to pay for it by our taxes or insurance. The poor should get it free, though."
2," Nothing is free.  What you really mean is that you think that the government should take more taxes from us to pay for healthcare.  This is a ridiculous idea.  I shouldn't have to pay for other people's health expenses, especially when I get sick very rarely.  You are advocating socialism.  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  All this will cause is a slow up in medical care.  When we don't have socialized healthcare, doctors know that they will get paid more by being a better doctor, because there services will be more highly demanded.  In socialized medicine, all doctors know that they will be getting paid so much no matter how well a job they do, as long as they do a good enough job not to get fired.  People will die if from minor health problems if we socialize medicine."
2," Not all healthcare should be free. First of all, its not a practical idea. The costs of doctor's consultation, medical tests, operations, equipments, hospitals, utilities will be in billions of dollars. Government could go bankrupt. I personally think that it should be cheap rather than freely available. In your case, people will be putting responsibilities of their health on doctors and medicines, rather than taking care personally by refraining from alcohol, smoking, and other harmful substances. Nothing should be free!"
1," Health care, if possible, should be available to all, and is a more important right than education."
1, Health care. I am in a private health care scheme through my employer. And I jumped at it. The NHS produces doctors who will see you quicker if you are registered to BUPA. The same doctors.  /> I once saw doctors as the last hope of idealism. Realism won that one again.  /> 
2," Expensive public insurance option would worsen national debt Karl Rove. ""How to Stop Socialized Health Care"" Wall Street Journal. June 11, 2009: ""the public option is far too expensive. The cost of Medicare -- the purest form of a government-run 'public choice' for seniors -- will start exceeding its payroll-tax 'trust fund' in 2017. The Obama administration estimates its health reforms will cost as much as $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. It is no coincidence the Obama budget nearly triples the national debt over that same period. [...] Medicare and Medicaid cost much more than estimated when they were adopted. One reason is there's no competition for these government-run insurance programs. In the same way, Americans can expect a public option to cost far more than the Obama administration's rosy estimates.""

1," Absolutely! It's an embarassment that the richest country in the world, and supposedly the most Christian as well, permits millions of its citizens to suffer without access to good healthcare. Our infant fatality rate, life expectancy, and other health statistics bear out the failures of our present system."
1," What is call The N.H.S. Is a million miles away from what it once was when introduced to Britain in the 1950's.  /> We can no longer afford in it's present form, and do all the other things Governments commit us to."

1," In Canada, It Is! :D"

1," Too darn  expensive to be free at point of delivery. What are ""world class Standards"" would fall, and people who had money would have the best treatment."
2," Health care is not a right.  It is already largely controlled by government influences, and has been for a couple of decades.  Many of the problems are the result of government intrusion into healthcare.  More government intrusion will lead to further problems; there is no reason it would be better.  Besides, the majority of folks don't want the major changes Obama and Congress are promoting.  Is this a Democracy or what?"
2, No. Obamas health care plan is dumb to say the least. We borrowed 7 billion dollars for what? To try to fix the economy? Has it worked yet? NO! It hasnt! Obama is full of ideas but he has no idea how to execute. Health care will put the economy in even more of a crisis. When willl americans learn. Obama is a mad man if he thinks he can pull this health care system out of his anus and make it work. We are in more and more debt everyday. Why make it worse and worse?
2, He doesn't have one congress does and they are busily reducing it to a mess as congress generally does.
2," Although I fully back the concept of universal health coverage and I do acknowledge something has to be done to fix the current structure in light of demographic changes, I'm AGAINST his plan because I do not believe we can afford this right now.  We just borrowed gargantuan levels of money just to stop the economy from collapsing (and it's still not clear whether it worked yet), plus we're still in two wars, we simply cannot afford another huge price tag right now.  You don't borrow to buy a house well beyond your current financial means and then immediately turn around and borrow to buy a second house too."
2,"Costs of public insurance will grow as it pushes out private insurance. The American Medical Association argued in June of 2009 letter to the Senate Finance Committee: ""If private insurers are pushed out of the market, the group said, 'the corresponding surge in public plan participation would likely lead to an explosion of costs that would need to be absorbed by taxpayers.'""[9]
"
2," It is not my obligation to pay for the healthcare of others. As a Christian, I am all for charity and think the church needs to step up to that far better than it has done so, but forced payment on my part removes that possibility. Not to mention, government programs are always a mess and our constitution is designed to limit governmental power for that reason."
2, He doesn't have a health care plan. I would probably be for it if he did.
1," I agree with you in principle.  In reality, however, doctors do need to get paid, equipment and supplies cost money, and the few nations who experimented with socialized medicine have had a mix of results.  I just don't see free for all health care happening anytime soon.  />   /> On a side note, if we consider medical care a free for all right then shouldn't food and housing also be free for all rights?  It doesn't do you any good to get your broken arm set if you're about to starve or freeze to death."
2," There is no such thing as ""free"" healthcare.  Someone will have to pay for it.  If you mean, somebody else should pay for my healthcare because I can't or don't want to, then that's a different debate.  Certainly, healthcare isn't an equal right if some are paying for themselves and others, and others are contributing nothing."

And people get served by GOOD doctors, not quacks working for an HMO (which don't exist under universal health care).  You need chemo...you aren't going to be refused.  />   /> Insurance works different for health care here as well.  The biggest point being...THEY DON'T SAY NO.  They CAN'T say no.  The doctor gets paid through the ministry of health either directly or via insurance companies (like work benefits).  It's not corrupt because the Government is the middleman ensuring compliance of the insurance companies.  />   /> The Doctors are well-paid, well-educated and generally fantastic.    />   /> Americans have just been brow-beaten to the point they think they are COMSUMERS of health care.  The only aspects of anything medical that would make them consumers is BOTOX, cosmetic surgery, and the like.  />   /> Hell, even Viagra is covered under most peoples drug plan."

2,"Public insurance will be used excessively at greater cost. Walton J. Francis. ""Why a new public plan will not improve American health care"". Heritage Foundation. May 5, 2009: ""Excess Use. Then there is the matter of managing patient care to improve outcomes and reduce costs. Medicare spends zero on this function.[31] Private plans spend around 5 percent in administrative costs to manage care (second surgical opinions, pre-certification for hospital stays, and the review of preferred provider outcomes, etc.) and often save around 10 percent in reduced use of health care ser vices. Medicare's administrative costs look better arithmetically because the denominator is higher and the numerator is lower, but the advantage is again entirely illusory—$100 in frugal care costs the private plan $16 (the previous $11 plus $5), while Medicare is spending $120 and wasting $20—$10 on fraud and $10 on overuse in addition to the $5 it spends on bill paying. Again, the worse the actual performance, the better Medicare's administrative costs appear as a percentage of total spending.""
"
2," I am generally for private market healthcare.  Private enterprise is better at supplying goods and services than ""government business.""  There is no doubt there are great problems with our healthcare system, but it is hardly representative of the free market.  Free market went away along time ago when the government initially got in the game of directing huge monies and regulation into the system.    /> I think the most sensible approach would be to go backwards a bit and better analyze the ""whys"" we ended up with some of the problems we currently have.  I know many of the whys are indeed due to government causation.  The problem with this approach is that the government will never do it.  It would be self incrimination.  So, we will probably end up with universal healthcare and twenty years from now we will all lament, what happened to the good old days of great healthcare like there was in 2009."
2," I did a study in my social sciences. Apparently people with more money are happier and people with less money aren't happy and die much younger. And all the Sociologists are saying, ""spread the wealth."" They can get out of my face because we have the best health care, not the most flexible. We already charge too much for certain procedures and tools.

Such two-tier health care systems already exist in countries with national health care schemes such as the United Kingdom and Germany. In the United Kingdom, more and more Britons are opting for private health insurance instead of remaining with that country's National Health Service.

The Institute for America's Future: ""The case made in this brief is that this menu of health plans must include a good public plan modeled after Medicare if the broad goals of reform—universal insurance and improved value—are to be achieved. [...] First, public insurance has a better track record than private insurance when it comes to reining in costs while preserving access. By way of illustration, between 1997 and 2006, health spending per enrollee (for comparable benefits) grew at 4.6 percent a year under Medicare, compared with 7.3 percent a year under private health insurance. At the same time, Medicare has maintained high levels of provider participation and patient access to care. [...] Medicare has proven superior at cost control not just to health plans in the private sector, but also to private plans that contract with the federal government, such as those offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP)—suggesting that public insurance can outperform private plans even in the context of insurance reforms.""

1,"Public insurance makes workers healthier and more productive. A public insurance option will guarantee universal coverage, and will ensure that people with medical conditions receive the preventive care they need, which saves money in long-term health care costs. And, by ensuring that individuals do not fall ill or victim to being uninsured, a public insurance option will ensure that individuals stay economically productive.

1," Public insurance competes with private insurers, keeps them honest President Barack Obama said in March of 2009: ""[Public insurance] gives consumers more choices, and it helps keep the private sector honest, because there’s some competition out there.""[3]

2,"Employers may dump their employees into public insurance. Stuart Butler. ""The Case Against: The public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage"". Heritage Foundation. July 28, 2009: ""But there would actually be big changes for many already insured people. Faced with a low-cost public option, many employers would simply close down their existing plan and push their employees into the public plan. Remember that Wal-Mart encouraged eligible employees to sign up for Medicaid, until states and unions thwarted them. All serious analysts agree that many Americans would find themselves dumped into the public plan.""

2," Public insurance will be paid for by taxes on businesses ""The End of Private Health Insurance"". Wall Street Journal (editorial). April 13, 2009: ""Mr. Obama's proposal would be open to everyone and necessitate a huge permanent increase in government spending as a share of the economy. Medicare and Medicaid alone account for 4% of GDP today and will rise to 9% by 2035, according to the Congressional Budget Office. CBO estimates that individual and corporate income tax rates would have to rise by about 90% to finance the projected increase in spending through 2050 -- without the new middle-class entitlement.""

1,"Public insurance will give doctors/hospitals millions of new patients. It is surprising that the American Medical Association would complain about over forty million Americans suddenly having insurance so that they can pay doctors and hospitals for health care services. This is certainly a good thing for the health care industry overall (doctors in particular), despite possibly being a less than advantageous opportunity for the private health insurance industry. So what's the problem?

1,"Public insurance frees doctors from paperwork with private insurers. Washington State Congressman Jim McDermott said in July 22nd comment to Fox News: ""If things are so good [for doctors], why are doctors buried under an ever-increasing mountain of paperwork from insurance companies?""[14]
"
2,"Hospitals may be overwhelmed by new public-insurance patients. American Medical Association said in a June 2009 letter to the Senate Finance Committee that it ""cannot support any plan design that mandates physician participation... many physicians and providers may not have the capability to accept the influx of new patients that could result from such a mandate.
"
2,"Public insurance wrongly mandates physician participation. The American Medical Association wrote in a June 2009 letter to the Senate Finance Committee that the association, ""cannot support any plan design that mandates physician participation... Federal programs traditionally have never required physician or other provider participation, but rather such participation has been on a voluntary basis [...] we absolutely oppose government control of health care decisions or mandatory physician participation in any insurance plan.”[15]
"
2,"Public insurance will discourage people from becoming doctors. Public insurance, and the specter of increasingly socialized medicine, will discourage prospective doctors from entering the industry, as they will fear that their hard work will not be fairly rewarded.

1," Cooperatives are an insufficient alternative to a public option Senator John Rockefeller. Democrat from  West Virginia: ""Are cooperatives going to be effective in taking on these gigantic insurance companies? The answer is a flat no.""
"
2,"Cooperatives avoid being government-run, like public insurance. ""Cooperatives Being Pushed as an Alternative to a Government Plan"". Washington Post. August 18, 2009: ""As prospects fade for a public, or government-run, option as part of health-care reform, key senators are considering another model to create competition for private insurers: member-owned, nonprofit health cooperatives. [...] Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), the chief advocate for including cooperatives in reform legislation, has cited examples as disparate as the Land O'Lakes dairy concern, rural electricity cooperatives and Ace Hardware. [...] But so far, cooperatives have been defined in the health-care debate primarily in terms of what they are not: They would not be run by the government. [...] That may make the cooperatives more politically palatable to conservatives, as well as to some Democrats such as Conrad, who fear that the public option may be a bridge too far.""

1," US polls find a majority favor a public insurance option A March 2009 Lake Research found that 73% of voters want everyone to have a choice of private health insurance or a public health insurance plan while only 15% want everyone to have private insurance.[17]
