1," A fetus cannot have a right to a woman's body to sustain its life No individual has rights over another individual. Therefore, a fetus cannot be said to have an inviolable right to a woman's body and sustenance from that body. A woman can, therefore, decide to deprive the fetus of the usage of her body (abortion).

1," A fetus is no more a human than an acorn is a tree Judith Jarvis Thomson. ""A Defense of Abortion"". Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs, Vol. 1, no. 1 (Fall 1971). - ""Most opposition to abortion relies on the premise that the fetus is a human being, a person, from the moment of conception. The premise is argued for, but, as I think, not well. Take, for example, the most common argument. We are asked to notice that the development of a human being from conception through birth into childhood is continuous; then it is said that to draw a line, to choose a point in this development and say ""before this point the thing is not a person, after this point it is a person"" is to make an arbitrary choice, a choice for which in the nature of things no good reason can be given. It is concluded that the fetus is or anyway that we had better say it is, a person from the moment of conception. But this conclusion does not follow. Similar things might be said about the development of an acorn into an oak trees, and it does not follow that acorns are oak trees, or that we had better say they are...A newly fertilized ovum, a newly implanted clump of cells, is no more a person than an acorn is an oak tree."" 
"
2,"Women can only be ""pregnant"" with a ""child"" not merely a ""fetus"" This is similar to the above argument. The point is that pregnancy can only be called pregnancy and that you can only be pregnant with a ""child"". Nobody would ever say, ""I'm pregnant with a fetus"". Therefore, fetuses should be considered ""unborn children"" with correlating rights.

1,"Viability is a good cut-off for when abortion is appropriate or not. Anthony Kennedy, U.S. Supreme Court, speaking for the Court in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) (joint opinion coauthored with Justices Souter and O’Connor) - ""At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life....[P]eople have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail…. We conclude the line should be drawn at viability, so that, before that time, the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy....[T]here is no line other than viability which is more workable. To be sure, as we have said, there may be some medical developments that affect the precise point of viability, but this is an imprecision within tolerable limits....A husband has no enforceable right to require a wife to advise him before she exercises her personal choices.""[29]

2,Science says it's not a baby.I beg to differ.Science said it is a baby.The baby has its own DNA and at nine weeks he has a heartbeat.A baby at twelve weeks is very complex.Every organ is present.This link lists the development of a baby in the womb.PLEASE READ THIS!!!!!!!
1,Why counter a wrong with a equally wrong action?The evil of abortion is equal to the evil of rape.Only 1% of all abortions are performed because of rape or incest. (Guttmacher Institute)
2,"I find the fact that there are instances where women think that it is right to abort the birth of a child is incredibly outrageous! To think that people would rather cut of life in its entirety than to take wiser options, such as setting their child up for an adoption, or even personally entrusting the baby to someone close to them. If I could 'personally' define the word 'abortion,' then it would be as follows:'ABORTION: The term refers to the irrational decision to KILL the child before it has been birthed from the womb'I am not going to sugar-coat abortions, because it's true, they are nothing short of murder! 'The children are killed before they can even process the thought' is one term that I have seen a few times in this debate (of course they have been worded differently, but again, I am not here to sugar-coat this sort of thing), and I can say that the mother/father has STOLEN the right and privilege of thought from these children by killing them. They have also denied them of love, care, protection and most of all, they have denied them of a life.As I have stated previously, I cannot even begin to understand why so many pregnant women do not consider putting the child up for an adoption rather than simply cutting the child off completely! Surely the majority of you all would agree with me that a child has its rights even if it cannot understand them! But the second that an abortion begins, you have stripped that child of it's rights, and there is no way that you can ever make amends. And no, I am not trying to send anyone on a guilt-trip, but I would be glad to know that some of you have come to realize what exactly an abortion does, and not just to think of the process as ""stabbing someone in the vagina."""
2,"Most abortions occur at 10 weeks, can somebody please look at these pictures and please tell me what that is if it's not human. And if you dare go watch the video silent scream and please tell me what is going on there, because they sure aren't removing a clump of cells. If your are for abortion please tell me what that is they are sucking out into the trash.I don't think most people know what an abortion is, nor have they seen one. If you are for abortion at least inform yourself and watch the video silent screamand make an educated call about abortion"
1,"You're so closed minded it's ridiculous.In fact, quite a few people have experienced abortion first hand, and it's never an easy decision, but sometimes it is the right one.It doesn't matter what the thing looks like. Science tells us that thing is not yet a sentient being, therefore it is not killing a sentient being. Cute pictures does not = sound scientific reasoning.You don't like abortion. Fine, don't have one, but that you choose not to believe the fact that at ten weeks that little thing has 0 sense of self, does not constitute any type of proof that abortion should be banned for those who choose to undergo it before that thing is sentient.No one is for abortion once the child is self-aware. A self-aware human should not be aborted.That is not a self-aware human, no matter how cute. And that said, the vast vast majority of abortions take place before the first couple weeks.And that said, most science says there is not even a hint of possible self-awareness until around 26 weeks!"
2,"I guess you were not man enough to match the video Silent Scream because that video clearly show a fetus doing what you say it can't; showing signs of awareness.I also I didn't say""  few people have experienced abortion first hand"". What I said is that few really know what it is.About being ""closed minded ""it doesn't matter what the thing looks like.""If it looks human and genetically it's human; it probably is human.The question still remains unanswered: What kind of being is it? Your attempt to redefine the question hasn't changed the question, nor does it answer it. And a question not properly answered doesn't go away. That's why abortion is still a hot topic 35yrs after Roe vs Wade. There are a lot of people for whom something seems dreadfully wrong and for those of you who support abortion to dismiss us with some fancy mental gymnastics is simply inadequate. So please, answer the question.You also lose credibility with statements like these""the vast vast majority of abortions take place before the first couple weeks."" How do you abort something you don't know you have? In most cases it's a missed period that tips the woman off and that takes time. Facts are annoying things when they contradict you and you can't make them go away by changing them. Do your research first before you make assertions like this, Because for those of us who have. you lose credibility. But I think you make my point that most people don't know much about abortion. But tell me iamdavidh, were you ever an unborn baby? Because if you were. you have to acknowledge that an abortion would have killed you, not something else but you. And that means abortion kills people in the early stages of their life not something else that later becomes them, but them."
1,"Listen, you want to believe it's a living thing based on that video, fine, I'll trust science. If science says it's a sentient being, I'll be against it.In the meantime, don't make these poor girls feel worse they they already do about the whole thing.So you're against it, but obviously a lot of people think that ""silent scream"" is rubbish.You know what, beatles make a noise when you squish them. They're not sentient though, and they actually have more brains than a fetus before the first couple weeks.Meanwhile, these poor girls, half the time they were raped, or their still just kids them self,and you get these nuts calling them nazis and killers and everything else,you know what, they're not killers. I don't know what a fetus is, you don't, but science does, and science says they aren't people yet.It says they're people after the third-trimester,before then, leave these girls alone until you have some scientific proof beyond,""I really really really really feel it's a living person.""And to the last ridiculous paragraph. Had I been aborted I would have never existed, and so no, I would not have been killed. So there. I was a sperm once too, should guys stop ejaculating?"
2,"Science has been wrong in the past. If science were always blindly trusted, we would never progress. It is challenging science that makes us find new and better answers."
2,You are wrong about science saying it is not a human being.SCIENCE SAYS IT IS A HUMAN BEING.SCIENCE SAYS THAT THIS BABY IS VERY DEVELOPED AT TWELVE WEEKS.I thought you might want to know this.
2,You should spend more time thinking about what you say before you type because you are starting to appear irrational.
2,"A line on ""viability"" is arbitrary; from conception humans are always increasingly ""viable"" It is faulty to claim that a fetus can achieve ""viability"", where it becomes an independent creature and worthy of some rights. Humans are always increasing in their independence and ability to survive. In modernity, children cannot survive on their own into their teens.

I realize there is a religious coupe going on on create debate right now. But you'll get bored of being wrong eventually and move along to a site that will reinforce your misguided opinions instead of challenging them.

2,"You are good at making my point thank you. A question not properly answered never goes away, and equivocating on terms is a poor attempt to cloud the issue.It does appear you are rather uninformed about fetal development.

2,"how is stabbing a pregnant dog, the same as abortion. it is completely different. we're not saying u can stab a pregnant person but we're saying that the pregnant person should have the option to abort. not that it is ok to go and stab any person that is pregnant."
1,"Read what I was replying to. I was being facetious.Following the logic of the statement I was replying to, it would wrong to have an abortion ever under any circumstance, but something like say, stabbing a pregnant dog in the vagina, would be just fine... if one were to follow the logic,which it's become quite apparent few posting under this topic are capable of."
1,"we're saying that the pregnant person should have the option to abort.Then why is your argument tagged ""abortion should be banned""?Also funny to note is that (at this time) your post is the top post on this side!?"
1,"No answer to my retort, just a down vote. That helps alot!?"
2,"Yes, this type of stupid hypocracy must be banned!The parents have right to kill themselves but not their growing babies.Many countries face a crisis due to this. If the abortio is not a safe mode executed, then it can affect the parent's health too.Friends, How can you accept the death of an innocent infant who never harmed you?"
2,"In 95% of cases it is the woman's fault for becoming pregnant, especially in teen cases."
2,Abortion is stupid. All thes chicks that have abortions are stupid.
1,"A ban on abortion presents practical problems of enforcement: Enforcing an abortion ban would require a quite degrading and inhumane treatment of those women who wished to have their foetus terminated. Moreover, if pregnant women traveled abroad, they would be able to have an abortion in a country where it was legal. Either the state takes the draconian measure of restricting freedom of movement, or it must admit that its law is unworkable in practice and abolish it. The ‘third way’ of tacitly accepting foreign terminations would render hypocritical the much-vaunted belief in the sanctity of life. In addition, the demand for abortions will always exist; making abortion illegal, will simply drive it underground and into conditions where the health and safety of the woman might be put at risk.
"
2,"Abortion is dumb, all the woman who have any are STUPID!!!! Abortion could ruin the race of mankind!! Then we would all be dead!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!I do NOT like the idea of abortion and obama is stupid to give federal funds to abortion!!!!"
2,This is not an argument but supporting evidence of why abortion should be banned. This woman knows first hand what abortion is and what it does. If you are going to argue for abortion you will need to overcome this woman's testimony. But I bet most people will just attack her character falsely.
2,"Hi, I am a eighteen year old senior who was born two and a half months premature, a time when abortion's have been done. My mother and I were both in extream danger of dieing, my parents could have said, take it out and get my wife/myself out of danger then I would not be here today and plenty of children will never have a voice. If a mother or a couple does not want a child there is always the option of putting the child up for adoption, at least it will have a chance at life and a loveing family."
2,Thank you for your testimony. I'm so glad you spoke up and would strongly encourage you to do it more often. Apart from rape your case is the most often used justification for abortion. And as your existence proves it is not proper justification. I know of a woman ( I can't remember her name) but her mother was rapped. I know of her because she is doing public speaking on this issue of abortion.You are a testimony to the fact the abortion snuffs out a human life because it would have taken yours. Thank you again.
2,"Abortion: One Key Issue  By Gregory KouklAbortion involves killing and discarding something that's alive. Whether it's right or not to take the life of any living being depends entirely upon the answer to one question: What kind of being is it? The answer one gives is pivotal, the deciding element that trumps all other considerations.Let me put the issue plainly. If the unborn is not a human person, no justification for abortion is necessary. However, if the unborn is a human person, no justification for abortion is adequate.©1999 Gregory Koukl.

2,Many abortion doctors admit that this baby is a living human being. Many baptize the babies after the abortion is finished.
1,"Well, the question is what makes us a person, and what makes us special above those beings which are okay to kill (most animals, insects plants etc...). I would argue that it's our ability to think and feel at a higher level. An embryo cannot think, feel, see, hear, remember, or do any of the other things that distinguish us as people and therefore must be put into a separate category then a fully formed person.Considering your ignorance on the topic of biology that you demonstrated in the evolution debate, I would not be surprised if you were unaware of this, but if you don't believe me I would be happy to provide evidence (or you could save me the trouble and trust me).The question then becomes: at what point does the unborn embryo/fetus gain the rights of a full grown person? There are two extremes:1) The moment after conception.2) The moment of birth.My problem with number one is that a single celled organism shouldn't have rights that are equal to those of a person, and my problem with number two is that mere physical location (outside rather than inside the womb) shouldn't dictate whether we have rights, so I propose that the embryo/fetus gains rights over time as it develops. How early these rights are given is obviously something that is going to be debated, and, in my own opinion, should be debated because it will be a much more fruitful debate than the current ""all or nothing"" one that is all too common."
2,"The question isn't about person hood, The question is what kind of life is it?By your logic it is OK to kill another human, especially if they are smaller and less developed than you , if they can't think, feel, see, hear, or remember than by all means, kill em. What you have just done is discriminated against a whole class of humans that are inferior to you and deemed them unworthy of life by your arbitrary standard. That sounds just like the logic of the Third Reich to me. And that's exactly how they categorized it; the life unworthy of life.But let me ask you; were you ever an unborn child? If you ever were the unborn child your mother carried, then you have to accept an undeniable truth: killing that child through abortion would have killed you. Not a potential you. Not a possible you. Not a future you. Abortion would have killed you. Aren't you glad your mother didn't view you in the same crass way you view other humans in the early stages of development. You are in essence arguing for a right that could have taken that very right from you. And just for the record, most abortions are performed at about 10 weeks. I've included a link so you can see what those embryos look like at 10 weeks. And please tell me what that is if it isn't human. Also in regards the fetus's (it's a fetus at 10 weeks) ability to think, feel, see, hear and remember watch the video ""Silent Scream"" to get a sense of just what it is you are arguing for. What you'll see is a fetus (just like you once were) recoil in fear has they fight for their life. But I do warn you, the footage is extremely graphic."
1,"If it can't think, feel, see, hear, or remember; can't survive without complete and total dependence on the biology of another being; and doesn't look particularly like people -- what exactly is it that makes this a ""human""?"
2,"Well first off it's pretty obvious what makes it human, genetics.About thinking, feeling,seeing and hearing go watch the video""Silent Scream"" and tell me what that baby is doing."
2,"Difficulties of enforcement should not diminish the principles of the law: Many laws have difficulties pertaining to implementation, but these do not diminish the strength of the principle behind them: people will kill other people, regardless of your legislating against it, but it does not follow that you shouldn’t legislate against it. 
"
1,"I've seen ""Silent Scream"" four times already; I was convent-schooled and thus unsurprisingly I've been shown lots of graphically disgusting abortion pictures. And y'know what? I'm still not remotely persuaded that it is preferable to ruin women's lives or leave them to die in back alleys.DNA? Your sperm has DNA. Your hair and skin cells have DNA. Your saliva has DNA. Are sperm, hair, skin, and spit also human beings in their own rights?About ""thinking, feeling, seeing and hearing"" -- you conceded that an fetus slated for abortion is not capable of doing these things in your post above. ""By your logic . . . if they can't think, feel, see, hear, or remember than by all means, kill em."" So this new argument that ""Silent Scream"" contradicts your earlier premise that the fetus does NOT ""think, feel, see, or hear"" is simply logically inconsistent."
2,"Ok, so it's better to kill 1500 children a day than a handful of women periodicallyDNA proves humanity, that's allUm whoops, you took that out of context. Go back and read what I said. Notice how that quote starts. by your logic it doesn't say by my logic"
1,"But you posited the ""can't think, see, feel, etc."" You supplied that and you endorsed it by posting it. Notice how you did that. Can't get out by saying that your characterization was part of a criticism - it was still  your characterization.A clump of cells in utero is not a ""child."" That's why medical science has words like ""zygote"" and ""blastula"" and ""embryo"" and ""fetus.""If you are asking for my personal opinion on abortion, which you seem to be, it is that abortion is a highly imperfect solution to a very real problem; but that until we have developed and agreed as a society to disseminate a completely 100% effective, safe, and pragmatic method of birth control complete with age-appropriate sex education AND eliminated rape and abuse or coercion of children, then the societal costs of limiting abortion access much further than it already is (and it IS limited; states can regulate it after the first trimester and can ban it completely once the fetus reaches viability, and can also determine which procedures will and will not be permitted) are simply too great. Rather than banning it, we need to be working towards making abortion pretty much unneccesary. This is much harder to do than simply banning it, but does have the advantage of actually solving the problems posed both by allowing and by prohibiting abortion rather than just ignoring them."
2,"I don’t care to debate nor discuss your convoluted justifications for destroying a human fetus or embryo. My question to you: Why did your mother not destroy you while you were nothing but a cellular glob?Answer: Because your mother, and probably your father, loved you more than they loved themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Hypocrite! You are ready to justify the killing of human fetuses, while at the same time ignorant of the fact that ‘your’ bullshit argument is possible by reason of your mother’s refusal to kill you while your were nothing but a cellular glob! A female like you who is willing to justify the most cowardice of crimes against her own would-be progeny will commit any manner of crime against her own offspring. So, I think you should make certain that no cellular glob that is human in nature should ever be allowed to grow within your womb, for any child that is born of your matrix will most likely be sacrificed for your own selfish benefit.This is no argument!! Why, because, you have confessed to the innocence of killing your own would-be progeny. Down-vote all of my arguments! It still will not change the fact of your willingness to advocate not only the killing of all human fetuses (yes, all human fetuses), but the killing of your own would-be children. Go ahead! Justify yourself, for your response is nothing more than a self-justification via the state agreeing with you that should kill your un-born progeny. Oh, I can say much more about females such as you. Please, provoke me!BTW, how many children have you given birth to?"

Create Debate is not a forum for justifying the unjustifiable. Create Debate is a debating format for rational thought. Killing an un-born fetus cannot be rationalized! So, why do you stretch the intention of debate? I know! You are justifying your intent!Justifying the undebatable with debate! You are still a criminal!"
1,"Typical. You didn't come for a debate, you came for a fight. Debates are for people interested in listening to both sides and expecting to get out of it with a better understanding of the world. You came to ""correct"" people, not to understand other points of view.The undebatable? There's no such thing. Every issue is debatable. It's true that some have stronger arguments on one side than the other, but this shouldn't bother the rational person you claim to be."
2,"I’m not defending myself nor my viewpoint, I am boldly declaring the implications of the pro-abortionist. You must understand that if I am truly anti-abortionist, I will not waste time dancing and playing with individuals who promote the killing of human fetuses. I did not come for a fight as you have claimed, what I came for was an intellectual abortion of anti-fetus rhetoric. The undebatable? There's no such thing. Every issue is debatable.

1,"As I said, some debates have much stronger arguments to one side.1 is not 4.I agree. If both numbers refer to the same kind of thing, 1 is not 4. 1 banana is not 4 bananas. One could argue that, if it's not specified, 1 could be 4... For example, 1 family might have exactly 4 people in it. In this case, 1 (family) is 4 (people). But if the numbers are just shown without ""units"", it's usually implied that they are probably referring to the same thing. Therefore, 1 is not 4.If you have your arguments in order, every issue is debatable. It's just that some are closer to a consensus than others..."
1,"Doctors that have difficulty performing abortions still acknowledge its importance. Many people have trouble with parts of their profession. A general, for instance, has trouble sending his troops to their death, but typically acknowledges the need for this to occur in certain instance. Abortion doctors, similarly, might be challenged by the process of an abortion (and even believe that they are ""killing"" the fetus), but nevertheless acknowledge the need for abortions and so are comfortable with their profession. The difficulty doctors experience in performing abortions, therefore, is not an argument against abortions.

The proposition is not an accounting statement. It is a proposition that asserts that 1 and 4 are not predicable of each other. In fact if that proposition is debatable then the law of mathematics is without a foundation. Your arguments fail to debate the proposition, 1 is not 4 , but yet argues distinctly different propositions."
1,"I think that referring to mathematical rules as ""laws"" is the kind of misleading argument religious people like to use when implying that when using mathematics you require faith. Mathematics are not the ultimate truth about anything, neither should they be treated as unchangeable laws of the universe. Mathematics, as well as physics, chemistry, etc. are a set of tools invented by humans in order to explain phenomena we observe around us. We made sciences up, and it's up to us to upgrade them in order to improve our knowledge about the world.Here I didn't go as far as to point a flaw in mathematics or something that should be changed, I actually agreed that in most cases 1 is not 4, and I know how useful that is in our daily life. My point is, we can and should question and debate everything, even the foundations of something which has been working for us all along, because we can never know when old explanations might fail us. This is specially valid for the question of abortion, since our old conceptions about when life begins might be wrong.Anyways, if my semantic discussion of 1 not being 4 was not mathematical enough for you, here I got another one...""1 is not 4""Wrong, this is not always the case. When dealing with binary numbers, when 1 is in the third number from the right, as in 100, 1 represents 4. In 111, 100, 10100, and so on, the third 1 is always 4 (as in the decimal system)."
2,"I think you are misunderstanding what a logical proposition is. True, we can pretend to debate everything by use of fallacious thoughts, but when an argument is illogical nothing is debated.However, in a sense we can irrationally argue everything! Agreed!You have claimed that “all issues are debatable” while at the same time failing to support your proposition. The fallacious arguments you have submitted fail to refute my proposition and consequently indicate that only my proposition, i.e. not all issues are debatable, is axiomatic. There is not one axiom you have affirmed that is evidence of your assertion, “All issues are debatable”.The only logical and axiomatic proposition of this debate is simply: Some issues are debatable."
1,"So going back to abortion... you say that an illogical argument is not-debatable. So could you explain what is illogical about debating abortion? Clearly, just by being here you dispute your own statement. It seems to me that you are just going around the issue without proving that killing a non-fully developed fetus is the same thing as killing a 3 year old child. Prove your statement without evading the debate and calling it ""illogical"". - Or else prove why it is illogical to debate this."
2,"The principle of pro-abortion: Human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial. Welcome to a self-evident truth.1. The pro-abortionists could dispute the words of the principle, but in doing such the pro-abortionist must necessarily contradict the pro-abortionist view. 2. The anti-abortionist has no reason to debate the principle because the truth of the principle is self evident. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that anti-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born offspring. And furthermore, you will not be mistaken if you think pro-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born progeny for themselves. Now, let’s see if you and I can logically debate the principle I have affirmed of pro-abortionists.Seriously, let’s attempt a debate amongst one another as a test of my ability to reason. Good luck!"
2,"the truth of the principle is self evident.? You mean that, in your opinion, the principle is false, right? First, logically explain me why do you think this is absolutely false, as in, there's absolutely no situation in which this could be true, no matter which other factors are involved.No, the principle of pro-abortion is: “Human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial.” The principle is true to fact; it is not false to fact. My assertion is indicating the ethical standard of pro-abortionists. I am not saying that their principle is good or just, I am affirming the principle of their agenda.Now, consider the principle of the anti-abortionist: Human fetuses and embryos are not sacrificial.Does this help? Also, I'd like to say that I'm not sure about my opinion on abortion... I do think that interrupting a pregnancy is not good, but I cannot simply ignore the problems an undesired child might bring to its family and society. At this point in my life, I wouldn't consider abortion, but I don't feel like I can make this decision for other people, so I wouldn't like it to be ""banned"". This matter puzzles me, so I don't usually join debates related to it. I just came into this one because I saw your comment about criminals and the undebatable, so now I'm here just looking forward to seeing you logically prove that there's absolutely no situation in which sacrificing a human embryo is the less of two evils. I'm looking forward to a debate.I’ll reply to this part after we clearly understand one another about the truth of the principle of pro-abortion. This is a fair approach."

Lastly, if I make (as you claim) an ass of myself it certainly was not for myself; for I am a man of substance and not image, and the substance I represent justifies every mother-to-be who has chosen to keep her baby. You, on the other hand, are nothing but image, and hence your image is the result of winning or losing a debate about terminating the lives of unborn fetuses. Great Image no doubt!"
2,"Partial-birth abortion.That is all I have to say and I get the chills.This abortion is usually performed in the third trimester.The baby is forced into the birth canal legs first and everything except the head is delivered. The doctor then stabs the head while it is still in the canal and sucks out the brains.I will say some very important facts:At nine weeks a baby has a heartbeat.At 4.5 months he can feel pain.This baby, this human being can feel the stab of the knife. He can feel himself dying."
2,"By the end of the 1st trimester a baby can think, see, hear, remember, and many other things.What is the difference between killing a baby nine weeks after conception and murdering baby nine weeks after birth?Tell me! I want to know.An abortion doctor failed to abort a baby and he was born alive. So the doctor took the baby and killed him. The doctor was not charged with murder but was charged with the failure to abort the baby."
2," Doctors that perform abortions are often emotionally damaged Anonymous abortion doctor, quoted by Jack Hitt in ""Who Will Do Abortions Here?"", New York Times Magazine, January 18, 1998 - ""[Doing abortions] can make you feel bad ... No matter how pro-choice you are, it makes you feel low.""[30]

1,"Whether it's right or not to take the life of any living being depends entirely upon the answer to one question: What kind of being is it? The answer one gives is pivotal, the deciding element that trumps all other considerations.Depends entirely ? Heavily for sure but I am not buying entirely."
1,... So I can find a pregnant dog and stab it in the vagina?
1,"Abortion should be legal. The government should never have the right to make decisions pertaining to one's own body and/or a decision to bring a child into the world or not. It takes the moral responsibility to do what is right away from the individual and this would cause us to become more and more conditioned to behave in whatever ways the establishment chooses to mold us. It would contradict the very core of what it means to be free.If we make abortion illegal, shouldn't we also make adoption? In case you don't know, the business of adoption is in the billions per year. Making abortion illegal would bolster this industry even further, and allow desperate people to become ""baby merchants"", for profit. An example would be a girlfriend of mine who needed money and decided to sell her eggs. What moral ground does that hold? Not to mention the financial burden more children would put on the American people in light of high inflation and low wages, health care costs, education etc. Forcing you to keep a child could very well sink many families into poverty. To me, the person undertaking an abortion has enough to deal with that they don't need my opinion on their moral character on top of it. They don't need my judgement because they're the ones having to live with that decision. And of course legal abortion would come with regulations to protect it from abuse. I think there's a lot that can be done to provide people the freedom of choice without allowing them to abuse that freedom, just like many other things in this country. If we make abortion illegal, adoption agencies might start to look like dog pounds.I think we need to believe that the majority of people in this country, and around the world, are good people seeking nothing more than the best chance at living a healthy and happy life. We are not all predisposed to moral corruption, poor decision making and ignorance. If we want to prosper as a nation we have to believe in our fellow man and that he will do what's right, however, that faith will not come without regulations to protect the system from those of us that would abuse it."
2,"There are thousands of people who want to take these children because they cannot have their own. If you do not want a child, have it and put it up for adoption. At least you will be preserving a human life rather than killing one."
1,"The debate is not about whether or not abortion is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a pregnant woman carry a child to term. There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy. There are even more reasons a woman may choose to abort that are not good. Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the woman and her doctor apply when making these tough decisions? I don't think so.Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of abortions performed when there are better options? People like me who abhor abortion need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center."
2,"You say;There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy. I'd like to hear one.But to answer your question about the role of government in these affairs please consider the following: ""We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."" Taking the life of another person is an injustice, destroys domestic tranquility, destroys general welfare and robs the individual of the blessings of liberty, If government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights what good is it?This is how our Founding Fathers saw it: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness""Please note the use of the word ""all"" The decision handed down in Roe vs Wade stripped a whole class of people their rights by denying their humanity.This ruling goes against the very Constitution itself; It is a disgrace. As I said earlier it turns the law on it's head, the very law it is supposed to uphold. It appears this court has become destructive of the purpose for which it was founded and according to the Deceleration of Independence it is our duty to do something about."
1,"There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy.I'd like to hear one.In some cases an abortion may be life saving to the pregnant woman. I don't think that a woman who chooses abortion to save her own life is committing an immoral act.Taking the life of another person is an injusticeIn general I agree that is true, but you yourself admit that sometimes it is justifiable to take a life DO YOU NOT?If government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights what good is it?I never said that ""government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights"". Whatever just authority it does have is derived from the consent of the governed.How far do we let government go ""protecting"" us. There are a million more laws I'm sure that can be shoved down our throats in the name of protection. Our right to privacy applies at some point, and I think health care decisions made in a doctor's office merit that privacy from government intrusion."
2,"That scenario of the endangered mother is rare. The vast majority of abortions are performed on healthy women and children. You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm.The right to life is the most fundamental right, everything else stands or falls on this one issue. When we as a people deny that right to a whole class of people we have undercut ourselves.In regards the taking of life; I agree with you, but not when it comes to abortion. And just to be clear, an unjustified action is unjust. I'm convinced that an abortion is unjustified for the reasons commonly given.In regards how far: I think the Constitution makes that clear, but Roe vs Wade undercuts that very Constitution.This isn't a debate about some theoretically fetus somewhere. This is about the 1500 lives that are snuffed out daily in our land and it's about you and I because it affects you and I. Don't think laws like this can stand without serious ramifications.  Just consider that 1/3 of our population has been exterminated since Roe vs Wade. Do you think that has an affect on Social Security now that there are more people drawing from it than paying into it. What of the effects on health care? How many doctors and scientist were exterminated"
1,"You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm.maybe not based on, but exceptions to the norm should at times bear heavily during the legislative process.The right to life is the most fundamental right, everything else stands or falls on this one issue.So the argument is... that since the right to privacy from government intrusion is not as of high a priority as the right to life, the government therefore ought to have full access to any medical health records related to pregnant women so they can follow up and make sure abortions are not performed by state licensed doctors? If a teen girl was found pregnant she could be arrested for underage sex and could carry to term while incarcerated........ready to be made into a movie...jeezI think that in a very real sense, the right to ""reproductive privacy"" precedes the ""right to life"". I would love to read a response to this particular point.In regards the taking of life; I agree with you, but not when it comes to abortion.Yes I understand you are a firm proponent of the death penalty....isn't it true?...oh right I remember the logic ""You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm""You don't have to convince me that high abortion rates represent the deepest poverty. I need to be convinced that government intervention (invasion to the privacy thereof) in doctor/pregnant woman relations is merited. Remember I think that the right to life depends on reproductive privacy."
2,"Let me address the point you are making here:that since the right to privacy from government intrusion is not as of high a priority as the right to life, the government therefore ought to have full access to any medical health records related to pregnant women so they can follow up and make sure abortions are not performed by state licensed doctors?If I'm torturing little babies in my basement are you saying that I have a right to privacy from government intrusion? And if I'm a doctor I have more of a right to do what I want? Don't you think this goes against one of the reasons for licensing doctors, public safety? Again I say; If a government has not right to protect life, what good is it.On the issue of the death penalty. The principal in play for me on this issue and abortion is the same; the sanctity of human life."
2," The Hippocratic oath forbids doctors from performing abortions Hippocratic Oath, attributed to the school of Hippocrates, the “Father of Medicine,” circa 400 B.C. - ""I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion.""[31]
"
1,"If I'm torturing little babies in my basement are you saying that I have a right to privacy from government intrusion?It is true that laws enacted to protect privacy rights also provide opportunity for secret wrongdoing.Jstantall, you agree that abortions are sometimes medically necessary correct me if I am wrong.You think that a doctor/pregnant woman relationship should not be private but court monitored to make sure doctors don't commit murder. Again correct me if I am wrong."
2,Very little of all abortions are performed because of the baby threatening the mother's life.Even less abortions are performed because the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.Most reasons are not enough money for a baby; partner/family does not want me to keep the baby.
1,"Taking the life of another person. . . is not what happens in an abortion, because a fetus is not a ""person.""Roe didn't strip any class of ""people"" of rights, because a fetus is not a person.Nothing about the abortion right is unconstitutional, because (get ready for it): a fetus is not a person.Never in the history of U.S. law has a fetus been a ""person,"" and a fetus is not a ""person"" under the law of the EU either.Are you getting the part where you went wrong yet?"
2,"The question is not about person-hood, but humanity and that is genetically verifiable. Answer the question, what kind of being is it? Everything else is superfluous.And just so you know what side you stand on; your argument is similar to those who supported slavery, they are not full persons and therefore have no rights under the law.So let me qoute you using the word slavery in place of fetus and maybe you can see where you went wrongNothing about the right to slavery is unconstitutional, because (get ready for it): a slave is not a person.Never in the history of U.S. law has a slave been a ""person,"" and a slave is not a ""person"" under the law of Britain either. A slave is property and therefore one can do with it as one sees fit."
1,"Your argument fails in that a human who has been born, whether freed or enslaved, is a life in being -- i.e., someone who is an autonomous life fully developed to the point of not being physiologically dependent on another being for basic bodily functions. We recognize that autonomous, born human beings share certain basic rights. These rights do not extend to clumps of cells which are wholly dependent on another living being for their existence. Therefore your analogy does not actually equate at all."
2,"A clump of cells is not what is aborted, do your research first. But let's say they are for the sake of the argument; what kind of cells are they? chicken? no they are human.On the issue of dependency: you are wholly dependent on other living beings for your existence. By your logic it would be OK to kill you if the issue of dependency was all that was needed to justify your death. And further more we could extend this to the mentally and physically handicapped. It could apply to the sick and suffering, people with cancer and all those in hospitals. The logic you use is exactly the logic the Third Reich used when it began doing these very things; long before it got to exterminating 6 million Jews.You may agree with the Third Reich that there is such thing as a life unworthy of life, but I don't. A child conceived is worthy of life and should have every opportunity to live it."
1,"Your argument is specious. The sick and handicapped are not at issue. People with cancer are not at issue. None of them have hooked themselves up to the bodies of autonomous adults whose physiological functions are then used to regulate their own.And of course, the first one to make an overblown comparison between the issue at hand and Nazism is inevitably the loser in any given debate."
2,"I'm questioning the underlying principle in play here and there is a connection between all the examples I gave. if you can't see the underlying principle here I don't know what to tell you. The argument looks like this:X is not worthy of life because of Y, therefore we're justified in killing it.Now just put Jews, slaves, embryos or what ever in place of ""X"" and put your reason in place of ""Y"" and you've got your argument.Can you see the analogy between them now? So my principal objection is with the ""Y"" when you have an embryo for ""X"""
1,"Jews, slaves, etc. are all beings in their own right, not dependent on the womb of another. So no, your argument does not hold up."
2,"Notice what you have done; You've imposed an arbitrary standard (dependent on the womb of another) and then said it is OK to kill any human being who doesn't meet this standard. That standard can be slid anywhere up or down, from conception to old age. It's what is know as moral relativism and it's a morally bankrupt ethic. The question is not; at what point can we kill it, but what is it?You need to first establish that this standard of yours is morally justified because I'm not persuaded that it is."
1,"It is contradictory to oppose abortion while supporting capital punishment. Loesje, Dutch Fictional character ""Active and International girl"", b.1983 - “How can anyone be against abortion but for the death penalty”[32]
"
1,"Old age? How's that work? No ""human being"" is going to be dependent on the womb of another for more than about 10 months. Once it's out of the womb, it is by definition no longer dependent on said womb for survival.The standard is flexible, not arbitrary. It is flexible to a certain defined degree (as it should be) and that degree should, to my thinking, correspond to the level of prenatal physiological development. In other words, rights vest as the being grows and matures."
2,"All of us were once a fetus. That is a child. Obviously, none of you chose to watch the posted video, silent screams? Or how about the facts about a 10 week fetus. The whole argument is whether it is a person or not. Just because the law says it not, does not make that right. We are challenging the law. This is also our constitutional right."
1,"All of us were once a fetus. Agree.That is a child.Disagree: unsupported leap in logic. The organism passes through varied stages of development between ""fertilized egg"" and ""child.""Obviously, none of you chose to watch the posted videoIncorrect assertion. Watched it, multiple times, not in favor of outlawing abortion.We are challenging the law. This is also our constitutional right.Yup, that's your right, but since SCOTUS has already rejected ""it's a person it's a child"" not just once but many times, continuing to just assert ""it's a person it's a child"" while citing to a video from 25 years ago is probably not a very strong argument with which to challenge the law."
2,In the third trimester it is actually safer to have a c-section than it is to have in an abortion.At nine weeks a baby has a heartbeat.At 4.5 months he can feel pain.There is no good reason to have an abortion!!!
2,"I'd like add a different perspective to your argument. I've changed one key word, tell me if it changes anything.The debate is not about whether or not slavery is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a man may not have a slave. There are various good reasons for having slaves. There are even more reasons a man may choose to have a slave that are not good. Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the buyer and seller apply when making these tough decisions? I don't think so.Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of slaves traded when there are better options? People like me who abhor slavery need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center.Hope that clears things up for you."
1,I agree 100%. This is a cultural issue and not a political one.
1,i agree 100 percent with you. the government shouldnt force someone to not have an abortion.
1,"This is stupid. The simple fact of all of this is let people decide what they want to do with teir bodies, I am so sick of republicans saying ""no more government"" then they have these ""rules"" which make more decisions for us. Total hypocrisy. You have a right to choose is my stance on everything."
2,"I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions.Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception: Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being. This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby. First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should. There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.  Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law. In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong. WORDS: 981"
1,"Um, that doesnt prove anything except what it actually is. When a woman becomes pregnant she starts going through a hormonal change to adjust for this really huge thing that is about to happen to her life. It is natures way of preparing a woman for motherhood. When the baby is lost, through abortion, miscarriage, or accident, all women go back to normal hormones in a quick fashion and it causes depression. If you think that a woman feeling guilty about the abortion isnt misplaced emotion then let me tell you a general story that I am sure relates to every woman on the planet. When you get all emotional and upset because your bf or husband does not put the dishes in the right place or some other lame ass reason for getting upset, do you really think that that is really the issue? Is it really not your period or your mom not listening to you? Yes it is. So misunderstanding your emotions and where they stem from is how you define ""woman""."
2,"An abortion kills innocents; capital punishment kills the guilty There is no contradiction between opposing abortions and supporting capital punishment, as many conservatives do. An abortion involves killing an innocent fetus, whereas capital punishment involves killing a guilty, terrible human being. One involves killing an unborn baby with the potential to contribute positively to society, the other kills a human being that has demonstrated themselves unfit to live in society. The real inconsistency is in supporting abortion while opposing capital punishment.
"
2,"But who is going to choose for the unborn child? Like I said was premature, if my parents had chosen to abort me then I would never had the chance to call out my ideas, have you ever thought of that?"
2,There is a name for that it's called Anarchy and every society that embraces it collapses.
1,"This is a speech that i found:On behalf of the Salt & Light team, I would like to speak to you about a subject that is near and dear to our hearts. Today is National Sanctity of Human Life day. Perhaps you have noticed the pro-life sign in front of our church. If not, I invite you to look at it after the service this morning.Thirty years ago, the United States Supreme Court made up a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. Since then there have been 44 million abortions. There have been 112 million births. Using those two numbers, one can calculate that 28 percent of all pregnancies have ended in abortion. Everyday the number of babies killed by abortionists approximately equals the 3,000 killed by terrorists on September 11, 2001.Now I believe that I do not have to convince anyone here in this church about the evilness and tragedy of abortion. But, if anyone remains unconvinced, go over to our nursery, pick up a little baby, hold it in your arms and gaze into its eyes and you will know the truth. All the pro-choice pro-abortion rhetoric will just melt away.The real question to be asked is why, in this predominately-Christian nation, do we tolerate this practice? I have spent three years trying to answer that question. I must tell you that I am totally amazed. There really should be no debate at all about abortion. The truth should be clear to everyone. It should be a slam-dunk that abortion should not be tolerated. It should not be legalized. And it should not be a choice. After studying this issue, I now understand how Adolf Hitler was able to pull off the holocaust. It took a tremendous amount of propaganda, lies, and deceit. The Nazis were able to morally confuse many people. It took many good Christians in Germany closing their eyes and remaining silent.Well the same thing is true today in the United States of America. There are a relatively few passionate activists who loudly spread pro-choice pro-abortion propaganda, lies, and deceit. They are able to morally confuse many people in our country. It is a sad truth that most Christians in all denominations have closed their eyes and have remained silent.The abortion struggle has corrupted our politics. Legalized abortion is so entrenched in our government because one of our two major political parties has embraced it. To even be considered a viable candidate in that party one must blindly accept the doctrine of legalized abortion. This has made it difficult for the Christians who are traditionally members of that party. Every election cycle, pro-choice candidates try to give Christians reasons to vote for them on other issues. And so, too many Christians forget about abortion as they go vote. They often provide the margin of victory for pro-choice pro-abortion candidates. If a miracle were to happen and those Christians were to hold a little baby in their arms and gaze into his or her eyes just before stepping into the voting booth, our system of abortion would disappear after the very next election.In conclusion, the most important thing I have learned during these last three years is that the future of abortion is totally in the hands of Christians. We really do have the political power to solve this problem. Our cultural enemies know this and they are scared. They desperately work to demonize and marginalize us. We do not have to convince the sinful pro-choice activists that they are wrong about abortion. We do not have to convince the radical feminists, the biased news media, or the morally corrupt politicians. To win, all we have to do is convince our fellow Christians to truly follow Christ and there is no doubt that they will vote pro-life."
1,"If I was raped, lets say by...my father, and i got pregnant at the age of 14, it would not be mentally healthy for me to go through with my pregnancy! It would wreak havoc on my own psyche and screw my child over from the abnormal hormone fluctuations [stress is bad for the baby in utero]. If the pregnancy would be damaging in any way to the mother, because it really is her choice, I believe abortion is appropriate. I AM NOT SAYING IT SHOULD BE USED AS BIRTH CONTROL. If you have more than one abortion because of your own stupid mistakes, then yes, you most definitely carry the baby to term and put it up for adoption. But if the pregnancy is going to be damaging, get the abortion as soon as possible."
1,"No abortion should not be banned, it is the peoples choice if they wish to have a child not be forced to have it, especially if they are young. Shame on the people who say it should be banned. How would you like to be forced to do something??"
2,For one thing people are forced to do things all the time and i suggest you watch an abortion. Did you know that they just vacume it out like a dust bunny as it is screaming and its limbs are being torn off? Take that into acount next time you think about that.
1,"i think it depends on the circumstances. if you were raped, and then got pregnant, would you still keep the child. Certainly it shouldn't be a form of birth control, but in some cases it should be allowed. besides if your argument is that we would be taking a life then wouldn't we have to stop anything that takes a life such as war, the death penalty, and meat production?"
1,"It shouldn't. It's the parents choice, if you can't take care of a child you shouldn't have on in the first place. Although there's plenty of other choices to do with your kid like give up for adoption sell for weed what ever, it's nobodies choice to choose for the parents. You have your own choices, abortion can be one of them. Especially in poverty or if you're simply a druggy. Plus, we don't need another GANGSTER or drug dealer in the world. Just saying !!!"
2,Who says the kid will turn into a gangster? Just saying. I think that when a parent considers abortion they should take into acount the voice that is being silanced.
1,"some ignorant people (mostly men, of course). for women, how would you feel if you didn't want to have a child and an accident happened, with a condom or birth control or anything else. what if abortion was illegal? because procreation is such a burden on women anyway, between periods, pregnancy, and the birth, don't you think that women should at least have a choice? (By the way: if you want to talk about the baby being alive as it's a growing egg, well here's the thing, everything on this is formed with cells and bacteria so think about that next time you shoot a deer or something.)"
1,"The reproductive rights movement has no genocidal drive: No serious proponents of abortion are out to kill all embryos. Furthermore, it is an insult to the memory of the alive and conscious human beings murdered by the Nazis to equate them with embryos for anti-abortion propaganda.

2,"There needs to be improved sex ed in society. How does that solve this issue? Just because people will try to do something outside the law, does not mean the government should just make it legal."
1,isn't it true that around 50% of all pregnancy's are not plannedisn't it true that the USA has one of the highest teen pregnancy ratesisn't is true that higher abortion rates are directly linked to the non-availability of contraceptionso why do we have abstinence-only policy's that are proven not to work
2,"You can't get pregnant or contract an STD if your not having sex outside of marriage. We set high standards for our children's education and hold them to it. Why not set high standards for them sexually also, since nothing curtails an education like a pregnancy. Abstinence is the only practice that provides 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy, nothing else comes close.There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it? If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life. I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of an innocent human being. The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human."

2," Abortion is a form of eugenics and mass murder Norman Haire, letter to the editor, Birth Control Review, (July, 1930) - ""For those who cannot be educated, sterilization or legalized abortion seems to be the only remedy, for we certainly do not want such stupid people to pollute the race with stupid offspring. The defective conditions of life call urgently for improvement.""[33]

1,"You can't get pregnant or contract an STD if your not having sex outside of marriage.Well, that's totally goofy and wrong. Married women get pregnant all the time. (Oh and here's a total shocker: not all married women want to get pregnant.) And of course if your spouse has an STD and you have sex with your spouse, you can catch it.Nor does abstinence ""provide 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy,"" since rape and child molestation do happen.And finally, there are a great many ""questions when it comes to abortion"" -- including the safety and wellbeing of the woman, the privacy of family decisions, the right to bodily autonomy, the state's interest in the life and health of its citizens, the relative value that should be placed on the life of the developing being, and the stage of development at which such value should attach or be assessed -- just to name a few off the cuff."
1,"Actually, you can contract an STD not having sex outside of marriage. Or, to avoid the double negative, having sex strictly with your spouse. It takes TWO people to make sex. So, you not having sex outside of marriage doesn't necessitate that he/she will as well. It would require both parties abstain to attain the ""high sexual standards"" you propose setting. What are our current sexual standards by comparison? As far as abortion goes, there are clearly differing opinions on when life begins. As such, let doctors inform the law on when defining characteristics appear, and let women make the choice on moral judgement."
2,"If you and your spouse have no STDs and you have sex with no one else how could you possible get an STD apart from a mishap at the doctors? The only safe sex is that in a monogamous marriage. there is no question to when life begins: it's life throughout. The question is what kind of life?So, if I make the choice to kill my neighbor using my own moral judgment; it's ok?"
1,"If you and your spouse have no STDs and you have sex with no one else how could you possible get an STD apart from a mishap at the doctors?1. kissing your mom during a herpes outbreak, then making oral with your spouse.2. a bar fight 3. eating an infected chimp you didn't cook long enough with an open soar in your mouth4. forgetting to cover a public toilet seat after someone with an outbreak on their thighs forgot to put the cover on a public toilet seatProbably many more.But that's not the point. The point is people have been having sex with or without protection for hundreds of thousands of years, and they're not about to stop now no matter how hard you stuff your fingers in your ears and how loud you yell ""LALALALALALA"" with your eyes closed while stomping your feat and praying.keep trying though"
1,"My point is you're forced to rely on your spouse having been a virgin prior to marriage as well. And you'll really only ever be 100% sure of your own sexual history. So really the only safe sex is to take a vow of abstinence. For life. There is certainly question to when life begins. You say it's life throughout. What marks the beginning stage then? The question is not what kind of life. What does that even mean? And of course it's not ok to kill your neighbor. Nice try. Your neighbor is a fully grown person, and does not live inside of you for 9 months. Considering that a fetus lives inside you (and if brought to term must be raised by you for 18 years), you have a little more say over it's existence. And, to paraphrase Obama, pregnant women tend to make the best choices on whether or not they are stable enough to raise children. I agree that we should have better access to contraception. We can certainly both agree that we should minimize numbers of abortions as possible. And access to contraception would certainly cut down on abortions. Sexual education about contraception is also key. Abstinence only does not work."
2,"Abstinence prior to marriage (both parties) and fidelity within marriage is the safest sexual practice period. That's the ideal anything less than that is a degradation.On the beginning of life; According to the text book definition of life both the egg and sperm are alive. At the point of conception you have a complete DNA and a different one from both parents. That's an accepted scientific fact that is not in question. The question is what kind of life? cat, dog or a chicken? Nope, humans produce humans.About killing your neighbor; So long as he is not fully grown I can kill him? So, if it's the neighbors kid who I have been raising for the past nine months since his parents abandoned him; it's OK to kill him if I determine that I'm no longer stable enough to raise him? and even more so if I raised him for the last 18yrs? Yeah right. Try that in a court of law.Why do you think we should reduce the number of abortions? Is it because you know in your heart of heart that it takes the life of a human being in the early stages of development?We are drowning in a sea of condoms and sex ed and it has increased the rate of abortion, not decreased it. Abstinence has not been tried and found wanting, but found hard and left untried. Come on let's set high standards for ourselves and our kids, not low ones."
1,"It is a degradation to you, perhaps. Others believe differently. Why should we legislate based on your moral beliefs? Let's face it, unmarried people have impulses, desires, etc. They are going to act on it. Wouldn't you rather they have the tools to prevent pregnancy than not have them? Perhaps I should have been more specific in my example. A baby grows inside of you. So technically, it is a part of you. A part of your body. You are not obliged to see it to term if you choose not to. This is why a ban on abortion would fail. We should reduce the number of abortions because it's a very heartbreaking decision for a woman to come to. No woman comes to it lightly. When someone decides to end the life inside her, it is because she knows that it is a better choice than condemning the chiild to a lifetime of unhappiness. Some come to it because they know they cannot overcome an addiction and thus cannot bring a healthy child to term. Others because they know they cannot financially support the child. Others because they live in abusive homes that they don't want to subject a child to. Whatever the reason, it's certainly not an easy choice to make. So providing resources for these women such as education and contraception, can make a world of difference. As for your last argument, what substantiates your claim? From the University of California study on abstinence only and comprehensive sex education: Behavior research cannot make judgments about social values, but it can evaluate the success of school-based curricula at producing tangible outcomes for young people. The weight of the evidence from peer-reviewed scientific journals clearly shows that some comprehensive sex education programs can reduce behavior that puts young people at risk of HIV, STIs and unintended pregnancy, and that these programs do not promote earlier onset of sexual activity or an increased number of sexual partners among adolescents. By contrast, little if any credible research exists to substantiate the claims that abstinence-only programming leads to positive behavior change among youth.The credible research sends a clear message to policy makers: if the goal of school-based sex education is to increase positive health outcomes for youth, comprehensive (or “abstinence- plus”) sex education is the proven effective choice. Abstinence-only programming runs the serious risk of leaving young people, especially those at elevated risk, uninformed and alienated."
2,"It's a degradation when it deviates from the purpose for which it was designed. A law should be based on what is right, not personal preference. I would prefer adults control their desires in order that society might function at its best. What if my desire wasn't sexual, let's say I have a strong desire to shoot people who make me mad. Should I act on it? You will say that hurts people and sex doesn't. Really, check out Ted Bundy's story sometime or the thousands of others like it. Consider child pornography, rape etc etc. Or maybe the sexual abuse of women doesn't bother you. Sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties. And if you disagree you are numb to it's effect. However, if you don't have sex you don't get pregnant. And you can't transmit sexually transmitted diseases without sexual contact. It's that simple.About that baby, it's not a part of you. It has it's own unique DNA. It's not yours, so it's not you. It is a unique and separate human being that you happen to be hosting. That is the undisputed consensus.about reducing the numbers of abortions: So if I make a heartbreaking decision after a heavy consideration to start killing all homeless people because they are sad, addicted, get beat up and we as a society can't support them anymore. It's OK because it was a hard decision? Yeah right, try that defense in a court of law. None of those reasons you give come close to proper justification for the taking of human life. A pregnancy is not the kids fault, but it is the parents responsibility. And kids should never get the death penalty because their parents don't want to take responsibility for them. The right thing to do is give them to someone who will.Have you ever had any success with something that you decided from the start that it would never work. Trouble is there are more voices telling kids to have sex than not. Suppose it was the other way around, what do you think would happen to all these problems? Go away? No, but they might return to the levels they were at prior to the sexual revolution. Abstinence only worked well in this country for awhile to curb these problems. And perfection is never a requirement for law. it's meant to reduce the numbers. Slow our stampede into social anarchy if you will."
1,"Ah, now we get to the core of your argument. Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making? So basically, sex is not for pleasure, only for babies? Gay sex is wrong, then? Or sex between infertile married couples? Laws should be based on protecting other people, not on morality. Just like drugs, gambling, and prostitution ought to be legal, so long as those activities do not hurt others. Your statement that ""sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties"" is laughable. Many people enjoy sex before marriage and find it to be an enriching part of their relationships. Just because you don't doesn't mean they are wrong. What effect am I numb to? Orgasm? Hardly. ""It is a uniue and separate human being that you happen to be hosting""--like a parasite? So you should be able to choose whether or not to play host for 9 months. Stop trying to relate my examples to murder. You and I both know the distinct differences between killing a group of cells that live within you and that you are ultimately responsible for and killing an independent person. You claim that adoption is the ""only ethical choice"" for parents who are unable to care for their children, but this distinctly ignores two of the possible reasons I gave for abortion. 1-Addicts cannot bring a healthy child to term, 2-Abused women cannot hide a pregnancy and then give a child up for adoption. It also assumes that there would be enough of a ""market"" for adopted children if abortion were suddenly banned. Rates of children being given up would sky rocket, but would rates of parents wanting to adopt also rise? Prohibition never works. Prohibition on alcohol didn't work. Prohibition on marijuana is not working. Prohibition on sex before marriage cannot and will not work. Prohibition fails. Period.Nobody is ""telling kids to have sex"". We're providing sexual education so that if they make that choice, they will be informed on how to be healthy and responsible. I can't believe you'd rather have them NOT be informed, on the logic that if they DON'T know how to have responsible sex that they'll simply choose not to have it. Did you bother reading the study I linked to? I'll reiterate the key points of their findings. 1-Comprehensive sex education DOES reduce rates of pregnancy and STD's, 2-Comprehensive sex education DOES NOT increase rates of teenage sexual activity, 3-Abstinence only education DOES NOT reduce rates of teenage sexual activity. So, basically, the findings were that people are going to have sex, and try as you might, we can't dictate YOUR morality to them. Tricky thing about morals, they're all relative. If people are going to have sex, and IF abstinence only education has been proven to be ineffective at reducing rates of sex or pregnancy or STD's, then why would we continue to stick to it? To appease your moral beliefs? Again, laws are not, contrary to your belief, about morals. They are about people. And so long as sex is consensual, nobody needs protecting from it. Except perhaps you, since you so obviously find offense in the act of love. I suggest this. Teach YOUR children your moral beliefs regarding sex. But for the sake of society, let's teach all children (including yours) what it means to be responsible with regards to sex. Just in case they fall off the high bar you've set for them. Wouldn't you rather they fall without HIV? Or an unwanted pregnancy?"
2,"Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making?  I never said it's sole purpose was procreation. The core question is one of anthropology; does man have a nature and is that nature fixed? You would apparently say no and that man gets to define that nature. Laws should be based on ethics, not morality. However if mans nature is not fixed there can't be law or morality. Because there is no way man ought to be and no norm from which to deviate from. Everything becomes a matter of personal preference and taste. Everyone does what is right in their own eyes. That is anarchy and society crumbles.Second paragraph: Never said there was no pleasure in it; just that their was a cost that is hidden from your eyes. I could never get you to drink poison if I was upfront about the effects. But if I kept that information from you and packaged it good enough; it wouldn't be hard Case in point; homosexuality. harmless? The average life expectancy for a gay male is 45yrs almost half of heterosexual males. There really needs to be more truth in advertising for the sexual revolution. It has brought freedom to no one; only bondage.Third paragraph: We get back to the real question don't we? What is it ? If it's not human than no justification is necessary. If it is human than no justification is sufficient. About the choice, you made it when you decided to have sex. That troublesome problem of procreation again.Fourth paragraph; there is that question again; what is it? just a group of cells or a human being in the early stages of life. If it's human, it's murder. hence the parallel.Fifth paragraph: The examples you give represent a very, very small percentage of abortions. The vast majority of abortions are preformed on healthy women and children. About adoption; me and my spouse are an infertile couple, we looked into adoption and guess what? there are long waiting list for domestic adoption simply because there are more couples than children due to the fact that over 1500 abortions are performed daily in this country. that's why most couples adopt from overseas.Sixth paragraph. If perfection is your standard then yes prohibition doesn't work. Prohibition does work, that's what every law is, a prohibition. It's sounds like you are arguing again for anarchy. To that I say; truth in advertising please.Nobody is ""telling kids to have sex""Really, you just substantiated my previous claim to being numb. Sex is used to sell everything these days. Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers. If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.About the choice and sex ed. I'd rather we told the kids the true cost of premarital sex. instead of lie to them. Oh yeah little Johny you can play with fire, just follow these simple steps and you'll be just fine and hey here is some firecrackers to make it more fun. Now let me show you how to make a really cool fire using gasoline. Come on! Let's help kids choose what is best for them, and it's not broken hearts, STDs, single motherhood and the whole list of other stuff that goes along with it. About the parallel with fire, in case you didn't know, passion burns. A fire not contained can destroy a whole forest. Don't believe me. Watch the interview Dr. Dobson did with Ted Bundy the night before his execution. I'll quote it for you from memory because it's burned in there:Dr Dobson: Ted, you once were an innocent little boy. How did you get here?Ted Bundy: Pornography. I was exposed to it as little boy and it became a passion that was never satisfied. The more I got the more wanted till I was killing women to get it. Just ask any man here who is here on sexual charges and he'll tell you the same thing.About the study; I don't dispute it. Of course it's failing that's my point. It's only logical that it would if you have a million people shouting, have sex and one small voice whispering, abstain. I doubt you did your homework and looked at the numbers for teen pregnancy and STDs before and after the sexual revolution.Abstinence is fail proof. You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant. However contraception is not so. You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant. It's that simple.Final thought; if morals are relative as you claim, why are you trying to push yours on me and why should I follow yours and not mine. Is it because you think there is an objective standard that people ought to follow and a way things ought to be. But that's just your personal preference isn't. If you really believed that morality was subjective you would go sit under a tree and talk to no one, but you don't. You try and persuade people that your view is the correct one, but why I ask?"
1," Abortion is more likely to wipe out the bad than the good This argument is based on the premise that poverty and conditions conducive to crime often correlate to those that seek abortions. Stephen Levitt of Freakonomics makes this argument. He contends that the 1973 Roe. v. Wade legalization of abortions led to the fall in crime rates in the 80s and 90s across the United States. The period of declining crime, he says, correlated to the period when those that were aborted might have otherwise become criminals in society as a result of their circumstances. 
"
1,"So what then, is the ""the purpose for which it was designed"" if not procreation? Pleasure?! Say it's not so! I would say man has a nature and that it is fixed. And it is for this reason that I strongly believe in not banning abortions and I strongly believe that abstinence only education should be replaced by comprehensive sexual education. Because part of that fixed nature of man is that each of us has impulses and desires of a sexual nature. (And those impulses and desires are not wrong.) Acting upon them is not a matter of ethics or morality. I've never understood how sexual activity came under the morality umbrella to begin with. So long as it is consensual, there's no justification. We don't analyze other types of activity for their moral fiber. Do we talk about the morality of football? The morality of swimming? The morality of sleeping? Laws, as I stated earlier, should be based on the good of society, namely not causing harm to other people, while protecting each person's individual rights to do all things that do not cause harm to others. Ethics are not fixed, else we would all have identical ethical standards. How do you account for the differences if there is to be but one ideal? LoL at the sexual revolution bringing bondage. How is safe sex prior to marriage harmful to both parties, though? If you're responsible, no transmission of STD's, no unwanted pregnancies, what is the damage you speak of? As for the life expectancy of a gay man, consider this: homosexuals are 26 times more likely to die from suicide and 87 times more likely to die from murder than heterosexuals. Which says a lot about more about tolerance than it does about lifestyle. Nonetheless, your argument is moot anyway, because homosexuals do not choose to be homosexual. That's not a lifestyle choice, so it cannot be right or wrong. Would you say when you make a choice to walk barefoot you are also making the choice to host a ringworm inside of you? It's something that could be a consequence of that choice, but it's not a choice you've made. It's an effect. Similarly, impregnation is an effect of sex. Not a choice in and of itself. The choice ought to come prior to impregnation, when one can choose to prevent it through contraception. But sometimes it comes after. Nonetheless, it's up to the individual to make that choice. The examples I gave represent the reasons abortion ought to be accessible. I agree that it should not be used as birth control. I agree that we ought to reduce the number. I believe comprehensive sexual education with access to contraception is the best way to achieve that. You seem to think that just telling them not to do it and crossing our fingers is best. It's just...jaded. There are about 150,000 children up for adoption per year. I'm not sure how many adoptive couples. My point is, would adoptive couples be able to keep demand up for that many unwanted children were we to abolish abortion today? Again, let me specify. When I say ""prohibition doesn't work"" I mean prohibition of things that people recognize to be false laws. These would be laws regarding our bodies. Laws that tell us how we can use them (sex) and what we can put in them (drugs) do not work. People recognize the invalidity of these laws because they understand their bodies are ultimately theirs to do with what they please. Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers. If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.Holy cow you've got to be joking! Victimizes women?! Let me start a new debate for this alone. Please visit it at http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                       Do_magazines_victimize_women I'm all for teaching kids what's best for them. And what's best for them are the tools to make the best decisions for themselves. And those decisions, like it or not, are ultimately up to them to make. It's naiive to believe that all it will take is a strong voice repetitively shouting the abstinence mantra in order to keep people from having premarital sex. Abstinence is fail proof. You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant. However contraception is not so. You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant. It's that simple. And this is a fine way to teach sexual education. I'm not against an abstinent-leaning program, but one that does not promote healthy sexual habits at all is dangerous. We've got to take into account those who will fail to abstain. Not doing so is heartless. As far as the Ted Bundy bit goes, I really see no bearing here. That's specifically regarding pornography, which I'd be glad to debate the merits of in another debate. Final thought:Morals are relative, which is all I'm trying to push on you. My only ""push"" is that you not push legislation on others based solely on your moral beliefs."
1,"No reply!? Instead I get a downvote? On a full-page essay on the topic? That's kind of, how do you say, ah-yes, bullshit. But alas...such are the ways of CreateDebate I suppose."
2,"Well we've covered a lot of ground. Let me see if I can tie it all together for you; knowing that there is a difference between proof and persuasion.What do abortion, premarital sex, homosexuality, pornography(including soft porn, the kind found in supermarket checkout lanes) and Ted Bundy all have in common? What is the one unifying thread that ties them all together? They all devalue human life by reducing it to something less than what it is. You agree that man has a nature and it is fixed. Therefore there is a way in which mankind ought to function. A deviation from that norm is therefore dehumanizing. Let me explain.Abortion; Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.Premarital sex: views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.Homosexuality: An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you. Pornography: The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them. Soft porn: does the same as pornography but in a more subtle form; very deceiving since it appears harmless.Ted Bundy; Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of . Do you see the pattern. reduce the person to an object to be used, use the person and then discard them. At the core of everyone of these is love of self. Use other people to get what I want and when I'm done with them I move on.Does the idea of using people like objects bother you at all? It does me. That's why I oppose all these things.Final thoughts:football does have morality as do all sports, it's called the rules of the game. There's a way you play that makes it football and a way that makes it no longer football.Pragmatism is is a poor method for law since it has no way of telling what the good is. Also do a word study on the etymology of the word ethic and tell me what you come up with. Because I may be mistaken but I thought ethics (ethos) were fixed standards and morality (mores)were changing standards.Giving ones self over to passion is to be ruled by passion and no longer reason; that's bondage to be controlled by your emotions and not your mind. If homosexuals don't choose to be that way, why then can so many walk away from that lifestyle and never go back. Their high suicide rate is because of people like you who tell them they can't change when they really want to. That leads to depression and eventually suicide. That's not a very loving thing to do.On moral relativism; if that's true then it's just your personal preference and why should I like what you do. About legislation: what else do you base law on other than what you believe to be right. But why is it OK to base them on your morals and not mine?I think the state should remain neutral on sex ed. After all it is the parents responsibility, not the states. Because when the state does it, they are pushing their morality on others who don't agree with it and using my money to do it. And that is wrong.About Abortion legislation, which this debate is all about. The state has already ruled on this issue, murder is illegal and should be. Roe vs Wade simply stripped a whole class of people protection under that law and denied them rights we all enjoy. So again the question on abortion is; what is it? If it's not human, no justification is necessary. If it is human than no justification is adequate. So I say, it ain't a chicken. Humans produce humans. Therefore no reason you gave for abortion is adequate.Also I like the idea of your debate; I'll be sure to weigh in on it when I get a chance."
1,"Abortion: Gives a mother a choice in carrying a life form for 9 months and then raising it for the rest of her life. Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it. It cannot be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it. Only within a set time frame during which it has not become a person. Premarital sex: Sex that occurs before marriage. views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted. Generally I think of premarital sex as occurring within a relationship. If you're talking about casual, random sex, then your argument may hold some weight. But in the context of a relationship, there is a lot more at stake than personal pleasure via sex. Homosexuality: Sexual desire for those of the same sex. An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.  Wait....whaT? Where exactly are you getting this? Pornography: Sexual media that satisfies urges of those who cannot get laid as often as they'd like. The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them. Hustler is viewed as an object for personal pleasure to be discarded. Not the people themselves. Soft porn: Sexy people doing sexy thingsTed Bundy: Serial killer Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of .  Turned to violent sexuality (more often detective books portraying sexual violence than pornography) after an inability to relate to humanity. I'm skipping around on your other arguments because I'm not in the mood for an essay, so bear with me. Find me the ""so many"" homosexuals who can walk away from the lifestyle and never go back and I'll find you a group of people who have lied to themselves to make society happy. Laws should be based on the good of society, not on your morals. About sex ed, you're naive if you think we can leave it to the hands of the parents. You may be a responsible parent who plans to teach your children about sex, but many are not. We owe a responsibility to every child to give them the tools necessary to make the right choices when the time comes. Whether that's abstention or contraception, only they can make that choice. Alas, I think I'm a little spent on this topic. I've had this in my argument activity for weeks but I've been reluctant to write back because it's gone all over the place. If you want to debate any of the non-abortion arguments we've been discussing, let's create a new debate, because this long argument full of fifty mini-arguments is just confusing."
2,"The central theme running through your response is sex; all these issues revolve around that central theme. The question seems to be one of teleology; what is it for, how should we use it and how do we deal with it's consequences.As we, as a culture, remove the boundaries of sexual conduct and blur the distinctions it begins to have serious consequences we don't immediately recognize. The logical out working of the sexual revolution may be missed by those who advocate for it, but it is not missed by the youth. They are looking to us as adults to clue them in on how the world works and we are sending them a clear message about sex. While we sit here and debate these issues and argue that it doesn't hurt anyone and kid ourselves into thinking we are liberating ourselves; we find our children living in fear and bondage to sexual harassment at school. Girls are primarily the target and their grades suffer because of it.The sexual revolution has liberated no one; it has only dragged thousands into bondage and slowly ate away at a once great nation. You need to really think hard about the ramifications of what you are arguing for. Because you may not see the cost but that doesn't mean there isn't one.If we as a nation are to avoid going the way of the Roman Empire we need to restore the boundaries of sexual conduct. Our streets are flooded with sexual perversion because we have removed all limitations to sexual expression. The last limitation that remains is ""age of consent"" and that is being vigorously attacked. The only safe place of expression for sex is within the context of a life long heterosexual marriage. But we have told the youth otherwise; so are we surprised by the way they conduct themselves in school among classmates of the opposite sex. We don't need to be telling kids to use a condom if they want to sexually express themselves. We should be telling them that sexual expression is only appropriate within the context of a life long heterosexual marriage. Are we so foolish as a people to think that this is the first time in history a people has moved in this direction? They indeed have and the results are always devastating. Why should we think they will be any different for us.""Those who don't know history are destined to repeat it.""-Edmund Burke (1729-1797)"
1,"Ok, the central theme thing is completely unfair, considering you were the one who originally argued about porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like. I merely countered your argument. So in reality your central theme seems to be sex. I won't disagree with your argument entirely. There are certainly a number of drawbacks to the sexual revolution. Namely in terms of the feminist revolution. We've taken a number of steps backwards in some inane desire to please men. The ""playboy effect"" is a very negative behavior that has resulted from the sexual revolution. This does not mean that the sexual revolution was all bad or that sex outside of marriage is bad. It's quite a jump to say that sex is only ok in a lifelong heterosexual marriage except for religious reasons. From a religious context, sure, it makes perfect sense, but outside of that it does not. For one, ""lifelong"" partnerships sometimes don't last a lifetime. For another, people are biologically programmed to sexual desires. Sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship, and I stand by my statement that there is nothing wrong with that. Furthermore, you entirely ignored my desire to quit debating non-abortion related issues within this debate. If you'd like to debate some other topic, let's start a new debate. (please and thank you)"
2,"OK I agree about a new debate; any ideas?I do think I need to clarify something however and then I'll leave it at that.Sex with in the context of a lifelong heterosexual marriage is the ideal and proper function of sex. Any form of sexuality outside of that is dysfunctional and causes problems. As with anything when it is not used properly.I raised the issues of porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like as case studies of this principle. All of these are sexual expression outside of the proper context of sex and all of them cause problems; hence why I would classify them as dysfunctions.What does all this have to do with the abortion question? The fact that there is such a thing as this debate about abortion proves there is a problem. No problem, no debate. So here is the problem as I see it. Married couples don't have abortions. So who does then? those expressing themselves sexually outside the context of marriage. If this causes a problem (abortion) than we must say something is dysfunctional or unhealthy. We can't say it is the sexual act because that alone doesn't always cause problems. It has to be the context in which it occurs. Because sexual expression in one way is without problems and in another it causes problems. Or to put it another way; one is a healthy expression and the other is unhealthy. So to sum it all up; You will know whether something is healthy or dysfunctional by the fruit it produces. All the examples I gave including abortion are symptomatic (the fruit) of an underlying problem; sex outside it's proper context. But this does highlight a problem we in our culture suffer from. We have forgotten the principle of sowing and reaping. When you plant a tree you don't immediately get fruit, it takes time. So if we do something and don't immediately see bad results that doesn't mean there won't be any. It may take years before are actions bear fruit.So I hope you can see that I'm still debating the same issue. I'm going after the cause and not the symptom however. I also have been careful not to argue from religious reasons, although my convictions inform my reasons. So I would agree with you that people are biologically programmed to sexual desires and that sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship. But I would say, judging by the fruit, that there is a healthy and unhealthy expression of that sexuality. Maybe we could debate whether or not sex outside of marriage is unhealthy by looking at the fruit it produces."
2,you're not arguing that abstinence doesn't provides 100% protection are you?
1,"it is 100%but that is just the first stephow does one implement abstinence upon any societyhow would you do it in Americawould yah say ""just say 'no' """
1,You lead by setting a higher standard. That's what leaders do; take people were the don't want to go. It takes no leadership on my part to get the family to go to Disneyland. It does how ever to get them to save through out the year so at Christmas time they have something to give to those less fortunate.
2," It is wrong to consider abortion a tool in crime prevention  Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt, from the essay Where Have All the Criminals Gone? Want to understand what made the crime rate drop in the 1990s? Look back to the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 - ""To discover that abortion was one of the greatest crime-lowering factors in American history is, needless to say, jarring. It feels less Darwinian than Swiftian; it calls to mind a long ago dart attributed to G. K. Chesterton: when there aren’t enough hats to go around, the problem isn’t solved by lopping off some heads. The crime drop was, in the language of economists, an 'unintended benefit' of legalized abortion. But one need not oppose abortion on moral or religious grounds to feel shaken by the notion of a private sadness being converted into a public good.""[34]
"
1,"Actually, depending on what is allowed in ""abstinence"", it may not. Oral sex, for instance, can transmit STD's, and many abstinent teens turn to oral sex as a way to satisfy their sexual desires. I'm arguing that sexual desires are natural. It's easy to succumb to those desires and so abstinence-only education is weak. It ignores the fact that some people will CHOOSE not to remain abstinent. And that these people deserve facts on having safe sex. And furthermore, that if we made contraception more widely available to those who choose not to be abstinent, we can drastically cut down on the numbers of abortions."
2,"Abstinence means to abstain. You can't get pregnant if you're not having sex and STDs are called that because they are sexually transmitted; no sex, no transmission.About desire, we all got them and we all have an assortment of them. The difference between children and adults is that adults learn to control them. Children act on every desire; if adults did that, society would not be possible. So what I hear you saying is that we should never grow up. Hey kids will be kids, right? Come on. Let's raise the bar and actually expect kids to grow up.Also, giving condoms is giving permission. You may be self deluded, but the kids get the message loud and clear. Sex outside of marriage goes through the roof with this approach and so does all the other problems associated with it. What I hear you saying is that it's best to create 100 problems to solve 1 problem. I'm sorry but that's what I call moral confusion.Final thought, Kids rise to the occasion when you challenge them. Yes, some will fail. But better to loose a 100 than 10000. And the converse is also true. Set a low standard and kids will meet it. That's because they are looking to adults for guidance. So, lets expect more out of kids and not less."
2,yes - i agree that abstinence is 100% absolute protection but i still await your explanation of how you would enforce such a policy
1,"You don't nor should you. The government should remain neutral on this issue. It's the parent's responsibility, not the state's. We need to get sex ed out of public schools and give the choice of sex ed back to the parents were it belongs. And may the best idea win."
1,"Not if you get raped, no.............................................."
1,"attn Jstabtall:do you live in some kinda warped universe""Abstinence is the only practice that provides 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy, nothing else comes close.""can you show me a culture or a time in human history where society has instituted functional, workable, effective abstinence policyyes - your proposal works in an ideal world were everyone has exactly the same thoughts and actions but that world does NOT exist"
2,"Yes, I do. that's the problem. Why not strive for the ideal instead of settle for something less."
1,"""Over the past decade, the US federal government has heavily promoted programs that advocate sexual abstinence as the key strategy for dealing with adolescent sexuality, but studies are demonstrating that the approach has little impact on teen sexual behavior or in preventing pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)"""
2,"Guess it depends on who's study you read and how they ask the questions. The CDC tells a different story. STD means sexually transmitted and if your not having sex (any kind of sexual contact) you're not transmitting; It's that simple. Ask the CDC what they do in an outbreak, quarantine. Why do hospitals not allow children visitors during flu season? Why are you advised to stay at home when sick? Please tell me why this approach works for all diseases except sexually transmitted ones?"
1,"No, of course abortions should not be banned for you would have them anyway regardless of safety, funding or anything else that might get in the way. We would be back in the days of the butcher shops and that wouldn't be good for anyone. Abortion is not a trivial matter and is one that must be thought out thoroughly by the person or persons involved. I wouldn't like to see us take such a serious step lightly nor would I like to see us take a step backwards in time."
1,"Poor women are disproportionately deprived choice when abortion is illegal. Poor woman are most susceptible to circumstances in which abortion is necessary. If abortion is illegal, therefore, this socio-economic group will be disproportionately affected.  
"
2,"So you would say that it is better that 45 million + children die through abortion than a handful of women through a botched abortion. That doesn't sound like progress to me: That sounds like serious moral confusion. Go check out the stats on abortion rates through out the years and you will see a staggering peak after Roe vs Wade.And yes, we would still have abortions, they would just be a whole lot fewer of them. Again, check out the stats on abortion rates before and after Roe vs Wade."
2,"This is flawed logic. By your logic nothing should be illegal because people do it anyway. Why make cocain illegal, people do it anyway?"
2,I understand what you mean and perhaps I should have worded it differently but I remember the times before Roe v. Wade where women would have abotions regardless of peril to their own lives! That's what I meant.
1,"interesting that in the eight years of Bush and the years of Republican controlled Congress and era of conservative judges that th 1973 Roe versus Wad has not been overturnedalthough they claim to be Christian fundamentalist, they too have a use for abortions ... it not just Democrats that go to Planned Parenthood and private doctors for pregnancy terminations"
1,"Abortion is aw right that should be based solely on the woman's decision. There is no reason for abortion to be banned, and in fact, that is restricting the rights of women by not allowing them to have abortions. Also, think of those who have been raped and sexually abused and have no choice but to bear the child of a person who did such horrible things to them. An abortion is the only way to escape raising something that would always remind that person of something horrible in their life."
2,"So the woman's decision means killing a child, and that should be ok?How is the fact that the child was conceived through rape, the childs fault? Would you treat this child different after it was born? So, why treat it any different before?Finally, abortion is NOT the only way to escape raising a child that would remind that person of something horrible. They can put the child up for adoption. There are thousands of families waiting."
1,"No, wit does not mean killing a child. It means killing a zygote that has no conscious thought. Arguments against abortion use scare tactics like killing cute babies in their mother's arms. This is not what abortion is. Abortion is an escape route for people who have no other choice but to not have a baby. You Kamranw forget the situation of the mother's death. Also, yes a child that was born because of a traumatic indecent such as rape would be treated differently. Also, what about the mother's career or in some cases the mother's education. Should that be ruined because of the inability for this escape."
2,"Help me with something here, are you saying that a career and education are more important than the life of a child? Also, were you ever a zygote that had no conscious though? Than you would have to agree that if your mother had an abortion it would've killed you, not something else, but you. Aren't you glad your mother put your life before hers?"
2,"A mothers career should be a factor in a childs life? And yes, it is a life. You were once under 10 weeks old in your mothers womb as well. Let me rephrase, would you justify a child being treated poorly and judged differently because their mother was raped?"
2,If you go to your local crisis pregnancy center and ask about adoption they will provide information and if you choose adoption they will lead you through the process.

2,"After a woman has an abortion, her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief. Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years —5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual. Guilt, regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, dreams and nightmares, flash-backs, anniversary reactions, hostility toward men, crying, despair, and even suicide attempts are symptoms of Post-Abortion Syndrome. Many women turn to drugs and alcohol as a way of masking the pain. Anniversary reactions are an increase in symptoms around the time of the anniversary of the abortion, the due date of the aborted child, or both."
2,Again I must say that only 1% of all abortions are performed because the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Women rarely become pregnant if they are raped.
1,"As much as I'm against it and think what a horrible feeling and decision that must be for the women, abortion should not be banned altogether. We would go back to the dark ages where doctors and their patients would have ""back alley abortions"". 3rd trimester should be illegal that's just wrong. It is a very hard topic that I struggle with. Ultimately the choice lies within the women. But what a awful one to make, they will live with it for the rest of their life."
1,"Abortion should not be banned. Pregnant women would still find a way to abort children, and thereby risk dangerous methods, or suspect ""doctors"", as seen in other countries. Freedom entitles you to do whatever you want with your body, and by that I mean until a new human is complete."
2,Only 1% of all abortions in the United States are a result of rape or incest.
2,Even if you were raped it still the killing of a living human being...still wrong.

1,"Abortion might forestall the potential birth of another Hitler. This is a counter-argument to the notion that abortion could have wiped out some of the greatest social contributors in history; it also could have wiped out some of the worst individuals in history.

2,"The standard process of partial birth abortion is an unnecessarily violent process that breaks from the normative treatment of life forms. The procedure involves sticking a pair of scissors into a baby’s brain, enlarging the hole, sucking the brain out with a catheter and then crushing the skull. This is a violent procedure that involves a substantial degree of destructiveness, which many believe to be excessive and and grotesque. Even if the ""killing"" of the fetus were to be justified, many argue that the means of doing so could be more ""civilized"" and less violently destructive. A process that simply involved the piercing of the brain, but not the removal of the brain and crushing of the skull, for example, could be argued as less destructive and thus more ""civilized"". 
"
2,"If it is countered that this analogy is not appropriate because fetuses should not be considered on an equal basis as those subject to capital punishment, a number of considerations should be made against this position. First, those that are subject to capital punishment are often murderers or extreme offenders. Should these citizens be regarded more highly, and more worthy of decency than an unborn fetus? Maybe not. 
First, an unborn fetus has often taken on most aspects of human form, nearing ""viability"", meaning that it shares most of the human characteristics held by a fully grown human criminal. 
Second, both an unborn fetus and a convicted criminal share the fact that they lack the full rights assigned to regular citizens. 
On this basis, it may be appropriate to conclude that a unborn fetus and a convicted death-row criminal should be treated with a similar level of decency. Given that most liberal democracies prohibit violent forms of capital punishment, it may then follow that liberal democracies (and others) should prohibit the common methods of partial birth abortions on the grounds that they are excessively violent.

2," The unborn are voiceless and should be protected against abortion Ronald Reagan. New York Times. September 22nd. 1980 - ""I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.""[4] In other words, the unborn would all be against abortion, but, of course, they can't express their opinion as for/against abortion. It is important to protect such a voiceless minority in society.
"
1,"The collapsing of the skull of the ""partially born"" fetus is necessary to prevent pain and the risk of damage to the woman. The head is the largest single part of a fetus, and is the most difficult to pass. Similar to giving birth, the passing of the head often causes excruciating pain, struggle, and sometimes damage to the Cervix and Vagina. Collapsing the skull eliminates these risks. As such, it can be argued that the collapsing of the skull of the unborn head of the fetus is a ""civilized"" measure in the way that it protects the mother from harm or the risk of harm. In other words, the infliction of pain and destruction on the fetus may be canceled out by the reduction in the pain and risk of permanent damage to the woman. 
It is also arguable that it is the women's right to protect herself from the pain alone, irrespective of whether there are any serious long-term health risks that might result from passing the intact head of an unborn child. 
"
1,"A ban on partial birth abortions would stop other even more ""gruesome"" forms of late term abortions. The primary alternative to partial birth abortion is the dismemberment and removal, in parts (legs, arms, head, torso), of an unborn fetus while inside the mother's womb. This may be more ""gruesome"" than a partial birth abortion. A ban on partial birth abortion would not eliminate this primary alternative to partial birth abortion. Neither would it necessarily reduce the number of overall late term abortions being performed. This only goes toward pointing out that a partial birth abortion ban, in isolation, would not necessarily reduce the ""gruesomeness"" of the late term abortion procedures being performed.

"
2,"Banning partial birth abortion does not eliminate a woman's right to choose methods to prevent their impregnation or abort at an earlier stage. There are dozens of forms of birth control, pregnancy detection, and early-term abortion options that women have the ""right"" to choose from that can prevent the need or desire to have a late term abortion such as partial birth abortion.
"
2,"The widespread availability of birth control options provide women with a sufficient ""choice"" to determine the future of their bodies. The options include, abstinence, condom and profalactics, birth-control pills, morning-after or plan B pills. If a woman does not want to get pregnant, she is free to choose these options of birth control, which - if used responsibly - have a high probability of preventing impregnation (Abstinence is 100% effective). Therefore, unintentional impregnation has a high correlation with the irresponsible or even negligent use or avoidance of birth control methods. As such, women are provided the right to choose to act responsibly in protecting their bodies from impregnation in the first place. Therefore, a ban on partial birth abortion may not deprive women of the right choose to take the initial, responsible steps in protecting against uninented impregnation. This may be a sufficient provision to women of the ""right to choose"" to adopt measures that will help them control the future of their bodies. Any additional provisions, such as partial birth abortion, may be redundant and excessive. 
"
2,"Pregnancy detection methods and first term abortion options may also be sufficient provisions to women of the means to ""choose"" to determine the future of their bodies. If the above prevention methods fail, there are many other means made widely available to women, which can enable them to determine that they are pregnant in the first trimester. As such, these measures may provide women with sufficient means to make a responsible ""choice"" to abort in the first trimester, instead of opting for a late-term abortion such as a partial birth abortion. It is arguable that a government should not be responsible for providing additional measures to a woman, and that any woman that misses these provisions has acted irresponsibly or negligently, and subsequently may not deserve further, later options, such as partial birth abortion.

This basic slippery slope argument, in other words, indicates that abortion would have to either be always illegal or always legal, because all other intermediate laws would risk being arbitrary, and be incapable of permanency. Pro-choice advocates believe that the women's ""right"" to their own body is most important to preserve, and thus that it is best to fall on the side of extending full choice to the mother, and preserving the ""right"" to partial birth abortion.

1,"There are certain exceptional cases which have been cited as circumstantially appropriate for a partial birth abortion. 
Mother and/or family are impoverished and would not be able to support the new family entrant. One of the most common reasons why a poor woman seeks an abortion is that ""she can not take care of herself and the children she has. Most of the pregnant women helped by the Women's Medical Fund have children—many with two or three, some with as many as 10. Another birth will draw the family deeper into poverty."" 
This argument may equally apply to partial birth abortion. Even if it becomes increasingly ""wrong"" to kill a more and more developed fetus, a partial birth abortion may nevertheless be justified on the basis that the benefits (or foregone pain) to the larger family unit outweighs the costs (or pain and lost life opportunity) to the single fetus. 
A poor woman may also be more susceptible to late abortions for a variety of reasons. Poverty may decrease the availability of certain resources that make it possible for a woman to ""choose"" to prevent impregnation, discover that she is pregnant, and or seek a first term abortion. This might make it unreasonable to deny poor women the ability to seek third-term partial birth abortions. The following is a list of the conditions that may make a poor woman unable to ""choose"" anything but a late, partial birth abortion. She may lack:
Access to condoms and other birth control resources:
Access to pregnancy testing kits.
Access to information which would make it clear that she is eligible to seek an abortion, and where and how to do so.


Homeless women:
Women may seek to abort having the child of a batterer. A common reason for seeking abortions is that a woman is battered by her husband or boyfriend, and does not want to bear the child of the batterer. A scenario can arise that may go specifically toward justifying a partial birth abortion, in which a woman begins to be battered only late into her pregnancy, when a partial birth abortion is one of the only options. In this case, while she may have been perfectly reasonable in seeking to become pregnant, the reasons for having a baby (ie starting a family) would have changed as the abuse began and as the appropriateness of starting a family fades away. As such, such a victim may be justified in pursuing a late, partial birth abortion.
Responding to rape, a woman seeks and abortion. Impregnation from rape is one of the most commonly cited justifications for abortion, as the impregnation was completely involuntary on the part of the mother. Justifying partial birth abortions in these instances is largely an issue of timing. The main question is whether it is reasonable to expect that all woman act immediately upon their rape and impregnation by pursuing an abortion in the first term? It may be unreasonable, and a late, partial birth abortion may be appropriate, for the following reasons:
Female rape victims may be physically prevented by the rapist from seeking an abortion in the first term. Some rape victims are sex slaves or kidnapped against their will. If only became possible for them to perform an abortion in the second or third term with a partial birth abortion, should they be deprived the right to do so? Having had no ""choice"" in the matter up to this point, it may be appropriate to extend the ""choice"" to abort with a partial birth abortion in such circumstances. 
Impregnated rape victims may be deterred from seeking an abortion at an early stage out of fear of reprisal from the rapist.

On an issue where great life-changing impact can occur from singular mistakes, and particularly when these mistakes are frequently made during an immature emotional period in a woman's life, it may be important for society to provide women with the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to make major decisions throughout their pregnancy.

2,"Discussions of quickening or ensouling addressed the issue of when the soul entered the unborn child.  Saint Augustine, without the aid of sonograms or the advances in embryology we have today, calculated that boys received their souls at 40 days after conception, girls at 90 days (apparently Speaker Pelosi's analysis of Augustine missed this point).  However, the Church always viewed abortion as a great evil at any stage of pregnancy.  Modern embryology now confirms what the Church knew all along --life begins at conception.  That is a scientific fact, not a religious belief.  At the moment of conception a human life has been created.  That life may end before birth through miscarriage or abortion, but it was a human life.  With regard to war, adultery and other types of sin, abortion and euthanasia are on their own level in relation to other transgressions.  The intentional taking of innocent lives can never be approved by the Church. "
1,"""Modern embryology now confirms what the Church knew all along --life begins at conception""This seems wrong on both counts. The Church did not know this all along, or they wouldn't have had the whole quickening thing. Second, sperm and eggs are living. The sperm is alive before conception so there is no ""beginning"" of life from non-life occurring. One could easily interpret the Bible in such away to believe that sperm and eggs have the same rights as fertilized eggs. After all, it's all based on the passage that God knew us before we were born.""The intentional taking of innocent lives can never be approved by the Church.""So a Catholic couldn't vote for McCain either? He intentionally supported a war that the Pope has said is immoral, illegal, and a threat to humanity.

Human life does not begin until the two come together.I have searched the Vatican website and have found no statement by either Pope John Paul II or Pope Benedict XVI that the war in Iraq is ""immoral, illegal, and a threat to humanity.""  That is not surprising in light of the fact that no such statement was ever made.John Paul II stated as his own personal opinion, and expressly not as Church doctrine, that he did not believe the invasion of Iraq was justified.  The Church itself long ago developed the Just War theory because it acknowledged that under certain circumstances wars might have to be fought.  Reasonable people could disagree as to when those circumstances existed, and Catholics have disagreed about the Iraq War.  However, the Church has never stated as a matter of doctrine that the War in Iraq was not a Just War.The Church, through its teaching authority, talks about a hierarchy of sins.  Since we are talking about abortion and war, lets look at some numbers.  Since Roe v. Wade was decided 35 years ago, there have been approximately 50 million abortions in the United States alone.

An estimate of between 25 to 50% of fertilized eggs are spontaneously aborted.The figures on that are a guess because they happen before most women even know they are pregnant and don't usually get pregnancy tests done. Of the known pregnancies, about 10% are naturally aborted. How does that figure into the wonders of religion?"

1,"to make a point of logical consistency. We all would be better off helping make sure that we educate people about sex and pregnancy so that we could reduce the numbers of unplanned pregnancies. But that would require us to teach our children about sex and contraceptives. It sometimes seems that people would like a particular result without being active in the solution. I also admit I was taking a dig at the religious belief that god considers every life special. It can hardly be true if god created a body which naturally aborts more often than others induce them. I agree taking other ""innocent "" human lives is wrong and that natural disasters are a terrible experience for all those involved. I try not to resort to worse case scenarios. I happen to think a woman or young girl is higher on the list of people who need support than a few cells starting to become a life and have a hard time understanding the religious point of view on   abortion  .It always appears to me that people know god's mind and I wonder how they know it. Did they ever think that god had a different plan for that woman of young girl other than raising a child? It seems to me if you are going to use the argument god works in mysterious ways you would have to conclude that among one of the mysterious ways he chose, abortion would be among those ways.If one proceeds along those lines, even as a Christian, you have to say that yes, a Christian  could vote for a pro choice candidate because technically speaking no one knows the ways of god and god may not be that opinionated on the subject."
2,All women everywhere must be give choice - of whether to have unprotected sex or not.  If a fetus is killed by an attack on a pregnant woman it is considered murder.  Obviously the same must apply in the case of willful abortion unless there are medical problems.Why do liberals insist on choice prior to birth but refuse parents the choice of schools once the child is born?  
1," Women must control their bodies or risk becoming servants of the fetus Forcing a woman to continue an unwanted pregnancy subjugates a woman to the fetus. Under no circumstances should a woman's right to control her own body be curtailed in this way. Or, in other words, a fetus cannot be said to have rights to a woman's body that enslave the woman and her body in the relationship. This argument is encapsulated in what is known as the ""dialysis analogy"", put forward by Judith Jarvis in ""A defense of abortion"". The argument is that, an individual that hypothetically lives off of another woman's body does not have a right to continue to utilize that woman's body as a kind of ""dialysis machine"". The woman has a right to ""unplug"". In the same sense, a woman has the right to ""unplug"" her body from the fetus, which depends on the woman's body to live, but which does not have rights over the woman's body for its continued existence.

Well then, that pretty well narrows it down a bit.Throughout the ages mankind has fought against good and evil.  Placing both at the forefront of the battle from which gain members.To do evil is relitively easy.  To do Good on the other hand, well now, thats another story, but it's one with a happy ending I assure you.Religion has been with man from the beginning and man himself and by himself can not seem to agree when that happened either.  That's another story.For the most part, a mans religion has been a mans reason for living, for doing good deeds and for spiritual gratification.  An inner growth in sorts.  Man who becomes bored with doing good things will tend to drift toward a more distorted belief.  An inward or selfward belief.  One which promises nothing and will in the end, do much the same.  This same man or individual will challenge any and all things that block his ability to waiver from the Truth.  Much like an adolesent who so chooses to misbehave in the face of a supperior.  He'll take on the Empire State Building, making claims to substantiate his opinion and stope low in order to win his point.  A kind of sinister high, if you will.  He's taken on authority from all corners of the world and when that wasn't challenging enough, he decided to take on God.  Thinking so highly of himself, he couldn't see the forrest for the trees.  We've seen this play out before and within the Catholic Church when certain individuals decided to place themselves above God.  Most recently, this created a break in the Church with false promises to those wanting more, so called freedom from the teachings of the Church.Of course like many people do, they decided to leave and start their own church with their own way of doing things and with their own beliefs, interpreted in their own way.  Even today, within the Catholic Church, there are those who call themselves Catholic but hold their own personal views and opinions, far from the True Churchs Doctrin which has been handed down from the beginning.  The Teachings have not changed, though the people have.  It is one Teaching, that from God, which protects the Catholic Church, the one Jesus started some two thousand years ago.  Over 33,000 new and improved churchs have popped up since the 1500's and continue to promise everything but the entire Truth.  Those who wish to argue this can simply research it for themselves.  I didn't make it up, I simply am providing you an extended version of why this topic can not be debated upon as though it were an opinon for cooking pizza.  Oh it can I guess, but then you would be choosing to be on the right side or the wrong side.  So proceed with caution.  Somebodies life other than your own, might well depend on it.A Pro-Choice Politician is just another individual who wants a vote.  A True-Catholic cannot vote for an intrensic evil unless the options available provide a better result which would be supportive to Gods point of view which supports all life.  Society today has watered down Truth as to it's true meaning from years ago.  Today Truth still exist and it's a wonderful thing to have in a confused world.  Like many topics, instead of trying to dissect our world into more suitable bites, can we not simply list all that is Good and all that is Bad, like too opposing teams and let the players decide for themselves?  But then again, you would have to allow an oppertunity for the Truth to be known.  "

There is not a unanimous tradition on this point and authors are as yet in disagreement. For some it dates from the first instant; for others it could not at least precede nidation. It is not within the competence of science to decide between these views, because the existence of an immortal soul is not a question in its field. It is a philosophical problem from which our moral affirmation remains independent for two reasons: (1) supposing a belated animation, there is still nothing less than a human life, preparing for and calling for a soul in which the nature received from parents is completed, (2) on the other hand, it suffices that this presence of the soul be probable (and one can never prove the contrary) in order that the taking of life involve accepting the risk of killing a man, not only waiting for, but already in possession of his soul.A Catholic who may think that there is room in Catholic theology for the ""acceptance of policies that favor access to the full range of ""reproductive health options"", (on the contrary, are not healthy emotionally, physically or spiritually) you only need to read what the Church herself teaches on abortion and contraception.

2,"Nowadays,Catholics can do whatever they wish in good conscience.  At least this is what they choose to believe.  This is not what the Catholic Church, established 2009 years ago, believes or teaches, however.  The rules were set down by the author of life and death, and to my knowledge, they are still in force.  Jiminy Cricket misled many of us, and we need to forget that little bug's   teaching   about 'always let your conscience be your guide.'  Our conscience can mislead us.  It's wise to always let the Catechism of the Catholic Church be our guide if we care about pleasing our Lord and preserving our immortal souls.  And certainly, don't let the current   society   trends be our guide.  That's just plain foolish.  Try to imagine how many trends have come and gone in 2009 years.  What if the Church made silly changes to accomodate these trends every time one came along?  Be thankful the Church stands firm on God's laws and obey them.  Enjoy the treasures of the Church.  We have them in abundance.  Pray for all our brothers and sisters of other faiths.  We are all one family in His eyes."

2,"When the Pope speaks definitively on fiath and morals, it is infallible.  Many things have been declared infallible since 1870.  The teaching barring birth control is one example. It was definitively declared by Pope Paul VI in the encyclical Humanae Vitae, which was written specifically for that purpose.  Pope John Paul II wrote the encyclical Evangelium Vitae for a similar purpose--the bishops had asked him to clarify/codify Catholic teaching regarding life issues such as abortion and euthanasia.  The Church's anti-abortion stance was also clearly published in the Catechism of the Catholic Church which is approved and released by the Vatican undr the direction of Pope John Paul II to clearly lay out that which the Chiurch considers to be core Catholic teachings.  The Church's teaching against abortion is indeed infallible.  You are correct in your understanding of what constitutes an infallible statement in regard to codifying as doctrine matters of traditional belief, such as the Assumption of Mary.  But definitive statements from the Pope in regard to issues of faith and morals also morally obligate all Catholics and are both infallible and unchangable."
2,"In your reasoning you have stated that “a human being must always obey the certain judgment of his conscience.” You also said that when the church cannot speak definitively on a matter, ""the consciences of individual Catholics must be primary and respected. This leaves latitude for Catholics to support prochoice politicians.""Your reasoning is flawed for two reasons:The church has taught on a matter of faith and morals that   abortion   is a grave and mortal sin.  The church has also taught that supporting these policies are wrong.  Therefore the church has spoken definitely on the matter.Secondly, in your support of deferring to a person's conscience you have failed to mention what the Catechism speaks of in terms of malformed consciences.  The church clearly teaches that this ignorance, which includes defiance of church teaching, is no excuse for sins commited.  This is from CCC 1790 - 1792. I have provided an excerpt for reference: Yet it can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed.This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility. This is the case when a man ""takes little trouble to find out what is true and good, or when conscience is by degrees almost blinded through the habit of committing sin."" In such cases, the person is culpable for the evil he commits.Ignorance of Christ and his Gospel, bad example given by others, enslavement to one's passions, assertion of a mistaken notion of autonomy of conscience, rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching, lack of conversion and of charity: these can be at the source of errors of judgment in moral conduct.

1,"A fetus is not a ""person"" so can't have rights protecting it from abortion: Is terminating a fetus, which can neither feel emotions nor be conscious of its own ""existence,"" really be considered equivalent to killing a ""person?"" Some define personhood (qualifying for rights) through a set of criteria. A being need not exhibit every criterion to qualify as a person, but failure to exhibit most is proposed as disqualification. One list includes consciousness (at least the capacity to feel pain), reasoning, self motivation, the ability to communicate on many possible topics, and self-awareness. Lists like this are intended to help someone be able to objectively distinguish between a biological human and a person. An embryo is not a person because it satisfies only one criterion, namely consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain). Other sets of criteria conclude that an embryo lacks personhood (and a right to life) because it lacks self-consciousness, rationality, and autonomy. These lists diverge over precisely which features confer a right to life, but tend to propose that they are developed psychological features not found in embryos.

1," Opponents can object to abortions, but must tolerate the choice Opponents of abortion may have a strong moral case and belief against abortion. Yet, their beliefs are not shared by all. They must tolerate a woman's right to have an abortion, even if they believe the act to be morally wrong. The best that opponents can hope for is to convince women that it is immoral, but to ask for the illegalization of abortion would be to wrongly deny that abortion is a right.

2,"Mr. O'Brien appears to be attempting to muddle the definition of 'infallible teaching'.  Church teachings are declared in one of three ways:Papal 'ex cathedra' statements  -  Except for the errors stating that the declaration of infallibility itself was proclaimed via this method and the implication that it is the sole source of infallible teaching, Mr. O'Brien's characterization of this particular source of the deposit of faith is correct.  (The dogma of papal infallibility was declared via the Extraordinary Universal Magisterium, specifically from the First Vatican Ecumenical Council - 1870.)Extraordinary Universal Magisterium - Bishops united with the Pope at an Ecumenical Council.  An infallible example here would be the dogma of Christ's Divinity.  (First Nicea Council – 325)Ordinary Universal Magisterium – Bishops dispersed throughout the world and united with the Pope being in agreement on one judgment or position to be definitively held.  An infallible example here would be the reality of angels and demons as creatures of intellect and will.Mr. O'Brien's assertion of a doctrine of primacy of personal conscience also selectively cites a partial portion of the Church teaching regarding conscience.  Consider also paragraph 1783 of the Catechism which includes:“The education of conscience is indispensable for human beings who are subjected to negative influences and tempted by sin to prefer their own judgment and to reject authoritative teachings.”Although the Magisterium has a plethora of statements that are definitive authoritative teachings of the Church doctrine regarding the grave sin of abortion, perhaps the most succinct is from Pope John Paul II in Evangelium Vitae who quotes Vatican II documents Lumen Gentium & Gaudium et Spes as well as Pope Paul VI's Humanae Vitae:“By the authority which Christ conferred upon Peter and his successors, in communion with the bishops – who on various occasions have condemned abortion and who in the aforementioned consultation, albeit dispersed throughout the world, have shown unanimous agreement concerning this doctrine – I declare that direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, always constitutes a grave moral disorder, since it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being.  This doctrine is based upon the natural law and upon the written Word of God, is transmitted by the Church's tradition and taught by the ordinary and universal magisterium.”"
2,"Have we not read our Popes' encyclicals?  Pope John Paul II wrtoe the encyclical Evangelium Vitae specifically for the purpose of defining the Church's teaching on life issues such as abortion and euthanasia.

2,"You state that ""At the end of the day, the bishops remind us, individual Catholic voters must use their own “prudential judgment” – or, moral common sense – when deciding which levers to pull. If after examining the facts, a Catholic truly believes that a “pro-choice” candidate will do more to promote the cause of human life than one who seeks legal prohibitions on abortion, her or she can vote for the pro-choice candidate with a clear conscience.""My question to Catholics out there is this: Are we examining the facts? If one candidate's record is more pro-life than the other (OnTheIssues.org is very helpful) how can a Catholic truly believe that a pro-choice candidate will do more to promote the cause of human life if his record is the opposite of pro-life in every sense of the word? Catholic or not, to ignore the facts, or worse, to have life issues at the bottom of your priority list, how can anyone vote with a clear conscience when defenseless babies being killed take bottom priority over the economy? If we can't trust the president to protect the most defenseless and innocent, what can we trust him with? Bottom Line: Can Catholics Vote Pro Choice? The answer is no. "

We need to provide at least basic   health care  . All people should have roofs over there head. There should be a minimum standard that all people should be provided. However, people need to give back as they can (not a welfare world).Torture is part of the middle ground. One thing that needs to be cleared up is at point do you cross the line between   interrogation   and torture? Is interrogation allowed? Is the line different for times of war and peace? Does Iraq or Afghanistan qualify as a war? Some Police forces have been accused of using torture, how do handle them?Abortion takes over a million lives every year (just in the USA); how many have died from torture?In the ""war"" do you just look at the number of American soldiers that have died, or the total number of persons that have died? Do we weigh the lives saved against the lives lost? The number of bodies found in the mass graves in Iraq has exceeded the estimates of how many people Saddam Hussein was thought to have executed.You use the term ""full fledged human being"". Please define this term. At what point does a person no longer rate ""full fledged""? If I get into a car accident and can no longer take care of myself, would I no longer be ""full fledged""?You did not mention the   death penalty  . This should only be allowed if needed to protect   society  . If a person can be kept isolated from society, then the value of their life needs to be respected. If the person can not be isolated from society, then the value of the many lives in society needs to have greater   weight   than the one person’s life.Abortion kills a known number of persons, while torture and war death tolls do not come close in quantity.

2,"In the abstract, it is morally permissible to vote for a pro-abortion candidate. Just as in the abstract, capital punishment is morally permissible when there exists no other option to protect society. In reality, the abstract conditions that would make either voting for a pro-abortion candidate or utilizing capital punishment rarely exist. Unlike capital punishment, abortion is always wrong and is a non-negotiable principle.Pope Benedict XVI is using the established moral reasoning prinicple of cooperation with evil to make his statement. Let us rigorously apply this principle to evaluate the current election:I want to evaluate the action of voting for a pro-abortion candidate, specifically Obama, using the principles of cooperation with evil.Let me first state my premises: Abortion is an intrinsic evil. It is never justified. It cannot be tolerated. Barack Obama supports abortion as is evidenced by his past senate votes and 100% NARAL rating, his endorsement by Planned Parenthood, and his promise to sign the radical Freedom Of Choice Act as one of his first official acts as president. An astute and very precise legal analysis of the dire ramifications of the Freedom of Choice Act can be found here. (   http://mirrorofjustice.blogs.com/mirrorofjustice/2008/10/a-focus-on-foca.html    ) It can also be assumed that Obama will support US funding of abortions as part of foreign aid packages as well as the performance of abortions on military installations. In addition, it can be assumed that he will appoint Supreme Court justices who are sympathetic to Roe v Wade (in spite of the fact that many legal minds have denounced the legal thinking of this ruling). Therefore, the election of Barack Obama will cause the increased vulnerability to abortion of the unborn on a world-wide basis. This is an intrinsic evil.The question is whether or not it is morally licit to vote for Barack Obama. The first step is to decide if a vote for Barack Obama is formal or material cooperation with the intrinsic evil of abortion. If one is voting for Obama specifically because he supports abortion it is formal cooperation. Formal cooperation with an intrinsic evil is always morally illicit. That was easy.What if you oppose abortion? Does electing Barack Obama contribute an essential component to the increased vulnerability to abortion of the unborn on a world-wide basis even though that is not your intent? I suggest it does, because not electing him would make this dramatic increased vulnerability impossible. This would make your cooperation immediate material cooperation. Immediate material cooperation with an intrinsic evil is also morally illicit.Let’s just say for the sake of argument, that electing Barack Obama is not an essential requirement for the increased vulnerability to abortion of the unborn. Though this will be the result of Barack Obama’s election, the voter does not intend this result. Therefore, such cooperation by electing Barack Obama would be considered mediate material cooperation. Such cooperation can only be tolerated if all four of the following conditions exist:1.    the cooperators act (voting for Obama) is itself morally good or indifferent2.    the cooperator does not intend the evil (making the unborn more vulnerable to abortion) of the principle agent (Obama)3.    the good effect is not achieved by means of the evil4.    the good effect is proportionate to the bad effectIt is condition 4 that makes the cooperation (voting for Obama) morally illicit. There is no proportionate reason to tolerate the increased vulnerability to abortion. You can see a very long list here (    http://www.wf-f.org/Bishops_Catholics_Politics2008-Present.html    of all the bishops )who have spoken to this.Therefore, using well-established principles of moral reasoning, I can confidently say it is morally illicit to vote for Barack Obama."
1,"speaking specifically of Obama can only make sense when compared to the other option. Why is it that pro-life seems to only value the life of the unborn and not the born? Can a catholic vote for someone who authorized torture if they ""value life""? What about someone who supports unnecessary wars? "
2,"You are correct in pointing out that the pro-life ethic must take into account the full spectrum.  However, you can not equate issues of the quality of life (poverty, hunger, torture) with issues of life itself (abortion, euthanasia).  Yes, we do fight against torture because it is bad.  But all issues are not equal.  Some issues are life and death issues.  We value the life - both of the born and unborn.  However, when given a person who is being tortured, a person who is homeless, and a person who is going to be killed - my priorities, my biggest fight, is going to be for the person about to be killed.  This does not mean the others are going to be ignored, but is a basic understanding that not everything is equal.  Voting for a candidate is not a full endorsement of their entire platform.  It is a vote for the best candidate.  This does not mean they are perfect, and I don't know if such a candidate has ever existed.  We must vote for the candidate who ""values life"" the most, and when comparing someone who endorses murder (aka abortion) on demand, the choice is fairly easy."
2,"Let's apply Mr. Korzen's ""do more to promote the cause of human life"" standard to a President Obama and see how that works out.President Obama will receive the Freedom of Choice Act from a Congress dominated by Democrats soon after taking office and will happily sign it.  Federal funding would be used for abortions here and overseas and parents would be deprived of notification of, or consent to, their underage daughters having abortions.  The number of abortions will obviously increase.  Any argument to the contrary is delusional.Some Catholics for Obama try to excuse their vote by claiming Obama will do more to help the poor, which is clearly a goal of Catholic Social Justice.  However, reasonable people can disagree about which candidates' policies will do more to help the poor. What cannot be disputed is that it does not promote the cause of poor people to encourage them to destroy their unborn children through federal funding of abortion or deprive them of the right to know that their underage daughter wants to have an abortion.  Such a result cannot be in accord with the Church's goal of promoting human life."
2,"The statement issued yesterday by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is available at usccb.org, expressly rejects Mr. Korzen's argument that as long as we think that a candidate will help the poor, we can ignore the candidate's appalling record on abortion.The Bishop's statement makes clear that Catholics must try to help the poor, but must always fight against the intrinsic evil of abortion.

2,"I have one simple question:If there is nothing wrong with abortion, then why do we need to reduce its use?  The Democratic Party has time and again defended not only the right to abortion, or rather the right to choose as they state, but have stated that abortion is not murder, but just another medical procedure. If this is true, then why all the work to reduce abortions?  If they truly believe that there is nothing wrong with it, what is the purpose of this new dedication to reduction?I think it is just an attempt to placate voters and appease certain members while still raking the millions of pro-abortion donor dollars and glowing endorsements from the major abortion providers and backers."
2,"You are absolutely correct that making abortion illegal is not the only option. In fact, I would argue that it must not be. If we were simply to overturn Roe v. Wade and immediately pass a no exceptions federal ban on abortions now, the results would predictably look much like the days of Prohibition with disastrous results for countless women and babies.  However, though I freely admit this point, to use this as a means of justifying continued unrestricted legal abortion is a cop out.  As Catholics, our end goal should be no more abortions.  Since we agree that simply passing legislation is not enough, then we have our work cut out for us.  First, it is important for each of us to understand that this fight is not about women's rights as the pro choice advocates claim.  Rather it is about whether or not a human life, even an unborn one, is deserving of protection as a person under the law.  To deny one group or another personhood, as Roe v. Wade does the unborn child, means they can be disposed of with impunity for any reason and by any means whatsoever.  Allowing this to continue sets a dangerous precedent by which many people may be deemed nonpersons and disposed of.  It is a person's humanity, not his utility, that should guarantee rights and protection under the law.  These are the very principles our nation was founded on.  It can be found clearly stated in the opening paragraph of the Declaration of Independence.  This said, one must also be concerned for these mothers who find themselves in desperate situations which might drive them to choose abortion. Obviously, as a nation we have failed these women.  We have not provided them adequate support.  That must change.  If we are to turn the tide against abortion, these women need compassionate support, adequate health care, and options that enable them to continue their lives in dignity without putting their child to death. Many Democrats and Republicans, pro choice and pro life activists alike, have been working to engage in these kinds of services.  However, this alone is also not enough.  So long as we deny the unborn child personhood, the unmitigated slaughter will continue, and we as a nation are guilty of grave sin. These little lives deserve the same protection as the rest of us, and it is here in the fight against abortion that we have the opportunity to guarantee the protection of law to all human beings, be they big or small, healthy or disabled, young or old.  Anything less leaves us at the whim of judges, politicians, or the popular vote to decide who lives and who should die, a breeding ground for the likes of Hitler's Germany where large groups of people were targeted because of race, religion, genetic abnormality, and even such simple things as a less desirable hair and eye color. This cannot be allowed. We protect the lives of our pets, even stray animals, but offer nothing for our own children. Though other options can and even must be pursued, abortion must be made illegal, just as it is illegal to murder, to steal from others, or to beat and torture another because you disagree with his ideas. Directly causing his death is most certainly more a violation of the child's rights than carrying the baby to term could ever be for his mother. "

2,"You are correct that prolife means all life.  HTe ideologies of both political parties falls woefully short in comparison to the whole of Catholic social justice teaching.  And while all these issues are of great importance, the right to live is the abosolute and fundamental foundation of all Catholic socail justice teaching, and as such, must take precedence over other concerns.The crux of Roe v. Wade is that it denies personhood to the unborn child.  We can argue this way and that way about when ""life"" begins.  But the truth is, regardless of faith or anything else, it is scientific fact that life begins at conception.  We can have theological debates about how and when a soul enters the body, whether we have a soul at all, etc.  But we know that all human beings begin as a single complete cell when egg and sperm unite to form a new and unique human DNA chain.  We know that this cell is alive.  It takes in nutrients and disposes of biological waste, and it immediately sets about reproducing itself in an attempt to form the human person its genetic instruction tells it to become.  This is the beginning of human life.  It is inarguable, biological fact.The question that remains before us then, is when does it constitute a person that should have protection under the law? IF you broadly interpret the intentions of our nation's founding fahters when they wrote those opening words to the Declaration of Independence, it is the moment of conception.  INdeed the Church's teachings on social justice and life issues hinges on this point: It is our humanity, not our utility or sentience, that should determine rights and protection under hte law.  And if we do not have the right to live and breathe, universal health care is an absurdity, for it cannot be universal.  The alleviation of poverty becomes moot, for those impoverished can simply be disposed of rather than fed at the crack of a gavel on a judicial bench.  The ideals of personal freedom, the right to free speech and the practice of religion become an farce, for there are those who have not been allowed to choose.  Life is the fundamental right from which all other freedoms and our dignity as human persons flows. If we do not take steps to universally guarantee it, then the only freedom we have is pure fantasy. Therfore, the protection of the right to life must take precedence over all other issues in Catholic social justice teaching, for without it, all else is meaningless."
2,"John McCain is not George Bush, and Barack Obama is not John Kerry.Obama is the most pro-abortion (yes, pro-abortion, not pro-choice, which you could concede to Senator Kerry for the sake of argument) candidate who has ever run for President.  His fervent support of the Freedom of Choice Act, along with his opposition to key provisions of the Democrats for Life sponsored Pregnant Women Support Act, clearly refute any contention that Senator Obama is pro-choice.There will be more abortions in this country if Barack Obama becomes President.  Anyone who looks past the rhetoric to Obama's actual record knows that is the truth.  Mr. Korzen and other Cahtolics like him who ignore Obama's record and vote for him in an unreasonable belief that the number of abortions will be reduced cannot claim they cast their vote in good conscience.Finally, while one can never guarantee how a Supreme Court appointee will turn out (see the abysmal Anthony Kennedy) you can be certain that a President Obama will not appoint any justice who has even the slightest chance of becoming a Roberts or Alito.  A vote for Obama is a vote for the appointment of two or three justices who will be hostile to all attempts to limit abortion for decades.

So voting based on your religious views is sillier than believing in the tooth fairy.  Let me just point out to you that Obama's plans as a whole are decidedly more in line with the ideals of Christ.   And indeed, if the whole of the Congress voted according to their Christianity which they claim to express there would be no Iraq war, nothing in Afghanistan, universal health care, free food for the homeless, shelters, and so on and so forth.  Things McCain is dead set against - as are most Republicans.  Yet giving to those who have nothing, and shunning the materialistic impulses are Christian values. Speaking of Christian values, is this why the Vatican is so rich?  Because it's money that gets you into heaven?  Or the way you vote?Or maybe it's your own individual actions....  Because the only reason you can come up as to not vote for Obama as a opposed to McCain was   abortion  .  Because that's the one issue that would help more people.  Good job.

If he came down out of the clouds and sat at the right hand of Nancy Pelosi and espoused the same views... the very same ""Christians"" sitting in congress would laugh at him.  If he wasn't shot first.    Because Christ would tell them to feed the hungry, give their coats to those who were cold, let strangers sleep in their homes - or at least their garages (?) - and to give away whatever they didn't need.   These policies are more closely matched by Obama.  So if you're going to use your ""Christian"" (as if that means anything) views to vote, why would you vote for someone whose policies are better for the richest people and crappiest for everyone else? Makes absolutely  no sense.   Yet time and time again, people will vote not for policies that more closely resemble their beliefs, but for the candidate who claims the loudest and fiercest that yes, they too, are Christian.   The ""Christain"" values that politicians profess are meaningless because you're exactly right - we can't run the world on them. The hypocrites who run things can pick and choose which so-called sins (so called because they're only sins if you're a religious type), but that doesn't mean a jellified thing.

Maybe if you're Catholic.   But it's entirely the truth, so targeting the wealth of a religion that supposed to shun it isn't hitting below the sacremental belt at all.Anywho.  "
2,"...no, they can not be Pro-Choice.The Catholic Church is very strict. According to its own self-proclaimed, self-appointed duty, it is the conduit between Man and God. It's rules - it's laws - are God's rules - God's laws. If you're truly Catholic you accept everything the Vatican says without question. It is God's word.If you call yourself Catholic and believe you can be Pro-Choice, you're delusional. I consider Catholics who believe this to have ""selective faith."" They follow the rules of the Vatican that are convenient for them, using the principles of Christianity as fire insurance. ""As long as I ask for forgiveness, I will be saved."""
1,thats not so any more
1,faithful catholic are there still any?
1,A study was done on the   voting   record of Catholics in Congress. The   pro-life   congressmen voted with the   church   against   abortion   but on nothing else. The   pro-choice   congressmen voted with the church on everything except on opposition to abortion. Now who is the good Catholic?
2,"then one needs to consider all those questions before you lay down and have unprotected sex. sexual awareness is becoming more and more prominent. on the other hand, i think that most would agree that there are extenuating circumstances. ie: rape, or if the birth itself would place the mother in danger. but, it should not be a cop out for a night of bad decisions. i also think the fathers should be given more of a choice when it comes to   abortion  . not all father's are dead beats, and some would love the opportunity. in many cases this is taken from them. it is just as emotionally traumatizing for some men. where's the fairness in that. woman don't want us telling them what they can and can't do with there body's. well, start considering the fathers a little."
1,"Upon hearing that a sexual partner of yours became pregnant and was considering   abortion  , carry the child yourself if medically possible?"
1," Abortion is the woman's choice, not the father's The Father should be told that the woman is having an abortion but until he carries and gives birth to his own baby then it is not his choice to tell the woman that she has to keep and give a painful birth to this fetus.
"
1,"A woman has the right to decide what happens inside her body.  In the end making it illegal will only punish poor woman, as wealthy woman will always have the option of having an abortion. "
1,"A human being has no moral obligation to another person to allow that person the use of what is theirs, even if that second person needs it to survive. If you disagree, I've got a really excellent proposition for you."
2,"Hi Cameron.You are using a pretty sophisticated philosophical argument first made years ago in print, by a female philosopher. A friend of mine (a University Professor of Philosophy) wrote an entire book on this and a couple of other important,   pro-choice   of   abortion  , philosophical arguments.You seem somewhat sophisticated, using the argument that you do.  Are you also a Professor of Philosophy, or an interested philosophy student, or maybe just a very bright and thoughtful individual?  Perhaps you might actually know my friend: Professor Steve Schwartz.  Cameron?  I'm not sure that I spelled his first name correctly (maybe it's ""Stephen"").  Google his name and perhaps the title of his book will also appear.I'm sorry.  I'm a little old, now; and I can't remember the title of his book just now.  It was more than a decade ago.Let me know if you can/can't find the book.  I'll try to get you plugged into it.raymond"
1,"If not, I've got nothing. You're going to have to give me a link.And I'm a poli sci student."
2,"Hi, Cameron:I googled him for page after page, and came up empty.  He's retired from URI and is working at another educational institution.I have his phone number.  I'll see what I can do."
1,So   abortion   is okay in areas where more people like it than don't? 
1,"Why do you think that slavery became a federal issue? Would you have said that the southern states were fine to continue it as long as the northern states were allowed to abolish it, and vice versa? Abortion is a federal issue, and I know that because it was ruled on by a federal court. It's a constitutional issue. States cannot simply refuse to observe the wills of the Supreme Court or the   constitution   because most of their constituents dislike them."
2,"Quote from previous commenters: ""...in 2002 alone there were 357 maternal deaths in the USA."" It is true that indeed giving birth is NOT without its risks.But successful abortion carries a 100% rate of risk of death to the child. And in contrast to the unfortunate 357 maternal deaths we see an unfortunate rate of almost 1.3 MILLION infant deaths in 2002 to abortion (    http://www.nrlc.org/ABORTION/facts/abortionstats.html    ).I suspect it is one's ego that is willing to value one life more than another... or one life more than 3,613 others.In response to ""A woman has a right over what happens inside her body,"" actually I believe what the previous commenter was trying to say was ""A woman has the right over her own body."" But science tells us that the child inside is not her body, but a completely different body and person. Common sense concludes that nobody has the right to control the life or death of another person regardless of their location, age or status (born or not)."
1,"I can only assume by your moniker that you are a male and consequently will never experiance facing an unwanted pregnancy.  Infants are not ""being killed"" because an embryo is not an infant.  Until that ""child"" can function and breath on it's own it's still considered part of the woman's body.  A woman does not give up her human o legal rights simply because she conceives.  Like I've said, unless the woman involved is your girlfriend, wife, mother, sister, ect. you have no right to tell her what to do with her body.  It's of no financial burden to you if she chooses   abortion  .  It's of no concern to you if she chooses abortion.  The woman is a stranger to you.  You have no knowledge of her financial or emotional circumstances.  It's none of your business unless you plan on supporting the child for the next 18 years of it's life."
2,"I've been pregnant 5 times, if that means that I am uniquely more qualified than a man to make a decision about something that relates to women.Abortion kills a human offspring at the stage of human development called either embryo or fetus.  That doesn't make it non-human.  Infant, child, adolescent, and adult are names for other stages of human development.An embryo has, from the very moment of conception, it's own unique DNA.  That is a scientific fact.  It is not a part of a woman's body but a unique being that happens to be developing in the place where it was designed (by God or nature, your choice) to develop until the time it is ready for birth.It absolutely does affect everyone if   abortion   is legal.  There are many consequences to society, whether financial (when taxpayer funds are used to fund it, or in dealing with the medical consequences that often follow) or not (as in the higher rate of child abuse that we have in the time that abortion has been legal).I support groups that help women when they are in crisis pregnancy situations.  If a woman has a financial or emotional circumstance that may cause her to think that abortion is her only choice (or if she is pushed into an abortion by a boyfriend, husband, parent, or someone else), we as a society should stand up and let her know that there are ways that we can help her besides telling her that killing her child is the only option.  The way to help a woman with a crisis pregnancy is to help her solve the crisis.Abortion is a betrayal of women - even early feminists like Susan B. Anthony believed that.  Those who didn't are women like Margaret Sanger, who was a proponent of eugenics and a racist who supported Hitler."
1,"The mother's life is more valuable than the fetus. What makes the mothers life more important is that she is a full-grown adult and has the ability to make more children. 
"
1,"You better study your history dear child.  Hitler was all for eugenics and forcing abortions on those he didn't consider racially pure but if a German woman wanted an   abortion   whoa Nelly!  It was illegal to have an abortion for them and anyone who performed an abortion on their racially pure German women were executed for their ""crime"".  Let's just agree to disagree.  I believe that the woman is here and now.  Her health, her body, her life is paramount.  An embryo is an embryo.  No one forced you to have an abortion against your will but yet you feel you are so morally superior that you have the right to make decisions regarding other women.  99.9% of them are total strangers to you.  If you don't believe in abortion then don't have one.  End of argument.  I support your right to have as many pregnancies as your body can tolerate and if by chance it may kill you in the process, then I support your right to commit suicide in order to bring the fruit of your conception to delivery.  It's your business and your life just stay the hell out of other women's privacy.  We have thousands of children languishing in foster care, hundreds of thousands without homes living on the street or in homeless shelters because their parents don't have jobs (or don't make enough to pay rent), millions more without healthcare because their parents make too much money to qualify for state assistance but not enough to purchase health insurance.  Millions of children in this country go to bed every night hungry.  Why aren't you working your ass off to see that these problems are addressed FIRST before demanding that all women must be forced to live by YOUR moral code???  Many women wouldn't seek to have an abortion if they made a decent wage and had affordable health care so why don't you put your efforts into passing legislation to increase the minimum wage and make national healthcare a reality.  I bet you'd be surprised at how much that would reduce the numbers of abortions.  Oh, and since your side tends to be anti-birth control I'd suggest you also make sure that women of childbearing ability have all the access to that.  We don't need more pharmacists telling women that they can't take birth control pills because it offends their moral standards.  "
1,"Of course I've ""heard"" of adoption.  Golly, did I fall off the turnip truck today?  Your arguments are based on emotion, my arguments are based on fact and experience.  No one should force another to have a medical procedure against their will nor should you have the 'right' to impose your religious views on other women.  You have no right to interfere in another woman's right to privacy.  Banning   abortion   won't stop women from having an abortion it forces them to seek out an expensive and unsafe medical procedure that has a far greater chance of complications and death than having a safe procedure done by a qualified doctor.  I took care of women who aborted themselves and it wasn't pretty.  I found it rather disgusting to have a police officer come to her bedside when they should have been chasing real criminals.  We have nearly a half a million children in foster care and almost half of those need homes.  They may not be cute babies but they are no less deserving.  As I have said so many, many times before, if you don't believe in abortion then don't have one.  Work to make it a better world where few children are in foster care.  Where they can be born wanted, have access to shelter, food, medical care,  education and their mothers/parents can make a living wage so they don't have to worry if an unwanted pregnancy happens.  You are the same kind of people who want to ban birth control.  I find it outrages that people who work in pharmacies refuse to fill women's prescriptions for birth control pills because they 'don't believe' the have the right to prevent pregnancies.  Why people feel they must force their brand of religious insanity down other women's throats I'll never know.  There will always be cases where a woman's health requires having an abortion.  Her life and health will ALWAYS take precedence over a hunk of cells as far as I'm concerned.  There's no 'there' there when it comes to an embryo but a woman is very much 'here and now'.  Besides tbcass, you still haven't addressed my comments regarding the fact that unless the woman is a member of your family you still have no right to interfere in her privacy. Again, it's none of your business so get on with YOUR life and let others live there's.  You can't keep insisting that all pregnancies must be brought to birth and then just dump them out in the cold to fend for themselves..really, try and think this through."
1,"""Guess what? I'm an Atheist! I'm against   abortion   because I believe that it's wrong to take a human life period. I'm also against the death penalty. As a person with a degree in Biology I realize that Human life begins at conception.""In other words, one human being can coerce another human being to provide services for them, regardless of whether the other human being (providing the services) consented to this contract of sorts?"
2,This is definitely true. Women and teenage girls should be educated about this and they should have used protection! 
2,"Why do you think that   abortion   should be Legal? It's like killing a human. Why not give them the chance to live! Women make choices everyday! They made the choice to get pregnant and here are the consequences. They should learn from their mistakes and   adoption   is an option!!! Because an unwanted child can lead to an abused child, therefore they can choose adoption. Going to another topic...Gay marriage should be   legal  ! There are couples out there that really want to adopt a child in need but they can't. If you need the abortion because of rape or incest, medical complications should be allowed for them to get the abortion. Don't make the wrong choice if you can't handle the consequences!! Most abortions come from teenagers and they need to learn that   abstinence   is the way to go. Too much to say about this but i'll end it here."
1,"You're confusing that statement to mean that fetus is part of her body.  That's not what we mean. We mean that the woman has the right to her womb (which is part of her body).  As you said ""Common sense concludes that nobody has the right to control the life or death of another person regardless of their location, age, or status (born or not).""  But if you really meant that, your own common sense would conclude that the fetus does not have the right to control the life of another person.   Since the fetus is inside the womb, the woman must live her life for that fetus.  She gives up the right to control her life because of the location of the fetus.  She must, even at risk to herself (and risk is not merely death, but also of stroke, hemmorrage, etc.), carry that unborn ""child"".  It IS unfortunate, but it the design of nature... ""God"", whatever you want to say... that the fetus is carried by the woman instead of being laid as an egg.  Wouldn't that be nice? Then the egg could be abandoned if she wanted and anyone having a problem with that could take up the responsibility of caring for it until it hatched (was born).  The problem with saying that a woman has the rights to her womb ignores the potential child. I think it perfectly ridiculous to say that a woman can have an   abortion   is the fetus is mature enough to survive outside the womb.  In fact, if it even close to being able to do so, the woman should not be allowed an abortion, but should have a c-section instead.  The whole thing is not wanting to be pregnant... for whatever reason.  So by having a different procedure done (and it really is about the same), the woman retains control over her body and the problem is solved of 100% death to the babe.  If the baby dies, it is only because it was not able to survive.  Note, I am not saying that the medical community must ignore it, rather that the woman is merely evicting something she doesn't want from her womb.  She has absolved herself of responsibility from whatever happens to that fetus.  Anyway.  The ego that says the life of one is more valuable probably depends on where you're standing.  Do you value the life of your child over the lives of 3,613 strangers?  Do you value your life above that of 3,613 strangers?  Of course you do.  We all place greater value upon those we love and care about.    Why is it unnatural to place greater value upon the rights of your womb than the rights of a stranger to use your womb as it wishes?   The woman who chooses an abortion is merely choosing the right to keep her womb empty.  The woman who chooses to remain pregnant is voluntarily giving up her rights, and her life, for the fetus.  One is not a bad choice, and one an evil choice... we say we have individual rights, but pregnancy blurs the lines because one individual is actually  inside  the other.   But the bottom line in this is that the woman utimately must be able to have control over her womb.   Being able to have an abortion legally protects not only that right, but also the health and safety of the woman to do what is already in her rights to do. "
2,"your exact words ""But successful   abortion   carries a 100% rate of risk of death to the child""no duh, that's the whole point of abortion, is to KILL THE BABY. well actually that's MURDER"
1,"Murder is a   legal   concept in which one autonomous, self-aware individual intentionally kills another. As a embryo/fetus has no legal status as a person, how can it be murdered? It can be killed, but it cannot be murdered. Your use of the term 'murder' is simply a linguistic device designed to appeal to emotion rather than reason. It is precisely this sort of emotive discourse that hinders rational debate."
1,"Bottom line....it is the womans choice. Who are WE to tell another woman what she can and cannot do with her own body??? you dont have to be for it...or against it....but if YOU were in predicament....where at a point in your life you were not prepared...wouldnt you want to be able to decide for yourself what to do??? granted....perhaps there should be a point in a pregnancy where if youre a certain amount of time along that abortion couldnt be preformed, but again....i wouldnt dare tell another woman what to do. i dont think pro choice is PROMTING abortion...but it IS promoting the right to choose. this is something i am greatful to have as a young woman."
2,"I think it is important to point out that, in the United States, a human ""fetus"" only a few days from being born has less rights than a dog.  Is that right?And do people honestly think that a baby inside the womb is ""part of the woman's body?"""
1,"Women can reproduce new children with equal value to the aborted. The potential of any given child is unimportant in the context of it being possible, after an abortion, for a mother to reproduce many more children. Who is to say that a particular child has any more potential than the next? This argument is strengthened by the fact that women and couples typically aim to produce a certain number of children. Even if they abort a child (they'll still aim to produce the same number), so the quantity of newborns and potential is not diminished by the existence of abortion. 
"
1,"A dog is not a person. Therefore, it does not have rights. Positive feelings about dogs should have no bearing on the discussion.A fetus is not a person. Therefore, it does not have rights. Negative feelings about the metaphysically independent status of women should have no bearing on the discussion."
2,"I'm not sure how you got the idea that animals and fetuses don't have rights.  They do.  And whether you like it or not, animals in this country have MORE rights than do fetuses (or children as some like to call them).So I ask: When does a fetus become a person?  When it is 100% out of the womb?  Can you kill it (as some do) 3/4 out or leave it to die in a utility closet by inducing early labor?  Isn't this a moral question that should be taken with more gravity than dismissing it as a non-person to secure a woman's ""right"" to choose her convenience over responsibility for two peoples' actions in most cases?"
1,"Properly, animals and fetuses do NOT possess individual rights. Rights belong only man. Only man possesses the rational faculty. Do you intend to reason with an animal? Do you intend to instruct neighborhood dogs not to defecate on your lawn or you will file a lawsuit? Do you intend to caution a wild bear that he will be arrested if he attacks you? Animals do not have rights because they cannot reason; they must be dealt with by force.The fact that some yahoo somewhere decides to pass a law protecting dogs and fetuses does not suddenly mean that animals and fetuses are rationally entitled to rights; it simply means that irrationality has taken hold in that yahoo's district.A fetus becomes a person at birth. That would be real birth, not what evangelicals arbitrarily redefine as birth. An abortion is not a birth.No one is simply dismissing anything. Reason is clear on this: A fetus is not a person. And the moral position is that an actual individual should not be treated as a means to the ends of other persons or non-persons."
2,"Animals, and fetuses, have a right to life at the very least.  If they had no rights, then animal cruelty wouldn't be a problem, now would it?Where exactly do you get the notion that animals and fetuses have rights?  Where do you get the notion that humans have rights?  If you are rationally making the statement that a fetus becomes a person at birth (wherever you derive that standard from), what about that baby that is 3/4 out?  What about a baby that can survive on its own after 8 months in the womb?  What makes that magical instant where every inch of that baby is outside of the mother the key to its humanity?The coldness of the argument you present, along with the arbitrary nature of your declaration, is a little scary.  Denying that abortion is a moral choice, and that the unborn and animals have any rights whatsoever is also scary."
1,"Animal cruelty is NOT a political problem, unless you are a collectivist. Although animal abuse should be condemned morally, it should not be illegal. Animals do not have rights and are the property of their owners. If you deny this, then you cannot claim a right to eat meat and wear leather. You have lost any principled argument you can make for these practices, and if you make pragmatic arguments, then you confess to being a murderer as well as a hypocrite. You also make a great leap down a very slippery slope.Degrees of ""out of the birth canal"" is not fundamental here; what is fundamental is the nature of the entity. Again, a fetus becomes a person at birth. The laws of nature eventually result in a fetus becoming survivable, fully formed, its organs functioning autonomously, and the whole organism becoming metaphysically independent, and at that time, the law of cause-and-effect induces childbirth. Nature, or reality, is what sets the standard, not medical technology or the arbitrary say-so of people. We must deal with a thing as it is, now how we can imagine it or emote it to be.Frankly, your question, ""Where do you get the notion that humans have rights?"" is scarier than any coldly rational argument I could ever make about anything. I also don't see you asking about the moral implications of the view that a pregnant woman should be forced into the metaphysical status of a plastic incubator."
1,"Might want to change ""man"" to ""human""."
1,"Just because a dog is not a 'person' it does not mean it does not, or should not have rights. It seems bizarre to me that people care more about the unborn foetus than they do about the millions of dogs and other non-human animals who are already alive and suffering at the hands of the human race."
2,"Person: 1. a human being. (define.com)Is a fetus a human being? YES: one of the many stages of development of a human being. Others are: zygote, morula, embryo, baby. toadler, teenager, adult, elder. We have a life of continuous development. From conception to death. these are facts not opinions.So Fetus=Human Being=PersonOther Human beings deprived of their personhood: Native americans and African American Slaves in the US, Jews in Nazi Germany,  All the slaves in history: all considered property instead of persons."
1,Dead bodies do not have rights.
2,"1. Dead bodies kind of have rights: there is homocide with barbarity and cruelty.2. I said stages of development, not stages. I said from conception to death. When someone dies it doesn't develop anymore, it's body starts decaying."
1,"If women can't be trusted with ""choice"", how can they be trusted with children? It is important that society trust in women and individuals to make the right moral choices. In regard to abortion, if women can't be trusted to make the right choice, how can they be trusted with children?
"
1,"Cannot be committed against a dead person. A dead body has no rights whatsoever. Legally, it has some PROTECTIONS, but protections do not equate to rights. THese protections are both a) sort of new, and b) not generalizable towards all corpses.Define development. Everything develops into something else. Corpses have stages of development. If you're defining life as a single-celled organism with a unique genetic code, corpses have a lot of those."
2,"What are these corpse's stages of developmnent you are talking about? How are they called?I talk about human life's development which starts at conception and ends with death. While there is much debate on when does the life of a human being begins, there is no doubt on when does this life ends.You said: Dead body is a stage of a human being. A stage of ""what""? of a human being?. Surely not of the life of a human being because life, as everybody knows, ends with death.And: Dead bodies do not have rights. To which i answered ""kind of"" in the sense that to kill doing barbaric acts on a corpse(whichever) is worse than just plain murder."
1,"Babies ARE part of the mother.  They are part of ""her"" body.  Saying otherwise is ridiculous.  Where does the baby receive life?  From the mother giving it life by letting it live off of her food, water, blood, etc.  Does everyone make wrong decisions?  Yes.  But if a man decides to make a poor decision by having unprotected sex with a woman, he can leave.  Now this woman has part of a man in her that she doesn't want as well as no father to bring it into this world.  Why does she have to suffer due to someone else being a coward?  The government is not going to pay her enough to properly feed herself and take care of the baby before she can birth it to give to adoption.  Unless the government says ""Here's maternity pay at the rate you were receiving prior to your pregnancy as well as free food for the baby,"" why should she pay for this?  It should be up to her to decide.  "
1,"I didn't realize that an adam's apple and male genetalia were a common part of a woman's anatomy.  Tell me though, which part of the woman is this child?  And why, unlike almost every other cell in her body, does this part not share the entirety of her DNA?"
2,"its just selfish.  ok, i'll exclude cases where there is some sort of complication.  if it's a choice between abortion, and both people dieing, i dont have a problem with that.my main problem with it is that the man has absolutly no say in this.  lets say a woman gets pregnant.  the man wants the child, and the woman doesn't.  the guy can kind of see it coming and may try to talk her out of it, but that's the best he can do.  while the male half is already attached to the baby, the female half could be out there having his baby killed without him even knowing.  a child that the man wants, and would take all responsability for.  financial and otherwise.  anything it takes to keep his child alive.  it would be absolutely devastating when the guy finds that out.a sad story, yes?  now lest say that story is true.  we'll say that because it is.  my baby was killed years ago, and it still hurts.  i tried everything i could to keep my baby alive, and i failed. it was an impossible battle."
1,"I am sorry for your loss. Unfortunately, I believe that you are the exception. I am sure that there are many women out there who had abortions and would have kept the baby if they had the same level of support that you were willing to offer. Many women don't get that support. Alternatively on the point that men should be included in the debate, I have personally heard a few men exclaim that it is unfair that they made a mistake one night, and now have to pay child support for 18 years because they didn't have a say in the matter. So men's inclusion in the issue wouldn't necessarily lead to less   abortion  . I don't think that the government (or anyone else for that matter) should ever have control over women's reproductive choices. For instance, I would be just as strongly opposed to government mandated abortions as I am towards banning abortion all together. Many women, including myself, find it unfair that men enter the   abortion debate   because a man is intrinsically different than a woman. I don't have a say over a man's reproductive organs, nor do I think that I should. Similarly, I don't think that men, the government, other women, etc. should be able to tell a woman that she has to give up her body for 9 months, regardless of what she wants. It is making her a second class citizen and a prisoner to her own womb. Once again, I am sorry for your personal experience. Maybe people should decide as a couple where they stand on the abortion debate before engaging in sex. Even so, I guess that speculation about what you would do in the event of an unplanned   pregnancy   can't be comparable to when you are actually faced with the decision. "
2,Even rape victims can prevent their pregnancies. its called the morning after pill. since the egg hasn't implanted yet it can not be consitered an abortion since the woman isn't pregnant yet.  murder is not legal so i'm not sure why abortion is even a debateRoe of roe vs. wade. is now pro life and fighting to over turn that death sentence
1,"This would almost be a decent compromise, except rape is a lot more complicated than that.Many times violence is also involved in rape, and in a hospital emegency room your immediate health is what they are focused on, and you may not be able to get a pill within that 24 hour window. And there are many places that refuse to sell morning after pills. What happens then if you live in a small town and the only pharmacy around won't give it to you? What if they're raped by a family member, and can't get away within 24 hrs? What if you can't afford the pill? It can cost more than $300 to get one from a hospital ER, which is the only thing open during off-hours. Say what you might against abortion, rape victims should always have that option. This includes statutory rape. No 15 year old should have their dreams shattered by being forced to have a baby, be it by violent rape, being coerced into sex by an older male, incest, or anything else that may have been out of their control."
2,but i am responding as a rape victim.  i am holding in my arms the results of that rape. my son is the world to me.   an abortion would be just as tramatizing as a rape
1,"For some women having the rapist's child would be more traumatizing than   abortion  . You are a very brave and strong woman. You had the choice though, to continue the   pregnancy   or not. That option should be available to all women, whether or not you personally agree with their ultimate decision. "
2,"The ""dialysis"" analogy is invalid; pregnancy is unique One of the most famous arguments against abortion is the ""dialysis analogy"" put forward by Judith Jarvis in 1971. It compares abortion to a situation in which a healthy woman (the mother by analogy) is attached to a dying patient (the fetus by analogy) in order to keep the dying patient alive. The concept is that the dying person does not have a right to the woman's body, and that the woman has a right to ""unplug"" (abort) even if it means the death of the other person. The problem with the analogy is many fold: 1. A woman and a fetus have a special relationship that is incomparable to that between a woman and a stranger or even a relative. There is a special biological drive inside the mother to keep the baby alive and a dependency by the baby on the mother. The mother, therefore, has a special responsibility to keep her child alive and not abort; 2. A woman often gives a form of tacit approval to the existence of a fetus in her womb: the act of engaging in sexual behavior; 3. abortion directly kills the embryo and does not merely ""unplug"" and let it die. These are critical differences that invalidate a classic, central argument for abortion.

1,"If abortion is murder in some cases, then it is murder in every case. If a fetus has rights, then there is no moral basis to make an exception for rape. That just takes the rape victims feelings into account, which can't be put above the rights of the fetus."
1,"is not the right to exist under any and all sets of circumstances. No human being has that right.  And the development of the distinctive characteristic of human being's to reason and make judgments is the operative context in which the law defines the ages at which the full support of (recognition) and weight of (punishment)the law extends in any set of circumstances. Children, for example, do not, under normal circumstances, have the right to decide how they will be raised.  By the same token, parents do not have the right to beat a child into submission, either.  In both cases, it is the adults who are in judgment, not the children.  Since it is the adults who are considered to be 'of the age of majority' it is they to who have the right to raise their child and they who are punished for the abuse."
1,"You make a distinction between conception and implantation? How is the fetus less of a human before implantation. If you argue that there is something that has rights because of a unique combination of genetics, then IUDs and Morning After pills are murder and implantation has no relevance.If, instead, you argue that implantation is the important event, then I would wonder, why not some other event in development? Gastrulation is a miracle, so is the rearrangement of the MHC complex (where the fetus defines what is self and what is other). How about a heart beat or a first breath. They all seem like equally momentous events in the creation of a new human being."
2,"One could look at the womb as an organic life support system.  If someone is alive, but needs mechanical aid to breath, then taking that away would be murder.  One could reason that the same would be true if it were non-mechanical.  On the other hand, if someone needed life support, and they were in the process of trying to get it from you without your consent, then denying it would probably not be murder.  If it did not pose a hardship to provide the aid, then it might be depraved indeifference to human life, but if it did impose a hardship it might not even be that."
1,Too many times hospital ER's (usually Catholic) refuse to give woman the information that they can take the 'morning after' pill or pharmacists refuse to give them out because it's 'against their religion'.  Hence the rape victim must then resort to the medical procedure.
1,"The   morning after pill   has a failure rate. What do you suggest for these women who have taken Plan B after rape, and the Plan B fails? Then what? "
2,"I was pro-choice for many years, ever since I knew what abortion was. As much as I hate to admit to being wrong, I was definitely wrong on my stance on abortion. The horrors of the procedure are real, and the results are absolutely devastating. Just look at pictures of aborted fetuses with their arms and heads chopped off. It's truly a disgusting thing. We also now know that these fetuses can indeed feel pain, therefore it is a very abrupt, painful death to an unborn child. Most women who have them regret their decision. For all you know you might have just aborted the person who found the cure for cancer or diabetes. However, we'll never know as they didn't get a chance. Abortion is unethical and those who perform them are murderers. "
1,That those who regret their decision do so because they don't understand the fundamental moral right they have to make it? The issue has not been well-defended. See the comment from the Ayn Rand Center.  
2,those who regret it do so because they know the have killed their baby.  my mother says this after her abortion 27 years ago
1,"your mother feels that she killed her baby, of course she regrets that -- particularly if she felt that having a baby would have been a good thing.  And she must have.  She had at least one other child -- you.But bagpiper2005 said 'most' and I wanted to issue a ittle challenge to get some more thinking along with the obvious emotion that, for some understaable reeasons, goes with this issue.If we have had children and wanted them and loved them we can, mistakenly I believe, see our own child being killed.  What a devistating thing that would be!As ARC has commennted on this thread, it is the first trimester that is the basic issue. Though I am not associated with ARC, I agree. Rights are recognized in context. And in the context of a woman's adult life, it is her right to decide, within the first trimester, that must be recognized. If, after she decides on an abortion, she is remorseful, that is certainly sad. But her remorse is not grounds for denying the righ to an abortion to those who regret having a child and kill them -- either physically or emotionally -- after they are born.AF"
2," The right to choice/privacy (abortion) does not override the right to life Jesse Jackson, U.S. civil rights activist, now in favor of legal abortion, in National Right to Life News, (January, 1977) - ""There are those who argue that the right to privacy is of [a] higher order than the right to life ... that was the premise of slavery. You could not protest the existence or treatment of slaves on the plantation because that was private and therefore outside your right to be concerned."" Thus, even if a woman has a right to her body and to ""choice"", this right is overridden by the fetus's right to life. And, what could be more important than life? All other rights, including the mother’s right to choice, surely stem from a prior right to life; if you have no right to any life, then how do you have a right to an autonomous one? The woman may ordinarily have a reasonable right to control her own body, but this does not confer on her the entirely separate (and insupportable) right to decide whether another human lives or dies.
"
1,"""Just look at pictures of aborted fetuses with their arms and heads chopped off."" Okay, look at pictures of fetuses. Do they look like actual people? No, of course not. They look like fetuses. That is because they are fetuses, not human beings. ""...unborn child."" Contradiction in terms. Children have been born. A fetus is not a child.""For all you know you might have just aborted the person who foudn teh cure for cancer or diabetes."" People are not aborted. Fetuses get aborted. Fetuses are not people.""...those who perform them are murderers."" Murder means to deliberately kill another human being justifiably. Fetuses are not human beings. Therefore, those who perform abortions are not murderers."
1,"I meant ""unjustifiably"" in that last paragraph. Apologies."
2,"- A fetus at 39 weeks: looks just like my son 5 minutes after birth (    http://www.birth.com.au/InfoBits/Pics/5-37.gif    )A fetus at 15 weeks: head, body, arms, legs, fingers, toes, eyes... that's not a cat (    http://www.birth.com.au/InfoBits/Pics/67-10.jpg    )An embryo at 9 weeks: i not know exactly what it was, but it is definitely an animal (not a plant) and it has a head, arms, legs, fingers. (    http://www.birth.com.au/InfoBits/Pics/66-30.gif    )An embryo at 6 week: just by looking I would have not idea what this was (    http://www.birth.com.au/InfoBits/Pics/66-28.gif    )Conclusion: a fetus looks remarkably like a newborn human person; there must be a connection.(I couldn't find actual pictures, so the medical style depictions will have to do for now.  Can someone find actual pictures?)"
1,"But even if it were, you would have a very poor one. A fetus simply looks like a fetus. It can clearly be identified as such. Imagining it as a person doesn't make it so."
2,"I guess you did not look at the pictures.  Even a 3 year old will identify a fetus as a human baby... mine did, and she is not unique in that respect.I'll expound on this tomorrow."
2,"If you don't want a baby, Then keep your legs crossed and/or use protection!!!!!!!!!Yes an embryo is a stage in life like an infant, adolescent, adult and etc.It is human. Why be selfish and take a life just so you can live yours all happy after. Take responsibility!!! ;DIt's not that complicated."
1,"And the logic follows. If you don't want to have an   abortion  , don't have one."
2,How and why do you think that an embryo is not an alive and living soon to be human being?
2,"Ok, this is actually kinda funny..Technically fetuses are not people, but come on Wendy.. Fetuses eventually WILL BE people and children, without question if they weren't KILLED. So, how is any of this relevant?  And also, a murderer is someone who takes another's life.. and that is exactly what they are doing when KILLING A CHILD or fetus or whatever you would like to justify it as to make yourself feel better. I do not understand how people would want to kill their own child when they knew all along that pregnancy could happen. I do not see why the child should have to suffer for their parents horrible decisions..a baby is so innocent..they have done nothing wrong to the world...so have the child and bless someone else with the privilege that one is taking for granted. "
1,"Using your 'logic' then every woman of child bearing age must be constantly pregnant because not fertilizing every one of her developed eggs would mean the 'death' of a potential human being or that every man's ejaculate should be preserved because each sperm could result in a 'potential' human.Again, this issue will never be resolved because I don't consider   abortion   'murder'.  To me an embryo is a potential person but the woman IS the person therefor her rights and her health are paramount. End of discussion.  Don't believe in abortion...don't have one.  "
2,"Women should be held responsible for behavior leading to impregnation. If one does not want to have a baby, they should not have sex, or they should take extreme precaution when having sex. Sex is not a game. It is a serious matter of reproduction and life. If a woman plays with it and becomes pregnant, she should be held responsible to carry out the birth of her child. And, it should be noted that the responsibility could end at child-birth, with it being possible to put a child up for adoption. The consequences of an unwanted pregnancy need not be major, but they must be born by the mother and father. 
"
1,"Wendy, or anyone for that matter, prove that a human embryo, or a human fetus, is NOT a human being; note that being is definded as something having the quality of existence, something that actually exists, or a life - Webster's.So to rephrase, you must now validate your claim by proving that a living human embryo/fetus is not an actually existing human life."
1,"See all my other posts on this forum, but particularly my recent one in which I show that you are definition dodging in your use of the word ""human"" and also explain that ""alive"" is not the essence of ""person,"" and show how there is no basis for claiming that the two concepts together have significance synergistically."
1,"But seriously, I've seen your posts, nowhere do you refute the HUMANITY of a HUMAN embryo/fetus.  Can I be any more blunt?  You cannot prove the absence of the subject, nor can you deny the race (the human race) to which he/she belongs.  Therefore, and since I have here proven that an unborn human is still a human being; and since it is also true that said humans are alive, they are therefore, by definition, persons.  End of case."
1,"I believe I refuted the ""humanity"" of fetuses when I pointed out on multiple occasions that they do not possess consciousness or metaphysical independence. I could be mistaken, but there are no known fetuses who give to their favorite non-profit, write great works, or express admiration for sublime music and poetry. Let me know when that happens, and I will be glad to revise my concept of fetuses. Heck, I would even give way if they merely showed their humanity by considerately offering their unwilling, burdened hosts a break by taking up residence in an incubator somewhere instead.But since you like dictionaries, dodge this: ""1. The quality of being human; the peculiar nature of man, by which he is distinguished from other beings.""--Webster's Revised Unabridged 1996.Hmmm...What is peculiar to man? By what is he distinguished from other beings? The rational faculty. Aristotle already proved this."
1,"pig fetuses?By the way, I don't recall any proof that the fetus lacks the 'rational faculty,' and since you're bringing it up, the burden of proof is on you.  However, just because a being doesn't speak, doesn't mean it's irrational.  Furthermore, if you're going to differentiate between beings, then you must include supernatural beings (whether or not they exist) into your assertion, since God is a rational being (even if only in concept), your logic dictates that He must be a man, hence your choice of differentiation is flawed."
2,thats true i looked at the pictures of the fetuses thats just a crying shame. and the babies look so sad and scary lol. i chose not have an   abortion   but i did have my baby so i have experienced it.
2,"Does a fetus looks like we expect it to look? Does we expect it to look like a baby?Does we expect a baby to look like an adult? No of course. Still the three of them are all humans beings and all are in continuous development.Child: 2.a human offspring (son or daughter) of any age. (define.com) Since the offspring comes into existence at conception it is absolutely correct to say ""...unborn child.""Person: 1. a human being.

It is homocide: the killing of a human being by another human being(define.com)"
1,"Those gruesome pictures the pro-pregnancy crowd likes to display are not the usual aborion procedure.  Late term   abortion   are usually rare and only to save the life of the mother.  Besides, these pictures have been around for decades so they were probably done ages ago.  The majority of abortions happen in the first trimester and you'd be hard pressed to find anything that looks human.  In fact, it would require a microscope to find the embryo.  You have every right to consider abortion an act of ""murder"" even though there isn't a fully formed human involved. Just remember, it's the woman is the fully formed human with feelings, a life, and a future.  Your God aborts almost half of all conceptions in the first 8 weeks so I guess God isn't so anti-abortion as you are. "
1,"Late term abortions are the exception not the norm.  The majority of abortions are performed in the first trimester and you'd need a microscope to see the results of that.  Those pictures that you speak of are over 40 years old.  Many of these were performed in places outside of the US where they didn't have more sophisticated medical means of termination.  Late term abortions are only done if the mother's health is at stake. In other words, she's at risk of imminent death or in some cases if the fetus won't survive birth and it puts the woman at risk.  Again, you don't believe in   abortion   don't have one.  What other women do in their decision making is none of your business and you have no right to make those decisions for them.   To you it's unethical and you consider it murder. To the majority of us, we consider it a health issue and a privacy issue.  I wouldn't support a country that forces a woman to have an abortion against her will anymore than I would support a nation that forces a woman to give birth against her will.  It's a privacy issue.  Unless you are willing to pony up more tax dollars to help support these 1.2 million more births I'd suggest you should stop passing judgment on the decisions of those 1.2 million women who have to make difficult choices regarding their lives.  Until the fetus is able to breath on it's own, it's still considered part of the woman's body.  It's stupid and selfish to force a million more children to be born into poverty and suffering when you continue to ignore the one's here who need help.  You'll never find enough people to adopt a million children per year every year.  Besides, not every woman would want to put them up for adoption. If women were making a living wage, had affordable health insurance, housing, affordable childcare, you'd be surprised at how many fewer abortions were done every year.  Why not but more of your time and energy into those problems and help get those put into place instead of browbeating women over their private decisions?  "
2,"Here you can look at more recent pictures of abortions:   http://www.abort73.com  /?/print/14/These are graphics of   abortion   procedures:  http://www.abort73.com/preview/images/techniques/suction/02.jpg   (9 weeks fetus)  http://www.abort73.com/preview/images/techniques/de14/thumb/02.jpg   (14 weeks)  http://www.abort73.com/preview/images/techniques/de23/thumb/02.jpg   (23 weeks viable fetus)Extract from plannedparenthood: ""Either a hand-held suction device or a suction machine gently empties your uterus"". Still think this is gently?"
1,"The fetus causes physical pain; the woman has a right to self-defense. The fetus causes sickness, discomfort, and and extreme pain to a woman during her pregnancy and labor. It is, therefore, justifiable for a woman to pursue an abortion in self-defense. 
"
2,"A woman's rights are not the only rights that need to be respected in abortion: Of course, human-rights should be respected, but it is never the case that a person has a right to make a decision with no reference to the rights and wishes of others. There are two primary rights that must be considered in addition to the rights of the woman. First, the father has some rights over the fetus. Second, the fetus itself may have some rights. The point is merely that the woman's interests and rights cannot be the only ones under consideration. 
"
1,"I'm almost at the end of my reproductive years, so I will not be personally burdened by any future government rulings on the subject. My darling daughter however, is just beginning her reproductive years, I want her and her children to continue to have the right not to bear any ill-conceived offspring.  For us, our family would simple cough up the money for a plane ride for someplace where a legal and safe abortion could still be obtained. But what's a poor woman to do? Butcher herself? Or face the risk of childbirth with a child that she did not love and did not obtain proper prenatal care for? Sigh, as if we need more kids like that around."
1,"""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."" - Declaration of IndependenceI cite this since I'm assuming we're talking about American Law, and to note that this inherrently axiomatic assumption by the 'Founding Fathers' is why this wasn't addressed in the Bill of Rights or the Constitution.  On a side note: the existence of a Creator is herein considered the basis for all American law, and therefore the lack of consideration (or abolition thereof) removes any premise to consider any right of anything whatsoever (including 'choice').From high school biology, the cell is the fundamental unit of life; if there exists a living cell (whether whole or otherwise), there exists life.  The distinguishing factor between humans and everything else, if nothing else, is our DNA.  Human DNA is unique and quite distinctive; as is generally phenotypically (according to looks) obvious.As was stated before; the presence (or lack thereof) of appendages or other parts (eyes, ears, etc.) is irrelevant and arbitrary; otherwise we could justify the murder of the legless.  Therefore it is likewise irrelevant in qualifying a human being for fundamental rights (in this case, life)."
1,"On what grounds do you claim human DNA as the ""distinguishing factor?"" On what grounds can you now logically object to granting inalienable rights to human unfertilized eggs, sperm cells, and tumors?Supernatural entities as the basis of individual rights is an irrational concept. And in practice, despite the flowery language, religion has never served as the basis of our politico-economic system. It simply isn't, and that is a fact. Our system is a secular one, based on the predominant ideas of the Enlightenment, and it should remain that way."
1,"DNA is what distinguishes any organism from every other, according to science (Biology specifically).  Again, we're talking about HUMAN DNA.  I'm sure you'd agree that something like bipedality is trivial.  Tumors aren't organisms - they're part of an organism; or rather the corruption thereof.  Unfertilized eggs & sperm don't have complete DNA; only half; and again, aren't complete organisms, only part of another organism.  The union of a human sperm cell, and human egg, produces a new human being - (see the above).Now the debate isn't about the theological foundations of the United States of America; though it's undeniable.  If you don't like it (whether rational or otherwise), you are free to move - China has a nice Godless government; Russia does too.  However; the argument is purely logical.  If you deny a Creator, you deny any reasonable source for the ""inalienable rights"", and therefore all rights, including the so-called 'right to choose', since there is no longer any rational basis for equality.  Justice, Morality, and Ethics are inherently non-secular.  If our system were truly secular and based on the Enlightenment, there would be no reference to a Creator, and the First Amendment would never have included anything remotely pertaining to religion.As for the practice, where else do you get laws against murder, rape, and theft, except from religion?  Relativism holds no standard, for the one on trial can always say ""well that may be good for you but ...""Now you may object that the law isn't relative, but that which has a relativ basis is inherently relative.  Thus if our justice/legal system is based on something as relative as 'cultual/social norms', it is likewise, fundamentally  relative.But this is a tangent and I'll discuss it no further.You're job is to refute that an embryo or fetus isn't a human being.  There's only 2 ways: 1. they aren't human (they are); 2. they aren't living beings (they are).If you claim something as obscure as dependency, then you are no more protected than they are, for you are not biologically or ecologicaly or socially independent, and therefore your reasoning for abortion could be extended to you.  If you make the claim 'it doesn't look human'  that only applies within the first 3 wks, and then your ratioale could also apply to the handicapped - or even people of different hair, eye, or skin color."
1,"Traveling down the Hitlerian road, now, are we? Since there is very little in the way of DNA differences between chimps and humans, 0.8% difference in sequence identity, and there is a .2% average difference between whites and blacks, does that mean that blacks have a sub-white status? Or do we bring apes into the inalienable individual rights fold? Tell me, please, what is the cutoff number?Biologically, DNA is only half the story. A LOT of unique things have to happen inside a cell and modifications must be made TO its DNA in order for a fertilized egg to even develop into a fetus, so don't call on biology to help you with this argument. A scientist will merely shrug and tell you that what defines a species is reproductive isolation - not DNA.Merely having human DNA does not make a fetus a person. DNA may be a precondition of an organism, but it is not fundamental to this discussion. What is fundamental is the actual nature of the entity involved. A fetus is not a person."
1,"Yes, yes you apparently are, for I but mirror your argument.  Now, since you bring it up, the first and primary (and therefore legal) definition of the word person is ""Human Individual"" or humand being - Webster's.So what makes a human being?  DNA for one.  Like you said, there are other factors, but development isn't one of them, and niether is age.  There is, however, another way to determine one's humanity; when both parents of the child are human.  Since there has yet to be shown (and never can be) any incident where two organisms of the same species successfully reproduced a member of a different species (hence the 're' in 'reproduce')."
1,"So human parentage is your latest criteria? This is starting to bore me. So you are saying that if there were cognitively advanced alien life forms and we ever encountered them, they would not have rights since they are not human and certainly not of human parentage? And if they do have rights, what is the basis for those rights, since the aliens are not ""persons?"" Or are they? Why? What does your Webster's have to say about that?What about anencephalic fetuses of human parentage?You keep changing your criterion for personhood. First it was body parts/general morphology, then random physiological characteristics, then DNA, then parentage. Each time, I invalidated your criterion, so like a Darwinian species, you evolved and latched onto another one. You have now reached the point where you in effect argue for multiple criteria for personhood to keep your argument going, but you cannot specify which ones are essential, and why they are essential.If you continue to follow your line of argument with the alien example and on to its logical conclusion, you will either reach the same self-contradictory end that you keep reaching, or, if you made a serious intellectual effort to resolve the contradictions as you keep increasing the number of characteristics that go into a human, you would reach my point: Concepts, e.g., ""persons,"" are ultimately referenced demonstrably--that is a person, there is another person--and they include all their characteristics. The only way to know what is a human being is by looking at reality, not inward into your consciousness.Reality exists independent of the human mind, reality does not reside IN definitions, and the function of the mind is to look at reality and integrate its observations into concepts. If you do so, you will literally see that a fetus is not the same thing as a person. A definition's function is to distinguish a class of existents from each other, not to dictate or replace reality (or one's grasp of it)."
1,"You're the one who's claiming body parts as criteria, as per your question of ancephalics, who are recognized as human beings (even you would, if you'd let 'em live long enough), I never did.I've never changed any criteria for humanity (to say that it no longer was), I've elaborated, and suggested additional criterion, always stating that it's unwise to restrict one's basis for humanity to any particular criteria (plural form intended).I still maintain that DNA is a major factor for determining humanity, though you'd know that if you'd even read my last post, I clarify my position that DNA may be essential (depending upon whether there is any truly distinctive set of genes for humanity), but parentage certainly is, as per all known empirical evidence, like produces like.You have yet to invalidate any of my arguments; you haven't even given a source for your percentages, which are highly unbelievable.I have yet to contradict myself, and you have yet to say anything substantial.By the way, if you look at a fetus, it does look like a human being, except for size and development, in fact the distinguishing characteristic of a fetus is that it has the ""basic structural plan of its kind"" - Webster's - which means all bones, organs, and tissues, whether functional or otherwise."
1,"""The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion"" - Treaty of Tripoli, 1797, signed by John Adams, passed unanimously by the Senate, with no sign of public dissent.In other words, the government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion. Straight from the horse's mouth, it doesn't get any clearer than that. The Founders conscientiously derived their secular political philosophy from Enlightenment ideas. It deliberately recognized and secured individual rights, a unique historical achievement. Religion never has, and in fact, has only ever acted against it. Tell us, what does the Bible have to say about individual rights, checks and balances, veto power, Constitutional amendments, bicameral legislatures, republican government, enumerated powers, etc.? I thought so.Moral relativism vs. religion is a false alternative promulgated by religionists. Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand, provides the secular, absolute, rational basis for individual rights and the American system of government. It does so flawlessly, unlike religion, which has only ever caused an erosion of individual rights. Its ethics is fully secular. It is not based on moral relativism. Objectivism formalizes what every culture knows: That legal prohibitions against murder, rape, theft, etc., are necessary to secure the lives of its members."
1,"A fetus is not *metaphysically* independent. That is the fundamental issue. The other types of dependence are worse than irrelevant: Every living thing is biologically interdependent.An embryo or fetus is what it is. No one denies the facts that I have stated about their nature. What is denied is their significance, in order to make room for a religious interpretation. There is no escaping it: Either reason or religion must be used to answer this question. And religion is not a valid basis for government. Further, reason clearly states that the burden of proof is on you to establish that a fetus is a person entitled to individual rights, not on me to disprove it."
2," The scale of abortions makes state intervention compelling Some argue that abortion is an individual moral choice that the state should not get involved with. Yet, when an individual moral choice is practiced on a massive scale, it becomes a concern for broader society and government as well.
"
1,"Funny that you should be using metaphysics in an argument; but thanks for making my point: dependence isn't a criteria for life, humanity, or lack thereof.Okay, good, so who cares about pig embryos?  In other words, a fetus and an embryo are both living beings; more specifically we're talking about HUMAN embryos and fetuses, and thus HUMAN beings, and therefore we are talking about persons, the plural of which is people.  Thank you once again for making my case.Now, I believe you are confusing this argument with arguments for existence in which the burden of proof is logically one-sided.  We're not debating whether unborn human beings (persons) exist, that's already proven.  We're debating whether these beings are human or not.  You can prove whether or not they're human; I have.  Now the burden of proof still remains with you that they are not human, or not alive.  You cannot make either case, because the contrary to both of these assertions is false."
1,"First, religion is entirely based on faith. Faith is a means of knowledge other than reason. Religion and reason are irreconcilable.Second, metaphysics is not a religious concept; it is a philosophical one, so it is not funny at all that I should mention it. Third, you are putting words in my mouth. I clearly said that independence--metaphysical independence--IS a criteria for personhood, an absolute requirement. That is because a person has an independent, functioning human consciousness. A fetus by its very nature does not have that. You are the one obsessed with physical and biological dependence and interdependence and umbilical cords, not me.Finally, you have not proven anything; you have simply definition dodged again. You are in a beg the question situation. When we talk about ""pig"" or ""human"" embryos, we are referring to their biological heritage (from Homo sapiens), not their moral-legal status (person). The biological heritage usage constitutes an alternate definition of the word. Indeed, in another post, you do go so far as to say that ""human parentage"" is what makes the definition of a human being or person, and since these fetuses are of human parentage, they are therefore human beings or persons. I have already invalidated human parentage as the essence of the concept ""person"" in another post.I have also invalidated ""alive"" as the essence of personhood. It is simply a precondition. Nor is there any basis for claiming that ""alive"" and ""of human parentage"" together have significance synergistically. Again, in another post, I explain that fetuses and humans are what they are out there in reality; they are not their definitions or an assembly of random characteristics."
1,"Blind Faith is a means of knowledge other than reason, pure faith is based on reason i.e. you have faith that the air you breath is beneficial to your health because of the reason that you know that the oxygen (which you take by faith to be in the air) is required for cellular respiration (a process that you also take on faith - as is the case with almost all of your knowledge).metaphysics is the 'study' of the theoretical especially the supernatural, and it is funny because you're trying to sound like naturalism supports your cause; furthermore the distinction between the religious and the philosophical is negligible.So you're saying that the presence of a soul is the requirement for personhood, and are requiring proof that it inhabits the being from conception?  I therefore challenge you, prove that you have a soul.If conciousness is your criteria, a fetus is conscious of itself and its surroundings; it can feel pain, for one proof, as evidenced by its neurosystem if nothing else.  Furthermore, what about the victims of accidents who fall unconscious: do they suddenly lose their humanity?  So then, someone could legally kill you if they knocked you out first and did it while you were out, right?  But you still failed to prove that a fetus, at any stage lacks consciousness - or that it matters.Techincally, you are the one obsessed with 'phyisical/biological dependence and ubilical cords'; I've repeatedly said they're irrelevant - that's the point.Semantics.  The biological heritage is the most verifiable criterion for personhood.  A person, by official, authoritative definition, is a living human being.  Their biological heritage is the foundation of their moral-legal status.Now, I never claimed that life was a component of humanity (it's not a prerequisite either though, as many dogs are also alive); but you can't kill a corpse, so the question of life is relevant and therefore has 'synergistic significance.'Now, I've clearly stated my definitions.  I draw them from the dictionary.  You have failed even on this count, and you have failed to independently support your position whatsoever."
2,I love how for so many years women have fought for women's rights and we use it to kill our own children. Pretty sad. 
2,"Wow - the vote option of this web site shows something like 70% pro-abhortion.I'm shocked and sad.As for myself, I seem to be in the minority and agree with Mother Thersa (although I am not Catholic).  She said:""It is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish."""
1,"I posted below. Perhaps you didn't read  it.  The issue is not when life begins, or if there is a life at all.  The issue has to do with right of the individual to retain the right to her body.  Simply because there is another life involved doesn't resolve this issue.  If it is such a poverty that a child must die so that you may live as you wish, I would just be curious to know which child you donated your kidney to.  Or how many times you've given bone marrow so that a child may live who would otherwise die.  If you say that the government has the right to decide what to do with your body parts, you would be forced into giving away a kidney so that another might live.  If you say the government has a right to decide what you with your body parts you would be forced to endure the painful process of bone marrow transplant.  While it is indeed a sad fact that   abortion   occurs, it's only logical to say we cannot make the choice for a woman in regards to her womb.  We cannot govern another's body parts based on emotional appeals.  We cannot govern your kidney or my bone marrow based on emotional appeals that doing so will save lives.   Our bodies are ours completely.     A fetus, zygote, baby, etc. depends upon another human for life.  That woman has right to govern her body.  "
1,"I'm against the choice to:Drink and driveCommit armed robberyRapeStealMurder (publicly or privately, regardless of victim's age)SlanderTrespassLieCheatEnslaveArsonAssaultBatterand any (other) crime you can think of.of course there's always another life involved in each of these scenarios, yet they're resolved.Your error comes from the fact that boys aren't part of women.  the Y chromosome is completely foreign to them, therefore the human embryo or fetus isn't a body part; the loss of a body part always, intrinsically results in some degree of harm to the organism, the destruction of an embryo results in the ultimate degree of harm, but not to the mother, not intrinsically at least.So, if I use my hand [body part] to shoot you, you're fine with that, right?Does a man then have the right to choose what to do with his loins?You too are dependent upon another human for life; you're just not attatched by an umbilical cord.  Does that mean we have the right to decide whether you live or die?"
1,"My error?  I never said anything about chromosomes, nor mentioned anything about a whole fetus or a whole human as being a body part.  If the government has a right to govern a woman's womb (a part of her body... as in... body part), you do no retain the right to any of your body parts.    You do not retain the right to you bone marrow, nor your blood, nor one of your kidneys, as those things don't belong to you. They can be taken at will whenever the need arises because the use will save a life.   Where you get this retarded analogy of shooting me with your hand, I'm not quite sure.  And that's a very good point.   If the government has the right to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her womb, then the government also has the right to tell a man what he can and cannot do with his sperm.  If the government wants it - they'll get it because you no longer retain the rights to whatever your body produces, or sustains.  The same for the eggs of the same woman.  The very point of dependency IS the umbilical cord.  You nor I are dependent for life upon anyone else.  If we cannot survive because we are too stupid to know what to do - that is our own fault.  I do not depend upon someone else to breathe for me, feed me, keep me warm, etc. You do not depend upon anyone else for the same things.  If someone wanted to attach themselves to you for nine months in order to live, you have every right to say ""Thank you, but no.""        The rights to your body parts are immutable. This doesn't mean you can do whatever you want to with your hands.  It means no one can take it away from you.  It doesn't mean you can spit on whomever you want to, it means no one can demand that you give them your spit or face jail and fines.  It means no one can take your bone marrow from you. It means you are not responsible for giving blood.  It means you do not HAVE to give your Aunt Judy a kidney nor anyone else for that matter.  It doesn't matter if someone else will live or die based on your choice.  YOU have the immutable right to your body.   It may be crappy that a person (or a potential person) will ""die""  or just not live because you choose to retain your rights, but fortunately for you - and everyone else - you have those rights.    The rights to my womb and vagina are immutable.  The rights to you testicals and what goes on in there are immutable.  If you say that because a life is at stake that a woman does not have the right to her body or any of its parts, you say our bodies are not our own.   In which case - I you had better be registered and prepared to donate your bone marrow, and your kidney.  You should have a living will that gives away your eyes, and your heart and whatever else is salvageable in the event you're made brain dead, or it's clear you won't live.   Since you seem to be so big on this ""life"" thing, and the idea that our body parts do not belong to our own selves."
2,"I now understand what exactly proponents of   abortion   mean when they put forward this idea of ""my body, my choice.""  It had never made sense to me before, probably because I was looking more at the fetus, and less at the womb.  Now that that clarification has been made, and the position has been truly explained well, I think it will be much easier to come to an understanding.  This is certainly the best argument for abortion that I have ever heard.  I think there is an issue separating abortion and refusing to give up a kidney, and that issue is that of activity vs. passivity.  A child in need of a kidney will die unless you give it to him.  Refusing to do so would cause the child to die, but it would not be actively killing him.  Doing nothing would cause the child to die, but action would save him.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, (as it should be) for the government to require a person to take action to save a life.  An abortion, on the other hand, is actively killing the child.  Doing nothing would allow the child to live.  Taking action to ensure that another human dies, whether they are dependent upon your body parts or not, is generally illegal.  Unfortunately, there aren't many good analogies for the unique relationship a fetus has with its mother.  A possibility could be siamese twins.  I'm not sure how well this analogy will work out, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that actively killing and removing your siamese twin because she relies on your heart and she inconveniences you would be more equivalent to abortion than denying a child your kidney.  Of course, this example doesn't take into account whether a fetus is a person, which brings us right back to where we started."
1,"In the opening scene, the McManus brothers are sitting in church and then get up to kiss the feet of the crucified Christ while the Father gives a sermon.  He tells the story of how this girl was stabbed in broad daylight... ""and no one so much as called the police.""   At the end of the scene, as the brothers are walking out, he says ""Now, we must all fear evil men.  But there is another evil.. which we must fear even more.  and that is the INDIFFERENCE of good men.""    The claim that inactions are not as harmful as actions is a fallacy.  What we choose to ignore because it's an inconvenience to us to face the truth bears the same moral condemnation of the actual actions that are considered to be ""evil"", or wrong.   A woman gets an   abortion   for many reasons... mainly though, because it's inconvenient for her to be pregnant.  Why don't I donate my bone marrow? Because it's inconvenient.   I'm choosing to kill someone through my inaction. I, at the very least, recognize this.    I'll probably end up taking action and registering at some point, but at this point in my life - it's not convenient for me to do so.  For now though, I am still morally wrong for what I do NOT do, as morally a woman who aborts is wrong for what she does.  Anyway.  That's a good movie.You should rent it if you've not seen it. "
2," Under a ""veil of ignorance"", the unborn would adopt a pro-life social contract The ""veil of ignorance"" is a notion put forward by liberal philosopher John Rawls. This idea relates to the social contract people would adopt if they were effectively unborn spirits under a ""veil of ignorance"" regarding where they would ""end-up"" in life. The conclusion is that everyone would adopt a social contract that hedges against poor outcomes if they get the ""short-end of the stick"". Abortion could be considered the ""shortest stick"" (death - no life at all), so it is likely that, under a ""veil of ignorance"", the unborn would would adopt a pro-life social contract. It is notable that this social contract theory is tenant of liberal thought, and yet liberals are most supportive of abortion. There may be an inconsistency there. 
"
2,"Unfortunately, it is not relevant here.  We have already established that it is immoral to have an   abortion  , and I never said that it was moral to refuse a dying person your kidney.  Really, it's pretty cold.  Nor did I say that it was not as harmful.  In both situations, someone ends up dead.  The debate however, was not about the morality or the harmfulness of either.  It was about the government's ability to make laws.  The government cannot make laws requiring you to go out and actively save lives.  There are no ""Good Samaritan"" laws.  If there were, Ted Kennedy would be in prison, not the Senate.  Murder, the active killing of another person, on the other hand, is illegal. There might not be a moral difference, but there is a legal one.  Morality and the amount of damage done have nothing to do with it."
1,that a serial killer should be allowed to shoot as many people as he wants because he finds their lives inconvenient?
1,"While I recommend your post, what we need to consider is the notion of a justifiable homicide (i.e. self defense), which, while it rarely comes up with regard to   abortion   in the US, is nevertheless a concern.The solution is that abortion should be   legal  , just like shooting a gun, but it needs to be looked at just like any other killing.  Most abortions are murders, and the mothers are at worst accomplices - the '  doctors  ' are the murderers."
1,"You can do whatever you want to your womb, but when you start doing stuff to a fetus inside your womb, that's different.By the way, in this entire post you make this assumption: that the fetus is just part of the woman's body.Also, men's body parts are restricted.  Notably with regards to rape and gunfire: can't go sticking things anywhere one pleases, can't adjust one's fingers when there's a gun between them pointed at someone else's head.Again, you can do what you want with your body, it's when you affect someone else's body that there's a problem; and a fetus is another body: fact of biology, women don't have male genetalia as part of their anatomy, but baby boys do (even before birth)."
1,"okay.  either you didn't read it, or you don't understand it.  that's okay.   there's nothing wrong with you if you didn't.  ""you can do what you want with your body, it's when you affect someone else'se body that there's a problem; and a fetus is another body""so you've just said that there's a problem with a fetus affects another person's body.   that's the whole point.   there's a problem when a woman is forced to be affected by another person in a way she does not want.     so the fetus can do what it wants with its body, but if the woman is ill-affected and does not want to be affected at all she has the right to terminate the ""relationship"".and, you great reader, you, i've never said a fetus is part of a woman's body.  duhr.  it's IN her body and is essentially sucking her life and using HER as a means of living.  it does not matter if the fetus will live or die, but you cannot -- through use of   law   -- force a woman to be enslaved to the wants/needs of a another person.   if you force a person to do so, it is slavery.   i don't expect people to sift through hours worth of reading to find a solution, but there is a very simple one:if the fetus is determined to be viable: meaning the life could be sustained without the use of the womb, instead of an ""  abortion  "" the fetus is simply removed via c-section.   the only cost to the woman should be that comparable of an abortion until the 7th month of   pregnancy  .  at which point - the woman is being a complete douche-bag and should have to pay for the full cost of  HER treatment... but NEVER for the cost of the fetus (which is now a full-fledged baby), since she does not want the baby.    that will be covered by the state.   much like what happens when women have   children   now who don't want them, and couldn't afford them anyway... but were just ""moral"" enough to punish both our tax system and the child by giving birth and keeping it."
1,"so if someone kidnaps you, chains you in a cabin in the arctic wastes, and force feeds you, all at their own expence and inconvenience, they then have the right to 'terminate the relationship'?  to better equate the analogy, they'll hire someone to cut you up with a chainsaw, then throw the pieces out the door.So, while it's true that the smaller human affects the bigger one, the question becomes whether the child is infringing upon rights of the mother that warrant the mother's infringement upon the child's right to life.  If you believe that convenience is a just criterion for taking someone's life, then you must consistently support a serial killer's 'right to choose' as well."
1,"if viability in an arbitrary   environment   is the criterion for life, I contend then, by your logic, that you are not alive, and therefore cannot be killed.  Therefore, there can be no   legal   consequences for anyone who wishes to 'change your current environment' (i.e. the Marianas Trench).your alternative, however, is at least more reasonable than wanton termination, and so I give you some credit for that."
1,"So   doctors   and nurses have the right to terminate patients who are physically dependend upon them?What your body produces is undeniably your property, that which is sustained by your body is not, or else, anyone who's accepted my blood becomes part of my body, by your reasoning.What happens when you force someone to become dependent upon you (i.e. sex, -rape)?Body parts contd.Perhaps a better hand analogy is if someone were to hold your neck with their hand, and then skewer their hand.  They're doing what they want to their hand ..."
2,I'm confused with your argument.Are you saying that it should be   legal   or illegal?
1,"We are PRO-choice, PRO privacy.  If you have been paying attention to national polls you'd discover that a majority of Americans support a woman's right to a legal   abortion  .Abortion does not kill ""children"" it simply stops the growth of an embryo.  Denying children access to healthcare, housing, food, parents who can make a living wage is far more a case of ""murder"" than allowing a woman the right to make her own medical decisions.  It's a privacy issue and that means what another woman does is none of your business. If you want to agree with Mother Theresa, fine (she never experianced being pregnant) but to tell others who don't share your religious beliefs what they can or can't do is morally wrong.  Remember, the Catholic church always chose the fetus over the mother.  This usually left many motherless families.  Too many times the father had to put his children into orphanages because he couldn't work and take care of them.  It would have been better to let the woman live so she could be there for her other children.  This is the same church that denied woman access to birth control so they could prevent getting pregnant.  Besides, almost half of all conceptions are spontaneously aborted in the first 6-8 weeks so if God doesn't have a problem aborting embryos why should you care what a woman, who is a stranger to you, does?  I'm sure you're not willing to pay more taxes to help support all these millions more children you so insist must be brought into this world.  I usually find that the enforced pregnancy crowd are all for protecting ""the innocent fetus"" but once it's born it then becomes ""someone else's mistake"" and ""not my responsibility"".  Yeah, let's all applaud that moral stance!What I also find interesting that the Bible says nothing regarding abortion except where if a man causes a woman to abort he has to financially compensate her for the loss of the pregnancy.  If God can be so specific about what foods we are allowed to eat, when we can have sex, and what clothes we are suppose to wear, it seems odd that ""He"" was so silent on this subject. No where in the Bible does it say that ""no woman who has conceived shalt abort her conception"".  I mean, isn't God suppose to be timeless, able to see into the future, ect., ect.,?  Yet, the subject of abortion was never addressed.  The question of abortion will never be settled.  Those of us of feel it's a medical/privacy issue would rather a woman have access to a safe, legal abortion.  Your side will always consider it immoral and murder but since no one is forcing your or your daughters to have an abortion against your will I think it's a procedure that should remain legal.  Don't believe in abortion, don't have one."
1," Even if abortions ""kill life"", it can be justified as upholding a woman's life Even if a fetus is considered a ""baby"" or human life, abortions can still be justified. The ""baby"" is still not a citizen with rights, while it is in the womb. In this case, the woman's right to choose outweighs considerations of the life of the fetus. The life of the woman takes precedent over the life of the fetus. This is pro-life (pro-the-life-of-the-woman) and so respects the dignity of life.
"
1,"So if someone gets an M.D. from a diploma mill, and decides to 'draw blood' from a 'patient', then the government can't intervene, right?"
2,I agree. It's such a shame that someone would do that.Women should take responsibility for their actions.
1,A woman should have the right to choose.  Period.
2,"A pro-choice position on any issue should maximize the number of free choices, present and future. The pro-choice position on abortion fails to maximize the number of free choices because it unilaterally eliminates the future free choices of individuals aborted. The pro-life position maximizes the number of free choices because it preserves the present and future free choices of as many individuals as possible without taking away any choices arbitrarily.  "
2,"I have respect for ALL life forms, human and non-human. We as a human race need to learn to respect life forms, human and non-human, and treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve. A blastocyst is indeed life. It is a ball of rapidly dividing cells. This action causes significant energy to be spent. These cells already produce adenosine-triphosphate (ATP), thus, are biologically alive. Biological death occurs when cells can no longer produce ATP. I've known a couple of women who had C-sections 3 and 4 months premature, and the baby managed to survive. It's possible, yet it's still legal to abort during this time? OK...there's something SERIOUSLY wrong with this picture if I do say so myself. Continuing to allow this morally repulsive procedure to take place is just an indication of the state of moral decay that the USA is in and it's not going to get any better unless people with good consciences step up and straighten things out."
2,Wrong!!! ;]
2,"This is what it comes down to. Government is held with the responsibility of protecting certain unalienable, natural, inherant rights that humans are endowed with. These rights are basic and fundamental, among them are; LIFE, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. Abortion should be made illegal due to it taking the fundamental right to life from a human, the fetus. The ""  pro-choice  "" argument doesn't hold water. Choice is the foundation of freedom. You have the right to choose, SO LONG AS THAT CHOICE DOES NOT VIOLATE ANOTHER'S RIGHTS. The choice of having abortion does exactly that to the fetus, it strips a human of a fundamental right and as a consequence, EVERY single other right. More importantly, pregnancy is a choice in itself. A woman has the choice to have sex, she then has the choice of using a contraceptive; furthermore, she has a choice as to which contraceptive is used. So she has many choice, however, those choices become irrelevent once life is conceived. Pro-choicers say the woman has her civil rights violated if she cannot have an abortion. What then is it called when the innocent, who doen't have a voice to defend their own inherent rights have them violated..... It's as basic as the weight of individual rights. The fetus' right to LIFE trumps the woman's 'choice' to destroy it every single time, no exceptions. I am astounished that an organization such as the Ayn Rand Institute would abandon reason on this basic fundamental issue that rests solely upon natural rights of individuals vs. the third round of choice for a woman (after the choice to have sex and then the choice to use contraceptive)."
2,"It has always been convenient for King Henry of England to kill his newly born daughters because they were not males. It was always convenient for Germans to kill their POW during WWII. It was convenient for a father to abandon his own children. Sound bad to you. Why isn't the 97% of abortions that are not from rape, incest, of threatening life of a mother any different? "
1,"The bottom line in this debate is this:  A woman is housing the fetus. Whether or not that fetus has rights is immaterial....  the right of the woman to do with Her body as she wishes is the ultimate right.To say that the fetus has right to life is debatable, but without the woman that fetus would have no life at all.  It is her body sustaining it.If we give the right to govern our own bodies to other people, what would prevent these governing bodies from making choices that you don't agree with concerning your body parts?  There are thousands of children who have a right to life dying at this very moment from the lack of functioning kidneys.   If we had the right to tell a woman what to do with her womb, why would we not have the right to demand a kidney from a man? or a woman?  To do so would violate the man or woman's right to his or her own body, but it would save a life... and this is supposedly a justifiable reason to make such demands.Similarly, thousands of children are in need of bone marrow.  If women lose the right to govern their wombs, where is the protection of the right to govern our bone marrow?   The same reasons given to justify the ""anti-choice"" (or, ""  pro-life  ) argument are the same reasons that would make it legal to force individuals to not only register for the bone marrow transplant list, but to give one's bone marrow to the person in need of it.    Bottom line:  The right to the self is immutable, despite the most passionate objections to what another chooses to do with one's self."
1,"Betty, your argument dismisses the fact that the unborn fetus is a separate life entity. The decision to have an   abortion   is a decision to terminate not the mother's life but the life of the fetus within. You are arguing for the right to terminate someone else's life.With that said, there are many reasons why a pregnancy should not continue. Certainly when the health of the mother is at risk is one of them. If the pregnancy is as a result of rape or incest is another. And finally, like it or not, sometimes accidents happen.The problem society has is it can't seem to understand the concept of compromise. It's always an all or nothing deal. Either we don't allow abortions at all, or we allow abortion at any stage of development for any reason. But I truly believe the answer is one of compromise. During the first trimester abortion should be universally allowed. During the third trimester abortion should only be allowed to protect the health of the baby. Abortions during the second trimester should be allowed, but should be somewhat restricted (i.e., perhaps require the father's permission, or require counseling first.. something that forces the decision to be carefully reviewed, but still allow for it).It is a slippery slope, and finding the right balance is not easy. I, for one, would never ask a rape victim to carry the results of that rape. But I can never done legalizing the murder of a baby that is, in most cases, viable outside the womb."
1," There is no inviolable ""right to life"" in abortion and other cases It is clear that the notion of ""the right to life"" can sometimes be violated for certain ends. This is the case in sending soldiers to war. So as in abortion, it can be justified to kill a fetus under certain circumstances.  
"
1,"The real issue isn't when life begins, or what constitutes life. The question isn't when an   abortion   should be legal.  The real question behind abortion is the woman's right to her body. That is what I am arguing.You have failed to address the issue I have just raised.   It doesn't matter if there is a life living inside that woman, that is the woman's body.  Either she has the right to govern her own body or she does not.If the fetus can sustain its own life outside of the uterus - or science can advance itself to the point where this is possible there would be no debate.  As it stands, when you support the government's right to tell a woman what to do with her body because it ""saves a life"" you should be just as much in favor of the government forcing you give away one of your kidneys, or to undergo the painful process of bone marrow transplant even if you object. That there is a life involved in an abortion doesn't resolve the fact that this is a person's body that you are allowing government discretion over.  There is no compromise.  Either you have control over your body parts and what is done with them or you do not.  If a woman no longer wishes to host a life that is parasitic in nature and that life can survive outside the womb the medical community can help it survive.But then what?In this right to life that is supported, what kind of life are you supporting? If you are going to vote in favor of forcing women to do your bidding with her body, are you going to vote in support of using tax-payer money to support all the lives you are ""saving""?  Are you then going to vote that couples must adopt before trying to conceive through non-conventional methods (I.V.F.)?  Or should the woman then be forced to care for the child herself?  Should she be compensated for the pain and suffering that was forced upon her in the form of not only childbirth, but the physical ailments that accompany pregnancy?   Ultimately, you have to decide which is more important - your right to your body or the right for someone else to live.If you say the individual's right to his or her body is greater than the right of someone else to live, you cannot vote in favor of repealing Row/Wade.  If you say the individual has no right to his or her body when another's life is at stake, you should already have given away a kidney and donated your bone marrow for as many times as you're matched.  If you can prevent a person from dying and yet you do nothing, are you then murdering that person?.  How many people have you killed from your refusal to share your body? How many lives have I let die from my decisions to keep my kidney and my bone marrow? That some women choose to keep their uterus' (uteri?) intact through abortion isn't a separate issue. You're arguing in favor of forced sharing of body in order to save lives, so I had to ask. So which is it? Do you support the right to govern your own body?  Are you willing to be told what to do with any part of your body that can save a life?  That's the real issue. "
1,"If someone needs a kidney and I don't donate it and that person dies, I did not kill that person. I didn't do anything to help them, but nature took their life, not me.If a woman is otherwise healthy and at 26 weeks into her pregnancy she decides, for non-health related reasons, that she no longer wants the baby and has an   abortion   then she deliberately terminated that life.I'm not obligated to save a life, but I am obligated not to take one. There’s a huge difference.At some point morality needs to become the priority. Restricting late term abortions is not about dictating to a woman what she can do with her body; it's about protecting a viable human life, even if the woman wants to interpret it otherwise. Pregnancy is both a blessing and a burden for women, but it is the process decided by nature.And I’m sorry if I sound insensitive to your concerns but trust me, I am not. I merely want to find the balance between a woman’s choice and protecting human life. There is no simple answer and I understand your concern."
1,"Pardon me for pointing this out, but late term abortions already are illegal.... they Have been restricted so I'm not sure what you're arguing here.But. If you're going to speak about morality, please clear this up for me:It's immoral for a woman to have an   abortion  , or clear her body of a parasite that she does not want, but it is perfectly moral for you to ignore the impending death of the already viable, innocent life of a child. An actual child. when you have the power to save that child.  It's perfectly moral for you let a child die and not do a single thing to prevent it.  Because you're not morally obligated to save a life if you know that you can.  Did I get that right?  Morality, then, can be turned on and off according to whatever suits the mood.  Life is precious and needs to be protected at all costs - except if it will inconvenience you.  If it's another person's body, by all means...  dictate to her what she can and can not do with her body. Doing nothing is just as immoral as doing something (if you're going to use the reasoning that a woman cannot retain government over her body parts because it saves a life).    If you're going to use the ""it is the process decided by nature."" defense, how do we respond to something like a heart attack.  Is it immoral to save a woman having a heart attack? After all, it's just nature taking its course.  Should we simply watch and hope for the best? Perhaps we should just watch as the newly born baby struggles for breath.  That's nature taking its course.  We have no moral obligations to save lives, only moral obligations against taking lives....  so we should do nothing as the newborn struggles to breathe instead of clearing out the cavities and giving the baby oxygen.     Or does this seem unreasonable?  I'm thinking it sounds unreasonable.  Yet if I your reasoning, this is the conclusion that is reached.  Also, there are ""Good Samaritan"" laws which do, in fact, make it illegal to do nothing if one does, in fact, know that inaction will result in great injury or death.   Not that any judge would stretch this to include not giving blood, or not donating a kidney... but that's precisely the point.  No one can force you to do those things.Again, what that woman decides to do is her decision... regardless of the outcome... because it is her body.  To say otherwise is to deny that she, yourself, or anyone else has the right to govern their bodies.  The fact that you do nothing and the innocent child with leukemia will die because nature took its course means you knowingly let that child die.  Your body parts could have prevented it and you simply chose the other direction.  You knowingly make that choice everyday and no one calls you a murderer.  No one looks at other people standing in line in the grocery store or pumping gas and thinks ""That guy just let that kid die. What a douche!"".  It's simply easier to not think about the things that we do not do (but could be doing) to saves lives.  Why?  Because it's an inconvenience.  Yet  the logic that will morally condemn a woman who has abortion means that everyone is guilty.  There is no difference in those choices.  The choice is yours to make. No one can force you to become a marrow donor because to do so would mean that you are not free to make decisions about your body.   *even if* those decisions can ""save"" lives that might otherwise die.  "
1,"Betty, you are so badly twisting the logic that I needed to go back and read what you wrote three times and I'm still not sure I'm following along.No, you are incorrect in your interpretation of what I am saying. I'm suggesting that   abortion   is taking a life, or murder if that helps frame the argument. That is illegal. Not taking action to save the life of someone, as in any life or death situation, always has moral implications, but it’s not nearly as cut and dry as you’re trying to make it out to be. Do I risk my own life by undergoing major surgery?  Am I willing to live my life with only one kidney and, should the other be damaged by any number of things, potentially die? What if I give up my kidney and then a member of my family needs one?  I never said it was perfectly moral to sit by and do nothing when I could be saving a life, but that doesn’t mean I’m compelled to have all my spare body parts out. I do donate blood every six months and that IS saving lives. We do what we can do.  But now, let me see if I understand what you are saying. If I have this right, you're saying there is no difference between failing to donate a kidney and deliberately killing someone. They are both immoral and thus equal. Do I have this correct?You also wrote; “If you're going to use the ""it is the process decided by nature."" defense, how do we respond to something like a heart attack. Is it immoral to save a woman having a heart attack? After all, it's just nature taking its course. Should we simply watch and hope for the best?”This one I read three times and am completely lost with where you are going with this. All I was saying is ‘sorry that this is a woman only issue but that’s the way nature planned it.’. How you got from that to letting someone die from a heart attack I have no idea. The point being, if men could also carry a fetus I wouldn’t change a thing in my argument. A fetus in the third trimester is a living human being that has gone past the point of being a mere organism to a pre-born person and I believe it should have a right to life regardless of who is carrying it."
1,"Okay, then.  And if you see any mistakes please just skip over the spelling... my backspace key was ripped off through some freak accident (as was the space bar a few months ago).If you say   abortion   should be illegal - which I hear what you're saying about the late term thing, but I'll just throw it out there again that third term abortions Are illegal - you are saying people (women, men, anyone) do not have government over their own body parts.  Which means you should not have government over any of your body parts.  The fact that there is a potential life means nothing.  It would not matter if men could carry a fetus.  The fetus is literally living off the carrier.  If you had a grown person hooked up through an i.v. who would die if the cords were cut and only you could provide life to person you would still retain the right to say ""No, thank you, but I think I'm fine without you.""  This, of course, might never happen, but it is not murder to retain the use of your body as you see fit.    It is entirely within your rights.  To use your argument, sorry for the fetus, but nature designed it that the fetus couldn't live outside the womb. Not my fault.  That's just nature taking it's course.""I'm not obligated to save a life, but I am obligated not to take one. There’s a huge difference.""This is what you said.  This is why I responded that morality can't be turned on and off to suit whatever fits Your argument at the time.  Why did talk about nature? ""I did not kill that person. I didn't do anything to help them, but nature took their life, not me.""  So standing by and doing nothing is morally acceptable to you, apparently.  You're now trying to change it.  I'm not twisting anything....you're changing your words to suit yourself.But.To answer your question, you do not have that right.  If you are going to force a woman to go through a dangerous process because otherwise another person will die, it is equally moral to force anyone else to go through a dangerous process because otherwise a person will die.    Your logic says that a woman cannot retain the rights to her uterus because if she doesn't use those parts to give life, she is immoral.   By your logic, you cannot retain the rights to your body parts because if you don't use those parts to give life you are immoral.Deliberately killing someone and deliberately doing nothing and letting someone die IS the same thing.  You thought about the actions and the consequences beforehand for each of those things.  You weighed your options and made a decision.   The deciding factor in each case is you.  If all you have to do is push a button to save a life and you know it - you see it happening - you can push the button but you don't, you are deliberately killing that person.  If all you have to do is push a button and someone dies - you know this and you push it, you are deliberately killing that person.  There is no difference.  Your decision will kill a person.  ""Do I risk my own life by undergoing major surgery?""  Is there no risk in pregnancy? ""Am I willing to live my life with only one kidney and, should the other be damaged by any number of things, potentially die?""   Is there no potential for death in pregnancy? Can we not be damaged irreparably during pregnancy (I'm just assuming you're a woman. Forgive me if I'm wrong)?""What if I give up my kidney and then a member of my family needs one?""  No one has rights to their body, remember?  Someone else will be forced to give your family member a kidney.""I never said it was perfectly moral to sit by and do nothing when I could be saving a life, but that doesn’t mean I’m compelled to have all my spare body parts out.""  Well, actually you did say that you were obligated to save a life.  But that aside,  why should a woman be compelled to use her body parts to sustain the life of someone else if she doesn't want to so?So, I've answered your question but you've yet to answer *the* question:Do you have the right to govern your own body?That's the only answer you need to give in this argument and that's the only one I'm asking you to answer.  It doesn't matter if we're talking about forced birth or the forced donation of kidneys or bone marrow.  It's not a debate that those things ""save"" lives.  Do you have the right to govern your own body?This isn't a woman's issue for this very reason.  If abortion is illegal, not only is it women who don't have the right to govern their bodies, but it follows that all people do not have that right.  So which is it?"
1,"Apparently you are familiar with this ruling.  You say that during the first trimester   abortion   should be universally allowed, some restrictions in the second and even more in the third.  Well, this is exactly what Roe states.  Third trimester abortions are only allowed if the mother's life or health are in grave danger or if the fetus has such tremendous health problems it wouldn't live beyond birth but what few abortions are performed in the last trimester are usually to save the life of the woman.  So you see, compromise already exists.  Also, a fetus can not be a seperate entity until it is able to function outside of the womb.  This can't happen until about the 29th week.  Granted, there have been cases of 26-28 week deliveries but these usually result in very physically and mentally damaged children.  If a fetus delivers and doesn't take a spontaneous breath, the physicians usually won't try to resuscitate it because it means the respiratory system is too immature to function.  They don't want to put that child through any torture forcing it to try and live.  I've seen the miserable lives those children have gone through and was thankful when they finally died from all their medical complications.  Death is a normal part of life.  From the moment we are concieved we are on the path that will eventually end in our death.  It may come a few weeks after conception or years after our birth but it will happen.  Let's take care of those who are born and here in need of our help.  We don't need to drag more unwanted children into this world until we can give the one's living here and now a decent life."
2,"I know it is a ""lapsus"" but i couldn't resist: ""During the third trimester   abortion   should only be allowed to protect the health of the baby"" How is abortion going to protect the life of the baby, i wonder? Seriously: i am against all abortion (and this is my opinion) because it simply terminates the life of a human being's life cycle. Science has proved that this cycle begins at conception and ends permanently with death. I simply think it's wrong to make a distinction of humans based on any discimination as declared in the universal declaration of Human rights article2: Size, Location, Stage of development, etc... To argue that a fetus is not human is simply false.If we agree with this we have to give all humans the same rights. The only exception to abortion, in my opinion, has to be when the life of the mother is at risk.This is to save the only life who would survive if we didn't intervene."
1,"Thanks for catching that. Yes, that should have read ""..to protect the health of the mother"".Don't get me wrong, ussitano, I'm not in favor of abortions at all for the same reasons you give. But the reality of it is we will never end abortions; there are just too many legitimate reasons why society wants and needs to have them. I would never want a woman who was raped to be forced to carry to term a pregnancy that may result from that attack. This also applies in cases of incest. And if we know a fetus is severely deformed, I can also understand the desire to terminate it. I'm a little less understanding of those who simply failed to use protection and now think of it as an inconvenience. However, prior to 28 weeks the embryo/fetus is not considered viable and so if there are reasons to end the pregnancy, I'd prefer to allow it then with the understanding that beyond 28 weeks   abortion   would be extremely restricted.To those who claim this is already the case I would point out every piece of legislation that attempts to restrict late term abortions has more loopholes than carter has pills. And while the percentage of abortions in the third trimester is low, when you consider the total number of abortions for any given year, it's still a very large number of viable fetuses that are being terminated every year. There is far too much ambiguity in the laws today and the differences in various state laws allow people to simply go to a state that will allow them."
2,"To those in favor of   abortion  , please go to this site and watch the video. It's graphic, and disgusting, but many have not seen this side of abortion. Look at those little children, and tell me, honestly tell me, that abortion is A-Okay.   http://www.abortionno.org  /"
1,"Late term abortions are rare and only to save the life of the woman.  So it's graphic, so is the end results of bombs being dropped on innocent women and children in Iraq.  It still doesn't address the issue of privacy.  Abortions aren't for public viewing.  You can use shock all you want but it's not going to work on everyone.  The question of   abortion   is still a privacy/medical decision.  You don't believe in abortion, no one is forcing you to have one.  We aren't living in China.  You want to have 20 kids, that's your choice and I wouldn't insist that laws must be passed forcing you to limit the size of your family.  By the same reasoning, you have no right to tell other people how many children they must have.  "
1,"It is hypocritical to protect fetuses but send men to die in war. Rick Claro - ""George W. Bush will protect your unborn fetus, then send your grown child to die in war.""[6] This is a common argument that undermines the notion of ""the sanctity of life"" and the notion that it is ""inviolable"". Clearly, in war, humans frequently justify killing other human beings.

2,Ew gross that was so sad!
1,I believe that there should be a difference between   abortion   when the sex that created the child was consensual or if the woman was raped. If she was raped and became pregnant the woman should then be able to decide for herself but if she was just to lazy to make some guy put on a condom then she should have to go through with it. No one knocked her up agianst her will.
2,"I see a trend that has become a thorn to the people of America. The trend is that of the courts generating law, be it a regional court, or the so called ""Supreme Court""! From all of my study, the function of the court system, as well as that of the Supreme Court is to uphold ""Law"" which has been legislated by the ""House of Parliament""...thus representing the People of America... instead of a group's opinion being honored by a biased supreme court judge. To me this represents supreme corruption and misuse of judicial power which should be indictable or impeachable.Law for the people need to be legislated through the House, representing the PEOPLE, for the PEOPLE, and of the PEOPLE, to be upheld by the court system and especially the Supreme Court system which should directly represent the HOUSE, in keeping it real.Here is one major flaw that I hope the New President can bring back to sanity, putting the laws of the land back into representing Democracy and of the people.The Supreme court system as it stands has become a means for biased minority groups to perpetrate their agenda by finding a judge of similar bias. Democracy is meant to represent theNations collective good and common sense and not that of the few in a building of a few people. (Court house).            "
1,"From CanadaThe Roe vs Wade decision said that founding fathers/people who made the constitution had a intention to say the fetus is not a human being and future Americans can never say its a human being.The Roe decision is based on the sole foundation the fetus is not a human being.This was the error of roe.Not liberal, activist Judges as such. Though motives are involved.Roe literally tries to say a very Protestant Christian British population created a constitution where  then and later legislatures could not vote that the fetus is a human being.Therefore the old ones intended the people of the future could not change their minds about the fetus and that at the creation of the constitution they believe the fetus was not a human being.This ia an absurdity.Such a early religious people never would put in their ultimate collection of rights the denial that a fetus has no soul and is not human until birth.They never had such a intent.They never would of agreed to such two concepts.Roe tries to stop the people from voting up or down   abortion  .Roe says abortion was settled hundreds of years ago.Roe admits there is no final conclusion on the humanity of the fetus.Roe concludes the fetus is not a human being.Roe hints a common opinion that the fetus is a human being could find its place in the constitution apparently nullifying a right to abortion. The right seems conditional.Roe was a careless opinion and carelessly allowed to exist because of the pro-abortion beliefs of the layers generally.Destroying Roe's legal credibility is not a big problem. pro-lifers just need better lawyers acting in these small circles."
2,"I have tried and tried and I can not come to the rationalization that many pro-  abortion   supporters find so easy - that somehow, a thing that, if left un-aborted, will turn into a human being 100% of the time.  (not usually, not almost always, not 99.9999999...% of the time, but EVERY time) can be killed and it somehow isn't murder, or if it is, that it is OK, because it isn't human.  How can it not be a human being? This isn't about religion or choice, but about science (the thing that becomes a human, is  a human) and basic right and wrong vs. convenience.  I don't have to be a woman (I'm not) or a religious nutbag (I'm not) to understand either side of this argument.  Why do so many otherwise decent people seem to think it is OK to kill another human?  It also sickens me that many of the same folks that are pro-abortion are charter members of PETA, ASPCA, etc.  If we cared half us much for each other, as we did for food and companionship, abortion wouldn't be an issue.

Of course not!  You never consented to the contract!Imagine the following situation.  One day, you wake up and find a human being attached to you via life-support system.

2,"Rape counts only for less than 1% of total abortions. Rape clearly is an exception.Why can't we discuss about the main problem and then address the exceptions?The problem with   abortion   these days is that it has become simply another method of birth control.This is the main problem and one everybody should agree with: abortion is not good for women, nor for   society  . We should fight the basic problem that is unwanted   pregnancy  . And i am sorry but the pope is right: Condoms only policy does not work: we need a better sexual   education  . I really believe in the ABC system used in Africa: Abstinence, Be Faithful, Condoms:Abstinence until you find a partner, better sexual practices and use of birth control methods. As   condoms   are not 100 % reliable, to advertize that the problem to   HIV   and unwanted pregnancy is solved using condoms will not be effective."
1,"Wait a second. Do you have any evidence when you say that rape counts for less than 1% of total abortions? I'd like to see those statistics, please.And do you have any evidence of the claim that   abortion   is being used as another method of birth control? That's ridiculous. Abortions are far more expensive than   condoms   and pills.And condoms are always more effective than unprotected sex. I agree that the solution to   HIV   and unexpected pregnancies is better sex education, but I don't see how that discredits abortion as a possibility. The best way to treat a broken leg is by not breaking it in the first place, but you can't discount surgery as an option to mend broken legs."
1,"In a free society, abortion is truly a matter of personal belief.  The issue of abortion debates the question of whether or not the unborn child is a human being, or at what point it becomes so. This question cannot be answered for the collective body of society, rather should be answered by the individual based on personal and religious beliefs. If an individual believes that an unborn child is a human being, then the ""right to life"" term can be justified by that individual for their own personal choice. If an individual believes that the unborn child is not a human being, then there is no justification for laws to prohibiting an abortion. Therefore It should be argued that this is an issue for the individual; that an individual seeking an abortion has their own responsibility to be informed thoroughly about the matter, but should never be forced to agree or disagree.

2,"""Fifty-four percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method (usually the condom or the pill) during the month they became pregnant. Among those women, 76% of pill users and 49% of condom users report having used their method inconsistently, while 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users report correct use.[9]• Forty-six percent of women who have abortions had not used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant. Of these women, 33% had perceived themselves to be at low risk for   pregnancy  , 32% had had concerns about contraceptive methods, 26% had had unexpected sex and 1% had been forced to have sex.[9]""  http://www.alanguttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.html  The AGI is the research arm of Planned Parenthood, the world's largest   abortion   provider. So as you can see 46% of women did not use another contraceptive method while a majority of people using other contraceptive methods report having used them inconsistently. This means that a great majority of people are not using contraceptives or are using them inconsistently. Why? Because there's always abortion available as a solution.The AGI also reports that 1% had been forced to have sex.Of course   condoms   are more effective than unprotected sex. I don't say that better sexual   education   discredits abortion as a possibility. I just think that if we address the problem at the source then less abortion will follow wich is what we should all agree with. I also think that making abortion illegal is the best solution if we want abortion to end.In poland for instance since the new 1993 law was written abortions went down from 100 000 aprox to only 340 in 2006. The law exempt the woman from being guilty of any   crime   and allows abortion when there is rape, if the life or   health   of the mother is at risk or when the fetus health is incompatible with life.Your example is not valid because in a broken leg situation surgery has a purpose of   healing   and cure. In the case of abortion surgery is used to terminate a human life. No other surgery does that."
1,"The question isn't whether   abortion   ought to be legal but rather - In the United States, and indeed throughout the rest of the world, does a human being have the right of self-determination and, at least in the United States, the liberty to exercise that right. This question, of course, was resolved a long time ago in the writing of the U.S. Constitution. It was answered affirmatively in the bill of rights in which the right of self-determination and the liberty to exercise that right is inherent in freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom to bear arms, etc. The intent of those who composed the constitution is quite clear - unquestioned right of self-determination and liberty to exercise the same. None of these rights and freedoms are possible without that basic assumption. If the tribe - and this is in effect how the nation behaves on a regular basis - chooses to interfere with a woman's right to control the functions of her own body, the tribe undermines the basis of all other individual freedoms thus destroying the heart of U.S. law - those principles written into the U.S. Constitution. If a woman's right to self-determination is undermined, so too you undermine freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, economic freedom, right to private property, and on and on. I believe the majority of Americans, particularly those arguing against the legality of abortion, do not fully understand what they are tampering with. They are, in fact, themselves inserting the wedge that will topple their right to ask and decide such questions in their own personal lives. It is but a short step from disallowing the right to choose abortion to legal control over when and if a woman has a child at all. If a woman does not absolutely own her womb, she at some point will be told when she can and cannot have a child, with whom, how many and how often. This sounds extremist, of course, however, this is the very real logical destiny called for by those who would destroy a woman's right to choose. If a woman cannot decide NOT to bear a child, she also cannot decide when she WILL have a child. The tribe reduces a woman to a mere walking womb belonging to the people.If the tribe refuses to allow a woman to decide to abort a fetus, then the tribe must necessarily take responsibility for that fetus. It necessarily become property of the people thus reducing a fetus/child to a thing for barter. It stands to reason, if you compel tribal decisions on an individual, the tribe is responsible for the consequences of those decisions, NOT the individual. Also, by promoting the fetus to the status of ""full human being"", you create a situation where you impose slavery on the mother to the fetus - the slavery of one full human being to another full human being. We, as americans, no longer legally support slavery and therefore, to be consistent, must do all that is possible to liberate the mother from slavery to that ""full human being"" growing inside her. The child MUST be removed and allowed to survive on its own. After all, it's a ""full human being"", is it not? If it is a crime for an individual to move into the home of another uninvited and forcibly take up residence, it is also a crime for a a fetus allegedly with full rights and liberties to be allowed to reside in a mother unwelcome. The rights of the ""fully human"" fetus cannot supersede the rights of the mother. If they are equal, the desires of each must be considered equally. The mother does not want the unwelcome guest. If the tribe decides to make decisions for that unwelcome guest, the tribe must necessarily resolve the situation of illegal residence - otherwise the tribe loses all legitimacy in its interference in the decisions of the pregnant woman and her right to decide for herself is restored by default.If the tribe condones slavery, the tribe has no legitimacy."

She has to carry it for nine months(should she choose to have it). The man is irrelevant in this situation. The choice is and should only be the mother's.

1,"This post by the ARC is just the tip of the ice burg.  If I understand the argument, the full argument involves the view that a person's right to life involves the right to live it by their own judgment of how best to do so. Since a fetus has no such judgment it has no right to live by it, just as it has, with some exceptions clearly spelled out in law, no right to on the food he/she eats, or the TV shows watched, or the education it receives.  The age of  majority is the recognition of the fact that person-hood and the full support and weight of the law is reserved for those who have developed the capacity and ability, as far as the law is concerned, for reasoned judgments about how best to lead their own lives.  This is the source of a woman's right to have an abortion.  "
1,"Abortions should be legal. To make   abortion   illegal is to deny a woman's individual rights. Whether a woman has an abortion is entirely up to her.  This is an issue of individual rights. If an individual's right is denied or violated, that individual is not free.   To the extent that all women are denied their individual rights, to that extent the nation is not free. When that's the case, males are also affected.  In time, the entire nation is under the dictates of whoever has the most pull and the most guns. The state and church should not interfere with this right. Both government and religious leaders have no moral say in the matter of abortion.  A woman might want to consult with the father of the pregnancy to discover his preferences but ultimately she alone has the final choice. It is, after all, HER life. She should be free to live it as she chooses. Abortions should be legal. "
2,"This is an issue of individual rights. However, a woman does not have the right to terminate a life, regardless of whether it is inside her body or not. The fetus also has a natural right, to life. If this is not so, then the mother does not have a natural right to life either. One cannot say one human being has more of a right to life than another. What makes this even worse is we all have a right to make our own choices. The mother who terminates her pregnancy had a host of choices that would have prevented the pregnancy, the fetus never had a choice. The fetus' choice is made for them. This is a form of tyranny, as the voiceless does not is not given a choice of freedom.Denying a woman an   abortion   is not to deny her an individual right. She does not have the right to terminate her pregnancy and destroy human life, it is a choice not a right. She has a right to make choices, choices that would have prevented the pregnancy.You are right, she is free to live as she chooses. However as Rand said, ""a private individual is legally free to take any action he pleases (so long as he does not violate the rights of others)"".Abortion is an example of the lack of individual responsibility that is being bred into our culture. We have all these rights and don't want the responsibility that comes with exercising them. When the ultimate individual responsibility we will ever have (to that of our offspring) can be neglected and the decision made which leads to this can be accepted with no recourse, our society is degenerating. Creating life (reproduction) is the ultimate gift that has been given to all living things and to demean that gift and take it for granted can do nothing but harm. Abortion is morally wrong, biologically wrong, ethically wrong, and violates all natural rights humans have been endowed with. It is truly one of the largest violation of human rights the world has ever seen and since the abortion movement (Planned Parenthood) systematically targets poor minorities, I would claim it is borderline genocide.   http://www.blackgenocide.org/black.html  "
1,"ajligs wrote and I quote: “The fetus also has a natural right, to life.”No. A fetus has no rights. “Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generating action.” (Ayn Rand) Simply because a thing is alive does not give it rights. Many things are alive, including insects, weeds and algae. One does not attribute rights to such things.  Individual rights have a specific meaning and it applies only to human beings.  A fetus is totally dependent on its host.  It cannot think or act without its host.  It is not a human being until the moment of birth.“A right is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social context.” (Ayn Rand)   The born have a right to exist because they are born.  Not vice versa. The pregnant woman has a right to abort because she has the right to life.  The fetus has no such right.ajligs wrote, and I quote: “the fetus never had a choice.” This is true. It cannot have a choice because it has no capacity to choose. It cannot think.  It has no power of volition because it is not a self-sustaining, independent entity.Your entire argument is based on a mistaken premise that a fetus is a human being. Since you believe that, you give it rights.  But a human being refers to a specific living organism of a specific kind. By definition a human being is “a rational animal.”  But a fetus is not rational. It is impossible for a fetus to be rational before birth. It does not yet have a mind. It has no means to form a mind. As best it is a parasite.  It may look human after a certain development, but it is not yet human until it has an independent conceptual consciousness, i.e., until it is born.  Rights may not be attributed to the non-human. Women have individual rights.  Fetuses do not. Abortion should be legal."
1,"Interesting argument Sylvia; technically filled with many errors, but interesting.What evidence do you have that a fetus can not think? Later term fetuses definitely exhibit brain activity.A fetus most definitely has human DNA. It has a heartbeat. It has a brain and brain activity. It is, in scientific terms, every bit as much human as you are.You are correct when you say a human being refers to a specific living organism of a specific kind. That specific kind is determined by its DNA. Fetuses are living, and they have human DNA. That makes them human.By what basis or by what evidence do you make the observation that a fetus has no mind, or that it has no independent conceptual consciousness? Please provide the evidence to support that comment. What is the magical transformation that takes place in a matter of seconds that transforms a parasite into a human being?A human fetus, from as early as 21 weeks into development, is a fully functional human being. From that point forward they continue their growth and development to improve their chances of surviving on their own outside the womb. But that does not mean that they do not have everything that is required to live on their own at 21 weeks. Your argument is based on very simplistic terms; if you can’t touch it, and you can’t see it with your own eyes, then it’s nothing more than a parasite. This makes it easier to morally justify terminating it, but it does nothing to change the facts that any   abortion   that is performed after 21 weeks is terminating a life that could very well have survived and gone on to a full, normal life and do great things.If you’re really interested in the subject and not just trying to make excuses for why it’s OK to abort a fetus at any point of it’s development I would recommend the following site for an interesting read;     http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/tul/psychtoday9809.html  "
1,"Dear Pepper:You asked: ""What evidence do you have that a fetus can not think? Later term fetuses definitely exhibit brain activity.""Brain activity is not thought. Every organism that has a brain, has brain activity. Cats have brain activity. So do rats and birds and dolphins and so forth. Brain activity per se is not the defining characteristic of thought. Thought is a complex set of identifications and integrations of two or more percepts, which means thought requires some perception of that which exists independent of one's own consciousness.  A fetus inside a womb has no material to be conscious of. One cannot be conscious when there is nothing to be conscious of. The evidence that a fetus cannot think lies in how it must function. By its nature, it relies on its host.  If, for instance, the host smokes or drinks, we know ""out here"" that this is not good for the fetus ""in there,"" but the fetus does not know that such things are bad for it. It cannot identify or evaluate the things the host sends to it.  It can only passively absorb what the host gives it. You wrote: ""A fetus most definitely has human DNA. It has a heartbeat. It has a brain and brain activity. It is, in scientific terms, every bit as much human as you are.""Not true.  A fetus does have the things you mentioned but none of it adds up to the human.  Human DNA or a heartbeat or brain activity are not defining characteristic of a human being.  The essential defining characteristic of a human being is conceptual consciousness. DNA is the building block of the physical organism, which includes the brain. You wrote: ""You are correct when you say a human being refers to a specific living organism of a specific kind. That specific kind is determined by its DNA. Fetuses are living, and they have human DNA. That makes them human.""No. As I indicated above, when one is discussing the human, one must consider the essential that differentiates the human from other mammalian life forms, which is rationality. The human is the rational animal. The rational animal alone has a conceptual consciousness.You asked: ""By what basis or by what evidence do you make the observation that a fetus has no mind, or that it has no independent conceptual consciousness? Please provide the evidence to support that comment.""I've already answered this above. You asked: ""What is the magical transformation that takes place in a matter of seconds that transforms a parasite into a human being?""There is no magic involved. The transformation involves essentially two fundamentals: existence and development.  Ordinarily, at a particular stage of its physical development, a mammalian organism is ejected from its host. At that moment, it is plunged into the entire array of things that make up the universe, including light and gravity and objects and so forth. The born organism cannot immediately perceive everything available to him. It takes considerably longer than a few seconds to ignite the operation of his consciousness. Upon birth it is still on the pleasure-pain principle.  He can sense discomfort and hunger and will react.  The fetus has a potential.  When it is born into a different environment, that potential is activated. But it takes him quite some time to learn to focus his eyes.  It takes even longer for him to sense that the object looking at him is ""good for me.""  It takes even longer for him to SAY ""mama.""  This is the nature of the development of a consciousness from the perceptual to the conceptual, which is unique to human beings. A conceptual consciousness cannot begin to function until it has material to be conscious of. It cannot have access to that material until its perceptual mechanism is activated and utilized.  It cannot activate and utilize the perceptual mechanism until it is born into an environment where there is material to perceive and be conscious of. So, we say: the fetus upon being born is now in an environment that supplies him with perceptual data, which enables him to develop his conceptual consciousness.  Ergo, he is now human. You wrote: ""Your argument is based on very simplistic terms . . .but it does nothing to change the facts that any   abortion   that is performed after 21 weeks is terminating a life that could very well have survived and gone on to a full, normal life and do great things.""Are you saying that if a fetus is terminated before 21 weeks, that's okay. You know it won't do great things.  But if it's terminated after 21 weeks, then you know that one is killing something that might do great things?In any case, this does not deal with the most important issue: A woman's individual rights. Why should a pregnant woman do what you want her to do?  Why should her rights be violated?  Why do you advocate using force upon human beings in the name of the human?  It does not make sense.  Abortion should be legal because it acknowledges and affirms a woman's individual rights. "
2," Uncertainty over whether fetuses are ""life"" should halt abortions. There are strong arguments in favor of fetuses being life from conception and some strong arguments against. At a minimum, uncertainty about the ""truth"" should cause us to place a moratorium on abortions until we figure it out.
"
1,"Sylvia,So are you suggesting that cats, rats, birds and dolphins do not think?  You ought to be more careful as it’s a scientific fact that these animals all do think, and in the case of dolphins, might very well think more than humans do.Your argument is defining the differences between a ‘human person’ and a ‘human being’. A human person is a human being that is now interacting with its environment. It has a name, a personality, behavioral patterns, likes and dislikes, skills, etc. A human person is one you can touch and see and feel. A human being is a human person who hasn’t yet had the chance to establish themselves. It is a biological entity that has yet to develop into a 'person'. Physiologically speaking, there is no difference. Placing a fetus in an environment that gives it more external stimulation to respond to does not make it any more human than if it stayed in the womb. By your definition, if a doctor removes a 28 week old fetus from the womb and places it in a nursery it is now a human. However, if a baby is born naturally and immediately placed inside an empty, dark, windowless room it is still not human as it’s not interacting, learning and evolving from its environment. That’s just silly. A fetus can not control the environment it’s in nor should it be judged human or not by it’s location. An unborn fetus has just as much ability to learn and interpret from its environment as one that has been born; they just reside in different environments.Regardless of whether we will agree on this point or not, if you read at the link I provided you will see that fetuses in the womb are in fact very active and reacting to their surroundings. They respond to touch, to sound and even to light. They are human beings who just happen to be living in the protective cover of their mother’s womb, but whether in the womb or out, they are physically the same.You asked: “Are you saying that if a fetus is terminated before 21 weeks, that's okay. You know it won't do great things. But if it's terminated after 21 weeks, then you know that one is killing something that might do great things?”I use 21 weeks as a reference because that’s the point in a fetus’s development that it begins to stand a chance of surviving outside the womb. My position, as stated from the start, is one of compromise; a woman should have the right to decide whether she wants to be pregnant or not and be able to terminate the pregnancy if that’s her choice. However, at some point the embryo/fetus developing inside her reaches a point where they are considered viable, and from that point forward I prefer to protect their right to live. I would prefer never having to take a life, so no, it’s not okay with me to abort fetuses less than 21 weeks. However, I do understand the need for allowing abortions, hence a solution based on compromise. But just remember, every great human who has ever lived was, at some point and time, a fetus less than 21 weeks into development. You prefer to frame   abortion   as nothing more than a woman’s individual rights but in doing so you trivialize the human life growing within her. It’s obvious to me that this is why so many people who favor unrestricted abortion rights spend so much time arguing that the unborn fetus isn’t a human life. However, by all scientific definitions it is a human life and at some point its right to live should supersede a woman’s right to abort it.You wrote: “Abortion should be legal because it acknowledges and affirms a woman's individual rights.” But what you’re really saying is “Abortion should be legal because it acknowledges and affirms a woman's individual rights, including the right to kill another human being”. "
1,"Dear Pepper:You asked: ""So are you suggesting that cats, rats, birds and dolphins do not think?""Yes. I don't merely suggest it. I affirm it with full conviction.You wrote: ""You ought to be more careful as it's a scientific fact that these animals all do think, and in the case of dolphins, might very well think more than humans do.""Your assertion is not an argument---nor is it persuasive. Your allusion to ""scientific fact"" is of the same type.But I am curious to know why you believe the lower animals can think.  Have you read an article written by a rat? Have you observed cats working to send a man to the moon?  Or maybe a chimp worked at your computer for a while where it accessed the net and discussed with an MIT professor the dangers of government interference in the economy? I'm not being facetious.  I'm quite serious. I am trying to stress that a process of thought is far different from a beaver making a dam prompted by his biological programming---and so forth in regard to all the other activities the lower animals engage in.  None of that is thought. Nor is thought the response to stimuli. A different process is involved when, say, we discuss our differing points of view.  I could not hold this discussion with any of the lower animals. Why do you think that is?  Is it merely because you and I share the same language?  Or is something else involved? For example, suppose we are in the same room and in silence I point to a chair. You would know immediately what that object was.  And if I also pointed to a dining table, you would again know what I was pointing to.  Then suppose I stated, ""I need more furniture."" You would know instantly that what I meant was I need another chair, or a bed or a side table.  This is an example of concept formation.  It is an abstract process that is unique to man because only we have the kind of consciousness required to do that kind of mental work.As for the rest of your comments, I regret to say I do not agree with anything you wrote.  As I said before, I do not consider a fetus a human being.  Consequently I cannot agree with your statements, which all follow from that premise. I do not consider it virtuous to compromise on the principle of individual rights.  I do not accept the initiation of force as a proper mode of civilized, moral conduct. Of all your assertions the one most grievously horrific is your statement that a fetus ""at some point its right to live should supersede a woman's right to abort it."" This says that a woman's rights should be at the mercy of whoever decides what that point is.  Would you enjoy having a  ""right"" that is conditional upon how much time an egg spends in your womb? Perhaps you would consider it your duty to give birth, since someone else says you must?  In any case, a ""conditional right"" is not a right at all. It is the wholesale destruction of individual rights. "
1,"I think   abortion   should be legalized because of the simple fact that woman have the right not to be pregnant wether it be an accidental thing with her partner, or being raped. I meen who in this god forsaken planet would want to live with the knoledge that the baby she is about to have is the son of a complete stranger who had raped her, but hey im just a just a 9th grader and i dont know verry much about this subject, but all i do know is that i think it is right and i am all for abortion."
2,"Hello there.Just some food for thoughts:You say that the woman have the right not to be pregnant. I agree with you. Let's take the rape victims out of the equation for a moment (they count for less than 1% of all abortions).How does a woman get pregnant? By having sex with a man. What is the possible outcome of a etherosexual sexual intercourse (as there are no 100% birth control methods) ? A new life. As we all are entitled to assume the responsability of our actions, shouldn't we expect the mother that chose to have sex to now take care of this new life that bears no responsability in existing?Now for the rape victims: as told these abortions count for less than 1% of the total.My thought here is that in the rare case a woman gets pregnant in a rape she has suffered a disgusting violation of some of her most valued rights. To discover to expect a child from the man who raped you must be very hard to accept. This said, we have to ask ouselves this question: how is an   abortion   going to help forget the trauma, isn't it even worse to have an abortion? Wouldn't it remind the patient of the terrible thing that happened to her?. Isn't this abortion going to add a new sense of guiltiness on the victim? To abort in a case of a rape is to kill an innocent human being by the less human method available while to retain the baby is to give birth to a new life. Wich choice will help the mother live better after this terrible experience?"
1,"Ok, if a mother decided to take   abortion  , does that mean killing a human being? Consider this > I have the right to take the life of a mouse, ants, or even a micro-organism that does not even count(unprotected   animals  ), right? and consider this > so if i do not have the right to take a life of a human being, why is it that im allowed to take the life of a human being partly? for example, some of the person's cells are killed when the person is doing an X-ray test. The same goes if i poked someone lightly. What happened when the egg in the mother's womb is fertilised? Does that mean life? what if somehow i killed the fertilized egg at that particular moment? Does that mean i murdered and therefore i committed a   crime  ? well, what if i killed the sperm and the egg seperately? it's still ending a life. As i mentioned earlier, if i poked someone, it means killing some of his cells. But why is it that it's not a crime? the reason is maybe that it's minor, these cells almost has no benefit to that person and therefore it makes almost no loss. Its not the same if a ran into a man and purposely decapitated his arms. I will be sent to jail. Now lets go back to abortion. If the mother feels that the child only cause trouble for her.(cases such as financial problem, time, etc.) It also means that the   baby   has almost no benefit to the mother. I know, it means ""something"" to the baby. But consider this > if i cloned an animal(which is illegal), the animal's cell/dna or whatever is needed for this. so if i killed it, does it also mean killing some of the animal's cell which has no benefit at all? Every human being has individual rights of their own body. if it is allowed to kill a sperm because the father have the right, and kill an egg because the mother have the right. Surely it is allowed to kill when the egg fertilizes as the parents have the right? "
2,"""That's what   abortion   would be, if the fetus were a person""You assume this without any arguments, when this is the very point we must discuss to accept any kind of abortion or not at all.The big question here is this: Since   science   as proved that the life of every   baby   begins at some point before birth (and there you have the countless premature   babies   to prove it), when does this new human life begins to exist?"" and the other question: Since all newborn babies are entitled to the right to life what are the ""properties"" that make them human persons and that fetus don't?What is necessary here is to use all available knowledge of science, phylosophy and any subject available to give an answer to those two questions. And with the best answers we can obtain with the knowledge we have nowadays to decide first weather abortion should be morally accepted and seconddly if abortion should be   legal   or not."
2,"And while   pro-life   all give the same answer: life begins at conception, all human beings are also human persons, the   pro-choice   side has no official answer. This fact bears a consequence: while the pro-life answer gives a concrete solid starting point, the pro-choice side is at any rate incoherent within itself. Allowing   abortion   will always lead to kill what, for some of the pro-choice advocates, is a human being and with a right to life. My point is: since we cannot apparently reach a common definition on when a human being should be recognized as such and consequently respected it's right to life, shouldn't we take as answer the most   safe   of all which is at conception just in case?Example: if we go   hunting   with a friend and we hear the sound of what seems a stag shouldn't we double check if it isn't our friend instead, and if we cannot reach a conclusion not to shoot?"
2,"Your statement that the embryo during the first trimester is pre-human is your opinion, devoid of any religious teachings or thoughts of the rights of that fetus. The woman who becomes pregnant (in the vast majority of cases) is responsible for her condition--either because she was irresponsible about taking precautions, ignorant of what could happen when she had unprotected sex, or simply considers abortion a form of birth control. Personally, I felt protective of any of my children from the first moment I knew that I was pregnant, and I was already aware of their humanity. Another possibility is that many minor girls are forced by their parents or boyfriend to have an abortion when they don't want one. What about their rights?However, you sidestep the real problem. Many abortions are performed AFTER the first trimester--right up until the baby is viable outside the womb--including by partial-birth abortions. How any morally aware person can approve of killing infants that can feel pain and are capable of sustaining life outside the womb is incomprehensible to me. Yet millions of women do it, while at the same time many parents are courageously fighting to keep their prematurely born infants alive by the technology available today?I grant that a woman has the right to decide she doesn't want the child she was ""usually"" responsible for conceiving, but that is what adoption is for. There are untold couples who cannot have children standing in line to receive that baby. Plus, most women who decide to have an abortion never think about what physical or emotional harm that it may cause them in the future. Maybe they will be unable to conceive when they decide they do want a child. Maybe they will survive from the guilt they felt when/if they saw the dead fetus removed from their body."
1,"A fetus is a potential human being, not an actual human being. Therefore, it has no rights. End of story. Whether it can feel ""pain,"" have a heartbeat, or have ""brainwaves"" is completely irrelevant and constitute irrational criteria made up on the spot by neurotic religionists with an axe to grind against secularism and naturalism. A fetus is an incompletely formed, biologically dependent proto-human. Emotions and religious doctrines have nothing to do with reality whatsoever.

It is different than an infant in these respects:- size: a 24 week old in neonatal care is smaller than a 39 week old still in the womb- development: a 24 week old in neonatal care is less developed than a 39 week old still in the womb- environment: a 24 week old in neonatal care may be breathing air with lungs, but probably has a feeding tube (i.e. umbilical cord) but is otherwise identical to a 39 week old still in the womb- dependency: a 24 week old in neonatal care is 100% dependent on a caregiver, just like a 39 week old in the womb, but the care is administered differentlyFor these reasons, I draw the conclusion that as soon as science can detect the organism growing inside a woman’s body, it is a life.  As soon as science can detect the major attributes of a person (from fingernails to DNA), it must be a person.  To my knowledge, no pregnancy has ever resulted in anything but a person, thus empirical science concludes that all human pregnancies must be of persons.To continue the debate, let's further your position that birth defines life (in this case life = humanity = personhood = legal protection).  Given partial-birth abortion (dilation and extraction), at what exact point is a fetus born?  Is this different for vaginal births and cesarean births?"
1,"Very well put; I completely agree.  I will simply add that it is dangerous to cite charateristics as criterion, except those which are universally specific, i.e. DNA."
1,"Does science detect that a fetus is metaphysically independent? No. Again, a potential is not an actual. Your criteria are completely arbitrary, nonfundamental, and do not survive the light of reason.Partial-birth abortion is an oxymoron invented by religionists to add legitimacy to their cause. An abortion is not a birth. A physician pulling a fetus out of the birth canal does not constitute a birth.In actual childbirth, the laws of nature induce a biological process which expels an organism fully developed to function autonomously - in a metaphysical sense.Exotic, borderline, or abnormal cases do not define the principle or category. The existence of Cesarean births does not in any way change the debate."
2,"So it is metaphysical independence that creates personhood?  I guess Siamese twins are really one person, not two.Partial-birth abortion is a political  term for Intact dilation and extraction and several variants (    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-birth_abortion    ).If a physician pulling a fetus out of the birth canal does not constitute a birth, then neither of my children were ""born.""  Both need to be pulled in the final minutes of labor.If a physician pulling a fetus out of the birth canal does not constitute a birth, then a physician performing a Cesarean certainly would not constitute a birth.For both of my children, the ""laws of nature DID NOT induce a biological process which expels and organism fully developed to function autonomously"".  Both were induced with medicine, labor did not naturally occur.  Both were born attached to an umbilical cord, they were not autonomous.You are correct, cesarean births do not change the debate, they make it a stronger case that personhood has nothing to do with the birth and must exist before.If ""Exotic, borderline, or abnormal cases do not define the principle or category,"" then why can we not outlaw partial-birth abortions?  Anyone willing to read the description (or watch a video) of the process can only conclude that at minimum 4/5 of a ""birthed"" fetus (generally called a baby) is killed.  Degrees of ""out of the birth canal"" ARE fundamental here since you have centered your entire argument around this word.  I ask you yet again to define when exactly ""birth"" occurs.I have now scoured the site and read each of your comments several times.  Not once do you actually list a reason for your assertion that ""birth"" creates personhood.  The closest thing to a reason you have given is, ""the laws of nature eventually result in a fetus becoming survivable, fully formed, its organs functioning autonomously, and the whole organism becoming metaphysically independent, and at that time, the law of cause-and-effect induces childbirth.""  You must not know that 28% of US births are not induced naturally.You must not know that a baby 24 weeks from conception can live on machines providing the functions of organs for months and within a few years be a normal healthy child.You must not know that birth does not make a human fully independent from its mother, it is still physically attached.You must not know that not all fetuses are survivable when birthed.You must not know that not all fetuses are fully formed when birthed.You must not know that spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) occur on a regular basis.You must not know that a fetus 5 seconds before birth is physically identical in every way to the same organism 5 seconds after birth and that there is no magical physical transformation during the birthing process.Wendy, you are not debating the issue at hand, but simply discounting my statements as meaningless and repeating that you have laid out a solid case for your position which you have not; you have not laid out any case.  Please debate the issue so we can see the truth."
1,"First, a minor correction. I should have stated, ""...the whole organism becoming *capable of being* metaphysically independent.""Metaphysical independence is a requirement for any rational concept of ""personhood,"" yes. Siamese twins ARE metaphysically independent. If you do not know what metaphysical means, and the prefix ""meta"" does not clue you in, that is not my problem. I can tell you it has nothing to do with umbilical cord status.You keep using an invalid approach, intrinsicism, to make your point, claiming that value resides IN this or that part (arms, fingers, heartbeats, DNA, etc.). But value is objective; it is not intrinsic to anything. You do anything and everything but look at what a fetus IS, what IT is, in its totality, its actual nature, as an entity. I cannot force you to think in rational terms, but don't expect me to say that just because you are arguing something, maybe you have a point. You don't.In fact, your argument about medical technology only STRENGTHENS my argument and weakens your own. In a Cesarean section, the doctor has determined in THAT PARTICULAR CASE that the fetus is survivable with a certain level of medical support AT THE POINT when the operation is scheduled. In other words, it is objective: The values of the mother, needs of the offspring, and medical capabilities meet at that point.Now, except in exotic, borderline, and abnormal cases, when is a fetus fully formed, capable of functioning autonomously and being metaphysically independent? At birth. Nature makes it so. The burden of proof would be on you in any particular case to prove otherwise. Can you predict when it will be ""5 seconds before birth"" for a given fetus? No? The rational, objective standard is birth.In a premature birth where the baby is kept alive with medical support, it is only alive because it is receiving medical support, which by definition a pregnant woman seeking an abortion does not want to provide to the fetus. What medical technology can do for a fetus, however, is irrelevant. What is relevant is WHAT A FETUS IS. It is absurd and atrocious to suggest that a woman should have to carry a pregnancy because if she did remove the fetus from her body and did provide medical rescue which she by definition is unwilling to provide, it will be a baby at that point. Potential beings have no rights over actual beings, not in any valid ethical or political system.And to repeat, an abortion is not a birth. In an abortion, a fetus is terminated and removed, or partially removed and terminated. Order does not matter; it is a fetus. There is no intrinsic value to ""out of the birth canal."" It happens during abortions, and it happens during births. So?I do not see how any of the other points in your post, e.g., miscarriages, relate to anything or argue for anything. But since you insist on going all the way through all possible exotic, borderline, and abnormal cases, let's go the other way and discuss how a fertilized egg is a human being entitled to individual rights, if you are as interested in getting to the truth as you claim. Still waiting for that evidence that a fertilized egg has a soul."
1,"As a rule I don't reccommend my own posts, and if there's a single post on this thread that should be this is certainly one such."
2,"Why do you fail to realize that your criteria is just as arbitrary and nonfundamental?  Intact dilation and extraction, to use a term you might find acceptable, and thus worthy of debate, does involve the fetus passing through the birth canal.  If ""a physician pulling a fetus out of the birth canal does not constitute a birth,"" then what does?  Are babies born by induced labor not people, then?  What about those rare times in which the subject survives intact dilation and extraction?  Are they still fetuses, though they are still alive and clearly outside of the womb?  In your previous post, you have once again proclaimed without any justification that these cases will not be considered, but that's not good enough.  This is a debate, and you must give counter-arguments against arguments brought to bear, or admit defeat. "
1,"An aborted fetus is an unformed, unviable, clinically dead entity with a destroyed brain. There is no rational sense in which such a thing is a person. Only irrational emotions could lead one to proclaim it a person."
2,"It is up to the individual who wants to change the status quo to provide a reason.  For example, we have a fetus bumping along on it's way to birth.  You want to justify killing it.  You've got to have reasons.  Furthermore, even if the onus of proof is on us, that doesn't also make you the judge of what is valid evidence or not, no questions asked.  When an argument is brought up, you must argue against it, you cannot simply proclaim that it is not evidence.  I haven't read all of your comments yet, but I'm getting there, and I have not yet seen you give a counter argument.  You just state the same arbitrary proclaimation over and over again.  ""A fetus is not a person, it is a potential person.  Birth makes a human.  Any arguments you bring against this will not be considered.  They will be written off as religiously motivated or invalid because I said so."""
2," Abortions encourage infanticide Ronald Reagan, ""Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation"", Human Life Review, Spring 1984. - ""Late-term abortions, especially when the baby survives, but is then killed by starvation, neglect, or suffocation, show once again the link between abortion and infanticide. The time to stop both is now.""[10]
"
1,"“If men could get pregnant,   abortion   would be a sacrament”"
2,"Let's actually do something about this.  It appears that we can all agree that a fetus (the new, growing organism of a pregnancy beginning at the 3rd month) is a human and thus deserves legal protection.  Let's modify our state and federal laws to declare a fetus a ""full human"" and protect it.  This would make abortion legal only before the 3rd month.Now that we have some sanity, consistency, and are all on the same medical / scientific page, we can begin discussing the humanity of an embryo (the new, growing organism of a pregnancy up to the 3rd month).At this point we have to decide who gets to decide the humanity of an embryo.  Is it each mother's opinion?  It is a medical board's opinion?  Congress?  The Courts?  A nation-wide vote?  Right now, the Supreme Court has essentially answered that: each monther's opinion.  Is that really the right choice?  Each mother gets to decide when her pregnancy changes from a non-human to a human?  This doesn't make sense.  There is no standard, no acceptance of facts, only pure opinion.For now, let's fix the obvious: a fetus is a human and deserves all the rights of a 1 year old, 10 year old, and 100 year old."
1,"To pretend that the poster above you who disagrees with you does not exist, after you have just responded to her, indicates that you have substantially broken with reality. To pretend that everyone is on the ""same page"" as you regarding abortion is proof of it.I will let you guess as to the clinical term for this condition.You object to a pregnant woman's opinion as non-objective, then demand that your own opinion, that a fetus is a human deserving of the rights of a 10-year-old, get treated as an objective fact. Then you wonder which authority's opinion establishes reality. But no one's opinion establishes reality. Reality exists independently of human opinion, and reason is our only tool to understand it.And reason is clear on this issue. There is no humanity of a fetus to discuss because a fetus is not a person. You cannot offer any rational, logical, secular evidence that a fetus is a person, because there is none. There can be no evidence for that which does not exist."
2,"First, my apologies for creating some confusion.My comments were strictly in response the ""argument"" and was written before I read the comments.  I did however read the comments before I posted mine and I did ""ignore"" your comment essentially because you changed the topic.  The argument is about embryos, not fetuses.  Scientifically, there is a vast difference.  After I reread all the comments (including my own) I looked for a way to edit them in order to reference yours, but I could find no edit link.I have no intention of pretending you do not exist; you believe your position as much as I believe mine.  I have every intention of creating a true debate.The argument states that an embryo is not a human (person), but it also implies that a fetus is.Everyone being on the ""same page"" proves nothing beyond agreement of opinion.I think definitions are getting mixed up here.  Life, humanity, person: are these the same thing?  I believe we must consistently define what ""personhood"" is and when it begins.  For the rest of the ""argument,"" let's use one word (human, life, ??? suggestion) as the organism that begins when it can be detected and ends when it is dead (thus fetus through adulthood).  Let's also use one word (personhood, humanity, ??? suggestion) for the status of the organism that is given value and legal protection.It appears that you have essentially said, there is no personhood … because it is not a person,"" which is not a valid statement because a word was used to define itself.  This is also not a reason, it is pure opinion.  It would be valid to say that a fetus is not a person because it does not have the qualities of a person (although I would disagree with that assertion).  Referencing another comment of yours on this argument, it is interesting to say that personhood / legal protection begins at birth.  I'm very curious of your reasons for this.I object to ""each"" woman’s opinion being allowed to define when personhood begins.  Many women would say it begins at conception, many others say at birth.  Men are equally diverse in their opinion.  Some have even said it begins at toddlerhood.  I contend that a set of scientific facts must be allowed to make a consistent decision.  We cannot reasonably have laws that allow for double-murder when a pregnant woman is killed and at the same time declare it legal for a doctor to lethally inject a fetus.  How can both of these laws exist together?You are correct that opinions do not establish reality (fact), but they do establish laws, morals, ethics, values, rules, textbooks, politics, and culture. These things are very powerful, and real forces.  I believe we both agree that reality (fact) must rule the argument / debate / question / decision.  If so then we can and should come to the same conclusion.  I hope to get there."
1,"May I suggest a dictionary definition for personhood?The specific term seems to be lacking in mine, however, the great thing about english is that I can use its root to understand its meaning.Therefore, I submit, the definition of personhood, based on the definition of person, according to the Langenscheidt's New College Merriam-Webster English Dictionary is: Person, n, 1: Human individual.Personhood: the quality of being a human individual."
1,"I have backed up my opinion with objective facts and analysis, not tautologisms. Today I restated why birth is the objective, rational, absolute criteria, so I won't repost it here. But the issue of double-murder for pregnant women is important, so I will address that here.Double-murder laws exist because the law-makers are not being rational. Look, is it somehow fundamentally different that a man fatally stabs a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman? Is he any less of a murderer in the latter case? No. Any individual who initiates physical force against another human being thereby forfeits his rights, and in the case of a murderer, the appropriate sentence is death.Now, space constraints of the prison system may not allow for just sentences to be carried out, but that is an argument for more prison space and/or executions, not making arbitrary laws to make sure that some crimes do receive a just sentence.It should be acknowledged that a woman puts tremendous biological, temporal, and mental resources, and she takes significant health risks, in carrying a pregnancy. She does so because she values the future potential of the fetus. Therefore, a pregnant woman who survives such an attack but loses the fetus loses something over and above what a non-pregnant woman loses, all things being equal. Sentencing guidelines can recognize this fact to harden the sentence. A double-murder charge is not necessitated."
2,"I still don't agree that it should be legal until the third month, because it's still a living thing, the mother is eating, sleeping, LIVING for the baby, until it can do it on it's own.BUT I do agree with you on this ""a fetus is a human and deserves all the rights of a 1 year old, 10 year old, and 100 year old.""i agree, that's true."
1,"But unborn child is not.  Corpse, by definition, refers to something that used to be alive and is no longer.  Child has many definitions, including the vague ""a person not yet of age,"" and the specific ""an unborn or recently born person"" - New College Merriam-Webster English Dictionary.If one removes a patch of skin, an arm, or a heart, we know that it is part of the human it came from even if done without causing pain.  What part of a woman is the baby?  He/she isn't part of their mother.  How is the mother adversely affected by the removal of this 'part'?If independence is the criterion for personhood, then no person fits the bill.  People are inherently interdependent.  Now, twins joined at the hip - are they part of each other, or separate?  Do they only get one vote?  or two?Back to the beginning, I thought a trimester was 3 months, but what is cited here only applies to the 1st 3 weeks, or not at all.  As for the animal compariston (which doesn't apply), what do you mean by primitive?Any evolutionary comparison is irrelevant since fetal development is not an evolutionary process, likewise, the human being is always human, from the beginning, never becoming anything like a frog or a fish (or anything else for that matter).  If you simply mean that the child hasn't fully formed, does that mean that the Elephant Man wasn't really human?  What about my friend Kyle, whose left hand is almost devoid of fingers?  Is he somehow not human?By the way, a child has discernible fingers at 3 weeks pregnancy; that's why most abortion procedures involve the quartering of the child.  Interestingly, quartering, the practice by which a person's limbs are rent or severed in a bloody mess, has long been deemed 'cruel and unusual punisment'.  We don't even do that to our murderers and rapists, and yet we're to do it to our children?"
1,"Throwing a dictionary at the problem won't make it go away. Definitions are put forth by men, and men can err or be irrational."
1,"I don't know where to begin.  You fail to provide any reasonable or valid definition, and then object when an authoritative one is given on the grounds that you don't like it, saying that 'it doesn't make the problem go away,' without specifying what the problem is (reasonably anyway), and then reccommend your own post like it's holy writ.  Wendy, you have failed.  You are wrong.  You have lost.  I declare this because you are unwilling to admit it, but moreso because such is the case.  You've spewed nothing but fancy babble, and often haven't even addressed the issue, preferring to go off on tangents.  You criticize fact as opinion on the basis of your opinion, and rather than support it, you merely reiterate it as though it were axiomatic (few things truly are).I say this not in rebuttal, for you've given me nothing to refute or otherwise debate; I say this that you might improve, recognize these critical flaws, and to offer the chance for either surrender, or serious debate."
2," Abortion is murder just as infanticide is murder It cannot be said that the abortion of a nine-month-old fetus is much different than the killing of a three day old baby. Neither then can much difference be given to aborting a nine-month-old fetus and a month-old fetus. If infanticide is murder, so too must be abortion.  
"
1,"""So can women be also (and usually are)"" pretty much evicts you from the realm of reason. But just for the sake of the readership, and also because I like playing with entrapped rodents between my claws, I will respond.I am not sure what you think you will accomplish by appealing to authority--of dictionaries or anything else. That is, after all, a formal logical error. There is no such thing as cognitive authority. The human mind is independent--metaphysically independent. We are all intellectually sovereign. Any definition, any dictionary, any idea, any doctrine can be challenged and overthrown if it is shown to be incorrect or irrational. Nothing is ""safe"" from the power of human reason. Irrationality can run, but it can't hide.In that spirit, I went over the concept of concepts elsewhere on this forum, as well as definitions, and I backed up what I was saying with logic. You say that they are unreasonable, but you do not say which ones or why. No where have you refuted my explications. That is because you cannot. That is because there is no refutation. If it existed somewhere in the annals of philosophy, someone would have found it and come back to this forum and posted it. It doesn't exist. I know this, because I did not develop all these concepts and ideas myself; I learned them from Ayn Rand, and no one has ever invalidated her epistemology.Therefore, I declare victory. You have failed. You are wrong. You have lost. I declare this not because you are unwilling to admit it (such a declaration would be the act of someone unconcerned with truth, but with plenty of concern for faking reality to achieve psychological submission of other human beings, or ""persons""), but simply because it is true and I have already proven it. You spew nothing but generalities, dodge the issues and definitions while you ask for ever further clarifications, and then pretend that such clarifications are ""tangent"" when you receive them. You have not presented any facts, only arbitrary assertions which you do not bother to support except with lexicographic irrelevancies, and then you proceed as if your method of thinking were axiomatically valid. By the way, I will state my axioms: Existence, identity, consciousness. What are yours?As for your last offer of either surrender or ""serious"" debate, as opposed to what is going on now, I think I have made it clear who has already won, and besides, I only argue on those terms that are based on reason, not on lesser systems of thought, for I do not wish to be brought down to such a level and beaten with experience.By the way, I refer to my posts, not Recommend them. Someone else is doing that, probably because they grasped what I am saying, even though you ostensibly do not. However, for all your disdain that I may have a positive opinion of my own posts (yes, I do), I seem to recall that in the beginning, one of your fellow anti-abortionists Recommended one of my posts and followed it up with a dismissive argument designed to buy my silence upon pain of not being liked, which would go back to what I was saying about some having as their first concern psychologically manipulating other people rather than establishing truth.Pwned."
1,"is to make up definitions as you go along.  Relying on a formal authority is the foundation of logical, even rational argument.You are correct that an authoritative definition may plausibly be incorrect, but you have failed on every count to demonstrate that such is the case.  And I suppose it would be difficult to discern who is running when you are the one running with irrationality.Oh, and I have successfully challenged what you have put forth of said 'epistemology'; the fundamental problem is that any scenario applied to a human fetus can also be applied to a human being; even a lack of reason - for that condemns the mentally retarded, even the lack of a particular ability, for it condemns the handicapped, even the issue of metaphysical independence, for you cannot prove that such is absent from a fetus - nor can you prove that you possess the same without appealing to God: which would shoot yourself in the foot.Therefore your victory is an illusion, a fantasy in your mind, though unfortunately not alone.  You have offered no evidence for your claims.  Philosophical opinions to not constitute proof; but the sciences of embryology and fetology confirm that both are existing organisms with human properties - when the offspring of humans - and therefore human beings, by definition; they also prove that said beings are alive which is important since a corpse cannot be killed.I have repeatedly squared on the issuesI have clearly defined my terms - you just don't like dictionaries because they're unbiased.I've never asked for elaboration beyond the relevant.I've always been as specific as necessary - you on the other hand, have 'spewed generalities' indirectly, at least, by assuming broad, arbitrary conditions such as 'survivability'.My logic is based on true axioms, and therefore is probably tertiarily axiomatic, but that's not even a logical flaw, quite the opposite actually.I have supported my claims - with biology: high school biology, and logic, basic logic.  And none of my claims are arbitrary, though birth is fundamentally arbitrary - you do know what it means to be arbitrary, right?Existence is an axiom (one which I've been using, but you have not accurately done so)Truth and Fact are the fundamental axioms.Identity is not an axiom.  It's a label.Consciousness is not an axiom.  You do know what an axiom is, don't you?Liar.  Almost the entirity of your last post was irrational.Though you've demonstrated yourself a liar, I will nevertheless retract the accusation that you reccommend your own posts.  But that doesn't warrant the ad hominim."
1,"No, relying on reality is the foundation of logical, rational argument. Yawn.I am losing track of all the logical fallacies you are scoring, but add self-contradiction: ""Relying on a formal authority is the foundation of logical, even rational argument,"" followed by ""...authoritative definition may plausibly be incorrect."" No wonder you don't think Identity is an axiom. You just make it too easy for me.Something tells me you wouldn't know epistemology from the residue in a freshly used urinal, but the retarded and ""handicapped"" DO possess a rational faculty, although in varying degrees, and their rights are in fact delimited to the extent of their mental capacity, which is exactly what one would predict if man's rights are logically derived from his nature as the rational animal. Fetuses do not have any such capacity.When I read, ""Consciousness is not an axiom. You do KNOW what an axiom is, don't YOU?"" [emphasis mine], I almost fell on the floor with laughter. That target is so easy to hit, I won't bother shooting at it. That was even funnier to me than your bit about high school biology supporting your case.You are obviously completely philosophically uninitiated, so I could have a lot of fun here. Let's try this one. You admit that Existence is ""an"" axiom, Identity is not, but that Truth and Fact are the ""fundamental"" axioms. If Existence is not fundamental, and existents don't possess Identity, then what exactly is true or factual? The description of things which are not what they are, which you do not even know exist until you they have been proven factual and true? LOL"
1,"if reality is the foundation of logic, how can logic be used to discover reality?  or are you omniscient?Please note, I did not contradict myself, which you would realize if you'd read what I said; there was afterall a criterion and formula for such occaision.Identities aren't axiomatic; that's why your geometry teacher makes you do proofs.Since you asked the guy with the dictionary; epistemology: the study or a theory of the nature and grounds of knowledge especially with reference to its limits and valididy.  It means nothing [almost] in this debate; for if knowledge is the criterion for human identification, then the comatose cease to be human, while the nature of a human fetus is still dubious; and any trainable animal achieves legal equality with man.Obviously you don't know what an axiom is, therefore; an axiom is that which is self-evident, simply put; authoritatively defined as ""an established rule or principle of self-evident truth.  By the way, since it's in high school biology where one definitely learns about the basic properties of the genome, the process of reproduction, and the fundamental unit of life; I am correct in asserting that any attentive high-schooler knows that human life begins at conception.I never said that existents don't possess identity (maybe I should stick words in your mouth?); I simply said that they don't identify themselves; hence the need for proofs.  Now to answer your question, even as you put it; Truth and Fact themselves.Remember, even for the absurdly doubting Descartes, existence wasn't axiomatic; he had to prove it, but Truth and Fact must exist for the contrary is illogical, absurd, and impossible.  It would appear that you aren't as philosophically inclined as you would have me believe.  Now I tire of this."
1,"I appreciate your feedback and do apologize that this thread hasn't yet satisfied your question.  Therefore, I shall here try to simplify the ojective argument.  The cell is the basic/fundamental unit of life.  Human DNA is unique to human beings.  An organism whose somatic (non-reproductive) cells contain the full human genome is therefore a human being.  A person is defined as a human being, therefore any human being is a person.  A person may be alive or dead as a human being may be alive or dead.  This seems to be important as many wish to interperet the law only for ""persons"".  A living person thus is entitled to those fundamental rights belonging to any other living person, in this case, life.  Since life begins at conception, and the cell at conception of human offspring contains the entire human genome, and makes up the entirety of an organism (as opposed to a sperm cell - incomplete DNA - or a hair - incomplete/non-living organism), it constitutes a human being, and therefore, by definition, a person, who therefore, from conception, as per the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America (this site seems to be restrictive to U.S. policy), is entitled to 'certain unalienable rights among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (in that order).'I sincerely hope this satisfies; it's refreshing to see someone who seems truly open-minded about the matter."
2,"I very much agree that the issue is the status of 'Embryo'.  But your argument cannot answer this.  The fact we know that life is conceived - or you would say potential to life - at conception.  That is established. But your suggestion that sometime on the 90th day the embryo becomes human has now basis.  This is the basic faulty premise with the argument that abortion is not killing.  You arbitrarily asign actuality.  Perhaps it should be the 87th day but then why not the 93rd.  No, logic demands that we accept that life was created at conception.  This we know and must deal with.  Assigning actuality at some later date only serves the singular interest of the mother - who may have suffered abuse accepted - disregarding the rights of the unborn."
1,"Does intellectual dishonesty come naturally to you religionists or do you have to work hard at it? He did not say an embryo was a human being at 90 days. He said that it is not. He said that it is critical to establish its status in the first trimester, because some of your fellow religious kooks apparently think that a fertilized egg has a soul."
2,"Wendy, I'm really surprised by your labeling and accusation of dishonesty.  You assign moral guilt to what was in fact a misunderstanding on my part. And the label 'religious kooks' completely undermines any dialogue.  Mutual respect and civility is a prerequiste in any discussion.  Please don't write back.  I could have heard you before but it would be very difficult now.   "
1,"In medical terms, an ""  abortion  "" happens every time the products of conception (a fertilized egg) leaves the uterus without producing a live birth.  But this happens countless times in nature, as fertilized eggs are routinely washed from the woman's uterus before they can be implanted there.  Abortion opponents might as well consider Mother Nature the world's largest abortion mill. "
2,"I don't want to get emotional on this issue when arguing with pragmatists or just plain idiots, so to spare myself the grief over the lost lives, I will make one LOGICAL argument and leave the rest alone.Forget about religion or morals... let's look from a common sense perspective and leave everything else alone... including that embryo.  Using that logic, if the embryo was left alone what would it become?When two humans mate and a female's egg is fertilized what will be the result of that fertilization.  All physical and or mental abnormalities aside, those two cells dividing will NEVER become anything other than a HUMAN child.  They will never become a rat or a dog, or even a primate which any scientist will tell you we share 98% of our DNA with.  With that in mind, how can make arguments that it is not a person?  Will it, if left alone, become a person?  The answer is yes and there is no refuting that.  Should we not, then, bestow on that future person the same rights we would any other human in this world?  I think we should.  Think on that awhile.Winston Churchill once said: ""All great things are simple, and many can be expressed in single words: freedom, justice, honor, duty, mercy, hope.""Err on the side of justice, honor and mercy, not on the side of political correctness."
2,"Killing helpless fetus is incomparable to death of willing soldier. How can you compare an unborn baby to the willing beings that fight in wars they have choosen the fate of going to war and the know of the harsh consquenses that may follow. A baby on the other hand is born into the world if permitted not of their own free will but of the mother's decision to abort or have the child. 
"
1,"An embryo requires a host to survive. So if left ALONE, without a host, the embryo would die and become nothing, not a person."
1,"I don't don't believe that   abortion   should be used as a form of birth control. I think that there should be a legitimate reason such as, family rape, rape, medical vulnerability, but a person who is willing and get's pregnant should not have the choice if the baby will be healthy and the mother will survive. I think abortion should be legal but with more restrictions. "
1,"Abortion needs to be looked at just like any other killing.  But this argument doesn't suit the title, and is otherwise, for the most part, quite ridiculous."
2,"A woman having to raise a child that she doesn't want is a ""death sentence,"" huh? How ironic that you would choose such language when you are advocating the quite literal death sentence of the child."
1,"Don't want an abortion? Fine. Don't have one. However, don't use government power to force everyone else to live by your biblical edicts. That is immoral. America isn't a democracy. It is a constitutionally- limited republic. That means the limits are on the government, not the people.Today's conservatives hate America and America's founders, because they're incapable of living in a ""free"" society where everyone is capable of making choices for themselves. Pro-life means pro Human life. Those that are already living. Not an embryo nor protoplasm."
1,"So is a human in development, also known as an embryo or fetus, among other names depending upon point of development, not human?  But they are.  No real scientist or doctor would deny that.  Well, are they not beings?  Do they not exist?  Are they not real?  Are they not present?  Then how can you physically remove the imaginary?Now, to the middle part; the issue is about the rights of two human beings: a mother and a child.  That's not even debatable since any doctor worth their degree must admit that the child is a living human being from the beginning.  It's high school biology.To the beginning, giving birth is not a sentence.  It is a consequence, but a deserved one (as all true consequences are).  And of course, being pro-life refers to the actual, real quality of life; not the whimsical, transitory one as in: 'get a life'; though we are pro-that as well.Now, where the birth of a child actually threatens the actual life of the mother, almost no one believes abortion shouldn't be considered.  But it still must be treated as any other killing.Interestingly, in the Declaration of Independence, the three mentioned inalienable rights are listed in a peculiar order: almost as if there's a priority.  [understated]  For if one's happiness takes precedence over your property, right to speak freely, or even life, I can see why there might me a little mix up at the courthouse."
2,"I don't think asking someone to assume responsibility for her actions is too much to ask.  In the end, it only takes nine months to carry a child and give it up for adoption.  You are saying it is OK to kill the child so that the mothers ""life"" isn't thrown away?  Please -- Nine months of putting a kink in a social life is hardly comparable to being put to death by dismemberment.  Abortion is being used by people as a way not to pay the piper.  If you don't want children now, don't make them!"
1,"There are three choices: birth control,   babies  , or   abortion  . For the   pro-life   side the first choice is babies. For the   pro-choice   side the first choice is birth control. Nobodies first choice is abortion."
1,"""This is a scientific fact, not a religious claim."" No, it is not a scientific fact. Yes, it is a religious claim. A fetus may be alive, but it is not a human being. It is an incompletely formed, incompletely developed entity, and that is why it remains in the mother's body. That is a FACT, and anyone who claims otherwise is ""making a political statement, not a scientific one.""It is with amusement that I watch the anti-abortionists simply try to pretend that this issue is now a matter of ""science,"" which they imply means only finding concrete parallels and precludes interpretation and analysis.Watch this: Birds possess a heartbeat. Human cancer cells have human DNA. Even rodents have ""brainwaves."" Those are ""scientific"" facts. Does that make birds, cancer, and rodents human? No? What is the difference? How do you ""know"" a fertilized egg has a soul? What ""scientific"" fact led you to conclude that?"
1,"Seriously, since you at the FRC have decided to play scientist now, we all want to know what scientific fact led you to conclude that a fertilized egg has a soul.Your tactic didn't work that well when you tried to push Intelligent Design on us, either."
1,"""Back alley"" abortions are more frequent when abortion is illegal. Back-alley abortions are abortions performed illegally on the ""black-market"" when abortion is generally illegal. Back-alley abortions are less regulated and more likely to result in the death or harming of the mother.
"
2,"A soul is a religious concept, not a scientific one.  Science cannot discover or identify a soul."
1,"so what is the basis of FRC's claim? Are you claiming that 4 cells, the size of a period at the end of this sentence, is the same thing as a living breathing child and should have all the rights of a living breathing child? "
2,"that's somewhat true BUT you can use an ultrasound and SEE the fetus, a living thing!!!"
2,"How is it a religious fact?? It's scientific!! what does religion have to do with it? it's a living CHILD, that's going to be brought into the WORLD! GOD made the child and it's a LIVING THING. right after conceiving the baby, IT'S ALIVE. and you want it legal to kill a living thing? a living human?? that's murder. it's an innocent child."
1,"You're defining ""living, human being"" as ""cell with it's own unique genetic code."" Right?"
1,"Why wait for the Supreme Court to rule again.  Many/most abortions are chosen because of financial reasons.  So, all ye who are against   abortion  , sell your home, move into a little trailer with a couple of roommates to save   money  . Then drive over to an abortion provider and offer to PAY women to not have abortions.  $500 a month would make many NOT have an abortion.  Put all your money in a trust for the mom and baby. $500 a month for 18 years will probably make fewer abortions.  ""But wait,"" you say, ""she might not spend the money on the child?"" I'm ok with someone choosing an abortion.  You won't trust her with your money but you want me to trust her with a baby?  That doesn't make sense.  Oh, you can offer to open up your home to a woman who needs a place to live. Many women live in difficult,  potentially dangerous situations.  Some do not want to bring another human into that situation, so if she knew she could live someplace better, she might not choose to have an abortion.  ""But wait,"" you say. ""She might be crazy, or steal from you, or bring home a series of dangerous boyfriends.""  At least you can run out of your house or dial 911. Remember, that infant cannot call for help, not for years and years.The anti-abortion folks believe the right to life begins at conception and ends at birth. "
1,It is true that there are risks associated with abortion but there are also risks associated with childbirth. In 2002 alone there were 357 maternal deaths in the USA (    http://mchb.hrsa.gov/mchirc   / chusa_04/pages/0409mm.htm).I would be interested to see what percentage of legal abortions ended in death as this would be a far more instructive indication of its risks.Childbirth has numerous health risks (many of which are similar/the same as the ones you describe for abortion) -     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth    #Complications_and_risks_of_birthThere are also psychological risks associated with childbirth. Post Natal Depression may affect 1 in 10 women (    http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinformation/mentalhealthproblems/postnatalmentalhealth/postnataldepression.aspx    ) and can be a severely debilitating illness. 
1,"The only women who suffer psychologically are the ones who buy into the evangelicals' irrational anti-abortion propaganda. Women who do not are fine.However, the issue is not whether women suffer. The issue is whether women should have a right to abort a fetus or not. The answer is that they should and do have that right, because in all reason, a fetus does not have rights."
1,"I think everything you've attributed to a safe, legal abortion can be said for any woman who's delivered a child.  Thousands of women die around the world because they don't have access to birth control, or medical care during pregnancy nor a place to go to have babies delivered.  Beating women into submission about abortion is cruel and uncaring.  I'd like to see the enforced pregnancy crowd do more to make sure all children are wanted, have medical care, food, shelter, and parents who can parent.  You want to stop women, millions who are completely unknown to you, from seeking solutions to their private problems.  Yet, when that child is born you turn your backs.  You tell women that it's their fault that they got pregnant. How many times I've seen remarks like ""close your legs next time"" or ""your mistake isn't my responsibility"" on message boards.  We have over 9 million children in the United States who have no medical coverage.  Where is the pro-pregnancy crowd on that issue?  Siding with George Bush that they should have any because we don't want to cut into the insurance companies profit margins or raise taxes to help pay for it.  Why is an embryo sacred and a child no more than someone else's mistake?We have approximately 1.2 million abortions performed in the U.S. every year.  Are you going to find one million couples who are willing to adopt a child, every year?  Over turning Roe would only increase problems but then you folks are all for that. Let others get the burden of trying to solve them.  As far as you're concerned you did your job. We have nearly 500,000 children living in foster care.  Half of those are available for adoption.  Many will live in the system because they have past issues, siblings, are the wrong color for some folks, or have medical problems.  Once they turn 18 they are out of the system except those with medical disabilities.  They have no family to help them.  Where are you people in regards to them?  Why are there so many of these children living in these situations?  Why aren't you making a real effort to get these kids out of foster care and into a good home?  Roe was based on privacy so tell me, how is woman having an abortion any of your business?  Unless it's your wife, daughter, or another relative I really can't see why you have any right to interfere.  Make the world a welcome place for a child.  Help pass laws that provide a living wage to working women and health care for them.  Make sure they have good food to eat every day and a safe place to live.  Provide help to parents when they are under going the stresses of parenting.  Let no child have to live in a homeless shelter.  When we can solve these major problems then let's sit down and have a chat about the morality of poking your nose into other people's privacy.Oh, and by the way, I've had two safe legal abortions in my life.  No, I don't feel guilty and no, I don't regret my decision.  My spiritual beliefs say embryos aren't fully human and until they take that first breathe they are not of this world.  So you see, I'm not buying into your guilt trip.  Your concept of God seems to make that deity pretty weak and incompetent as far as I'm concerned.  How you choose to worship your god is your business but you have no right to force me to live according to those beliefs.  A woman's abortion has no financial or physical impact on your life so leave them alone and leave them in peace.  We can't even take care of the children who are here now and you want to bring more of them into this mess."
1,"I could not have said it better.......Nonsense made perfect sense to me and my views...I also had 1 abortion after my husband had a vasectomy and I already had 6 children..I never ever regreted my choice nor did he......It is between me,doctor,husband and god......Not the United States government!!"
1,"Legal abortions are much safer than black-market abortions. Mary Calderone, founder of SIECUS and medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, ""Illegal abortion as a public health problem,"" American Journal of Public Health, July 1960 - ""90% of illegal abortions are being done by physicians. Call them what you will, abortionists or anything else, they are still physicians, trained as such; . . . They must do a pretty good job if the death rate is as low as it is . . . Abortion, whether therapeutic or illegal, is in the main no longer dangerous, because it is being done well by physicians.""[11]
"
2,"so what if your husband had a vasectomy?? you already had 6 children, you know the joy they bring!! and if you didn't want the baby, you could have given it up for adoption, give it to a family that wanted the baby, instead of killing it! if you didn't want another kid, you should have used a CONDOM or BIRTH CONTROL OF SOME SORT BEFORE YOU HAD SEX!!!!"
1,"She said her husband had a vasectomy. The failure rate is only about .01%-1%. THIS IS BIRTH CONTROL!!!!! Are you brain dead? Yes, I am sure having six   children   shows you the joys of having a child, but it also shows you the trials, tribulations, etc. of child rearing as well. What about the strain on a family of eight bringing another child in the world? Frankly, is it even any of your business? And by the way, to condemn someone who, even by anti-choicer's standards ""played"" by the rules and did use birth control is pretty weak. So now her and her husband have to throw on three condoms cover themselves in spermicidal, use a diaphram, and be on the pill, as well as taking Plan B after the fact? Is that enough for you? No, because if even after all this, she was unfortunate enough to get pregnant, you would condemn her anyway for not being ""careful"" or ""responsible"" enough. Do you have any adopted children? I am tired of your crowd spouting out hate and then passing the buck to some random family that wants a baby through the   adoption   system. Put your   money   where your mouth is. Keep your legs crossed horribledisaster. "
1,"This basically boils down to ""we feel it is not safe for you to make your choices, so we're making them for you,"" and once again takes away all choice. It's already been pointed out that actual childbirth is harder on a woman's body than on an abortion; it's also true that many women who have abortions have no impact on their well-being (or it's improved, if they had a fetus implant in the fallopian tubes.) The FRC does not have the authority to make choices for individual women's well-being. "
1,"People suffer physically and psychologically after giving birth. Heck, people suffer physically and psychologically after open-heart surgery. Thusly, birth and other difficult and dangerous operations should be made illegal."
1,"Women who are opposed to   abortion   shouldn't have abortions.  They are the ones who end up regretting their decisions. They're easy to spot.  They're typically the ones who come in to the clinic proclaiming ""I think abortion is wrong, but in my case it's necessary"".Abortion is a personal and private matter.  Period."
1,"Even if we accepted your ridiculous argument in all its vagaries that abortion has a negative impact on communities and society at large, it would be completely irrelevant. The issue is not communities or societies. The issue is individual rights. There is no such thing as a moral decision to override the rights of the individual. Overriding the rights of the individual is the negation of morality.By the way, nothing good has ever come from communities overriding individual rights. Study world history."
1,"I say government and church's have no right to interfere in a woman's choice about her own body..Only she knows what is best for her and her situation and being forced to give birth to a child changes a mothers life forever, rather it be a choice to keep the child or give that child up for adoption.and most unwanted pregnancies are the burden of poor women who don't either can't care for them properly or she was a victim of rape or incest and no way should she be forced to have that child.....A person I feel has a better chance to get over an abortion then to have a child they give up and wonder the rest of their life where and how that child is......I say as long as it is very early in the pregnancy, abortion should be an option available to all women and decided between her, her doctor and if involved the father of that fetus....that is my stand..... "
1,"Perhaps you haven't heard, there was a detailed study of what factors most influence murder rates, guess what, access to   abortion   was number ONE.  The problem is that having babies stresses families who already have limited resources.  Further, it doesn't make sense to expect young men and women to be perfect reproductive human beings, then when  they make a mistake to  require them  to have a child.   (We  are programmed to reproduced; that's  how our specie survived.)  And, by the way, you only get 2 years of welfare because we don't want to pay for your mistake.Didn't Jesus say something about forgiving sins?"
1,"If anyone really believed that abortion is murder, he or she would be advocating the same penalty for women who choose to have abortions as the law prescribes for anyone else who is guilty of premeditated murder: twenty-five years to life, ususally.  I have never heard anyone call for that, or any punishment whatsoever for women who abort.  Therefore, it is logically inescapable that no one really believes a fetus is the same as a child, no matter what they claim to believe."
2,"According to your reasoning:If anyone really belived death penalty is murder, he or she would be advocating the same penalty for those who carry out/sentence the death penalty as the law prescribes for premeditated murder.I honestly don't believe that those opposed to the death penalty want jury members, judges, and law officials to be jailed over it. They simply want the option off the table.  The same is true with the abortion issue.  Your argument once again tries to make abortion solely a women's rights issue when those who oppose it are heart-broken over the loss of innocent life.  I will never accept the pro-choice point of view, but I can oppose it without labeling pro-choicers as murderers.  "

1,"is not the same as the right to life, as I have argued elsewhere on this thread. One does not treat an acorn as one treats an oak tree. One does not treat a four-year-old as one does a teenager.  Development does count.Yes, our lives begin at conception, but what we do with them comes after entering the world and it is that ""doing"" that counts for the moral judgement of 'innocent.'  A fetus is no more innocent than it is guilty. The ""doing"" is also largely what we are beyond a collection of dna. God may judge people on the basis of nothing more than their DNA(though the Bible would seem to be evidence to the contrary) but to say that ""doing""  counts for nothing then perhaps we should revise our moral judgement of men like Hitler, etc.The truth is we are not passing judgement on the fetus, we are not considering their innocence or guilt, we are making a judgement about the place in our lives of an as-yet unborn fetus (I mean the first-trimester).  We are examining our abilitities, our life's goals, our financial prospects and current state, perhaps even whether this is a world ready for yet another mouth to feed --in short we are examining the wisdom of having and raising a child, not only by ourselves but others (I gave my daughter up for adoption when it was the only alternative to raising her myself, whch I could not realistically expect to do. I can't tell you how much I regret the abuse she recieved at their hands).Only someone that believes that what we Do counts for nothing could believe that the choice of a woman excercising her judgment counts for nothng against the dictates of you and your God."

1,"According to the logic behind this argument as to why a woman should have no legal control over her body parts, you and I have committed murder, or man-slaughter.There are thousands of innocent children who are dying everyday through lack of such a simple thing as a functioning kidney, or bone marrow.  When you choose to retain your body parts, or choose to not undergo a painful process you are killing those children through your inaction.  If you know that a child will die and you do nothing to prevent it, you have murdered that child.  According to the logic that a woman must give up control of her body parts for the sake of saving a life, all people must do so.  If   abortion   should be illegal, so also should non-compliance with other medical procedures that can save lives.  "
1,"Why should it be illegal? Would you take away the choice for a 13 or 14 year old girl who was raped? Yes, there is giving it up for   adoption  , but it is the fact that a child will have to carry a child. I do think that it shouldn't even be an option for older women, because it is, usually, their own fault they're pregnant in the first place. Also, what do you think when you see a pregnant 20 year old versus a pregnant 14 year old? It won't hurt anyone older to carry their child. The only acceptable times for an   abortion   are rape and if carrying the child could kill or harm you severely. "
1,"The points you make here seem to be as follows:- Regulations on abortion clinics are sometimes inadequate or ill-enforced.- Some women experience complications.- Some women have regrets after having abortions.These are real issues, but they shouldn't be dealt with by banning abortion. We should make sure abortion clinics can't weasel out of important safety regulations, that's clearly true. Every medical and surgical procedure has complications, so patients need to be adequately informed of possible risks -- this is true even of things like wisdom teeth extraction or appendectomies, but surely you wouldn't advocate banning those. Finally, some people wish they hadn't done it? That has never, in the history of our country, been an adequate reason for banning something. You might as well ban ugly ties and disco music."

He just took it over.  In the end, he said: ""Europe will stand up and thank me, for eliminating the defective from the gene pool"".  Like almost everybody in the world, Hitler believed in Darwin's ideas of some peoples being inferior to other.  Hitler really meant what he said; and, explicitly.Anyway, don't shrink from the moral complexity, Cameron.

1,I don't have a right to engage in sexual intercourse and then later insist that my rights were violated because the woman used protection. It's not a violation of my rights for a woman to refuse to have sex with me unless there's birth control involved. We do not have a right to procreate.
2,"I believe that you may be correct in the case of a few dictators in human history; but, it would have to be a pretty overwhelming and controlling government which would take away its slaves' opportunity to procreate by   law  ."
1,"Here's a great example of the difference between a positive and a negative right.Stating this right in a positive way would be saying:I have the right to procreate.or more specificallyI have a right, as a male, to decide what happens to any individual created using my sperm.Which is a weird right, but okay. Let's go with that.Firstly, is it a codified right? I can't think of anywhere that such a right is stated or implied, unless you count your genetic offspring as property.Is it a natural right? Unlikely--people who give up their   children   for   adoption   and later want access to them, and have that refused, don't have their rights violated. Sperm or egg donors do not have their rights violated if they don't get to name\provide\have a say in their offspring's life.So let's look at the negative right statement, ie.No one should have the right to impede my procreationOR MORE SPECIFICALLYNo one should have the right to disallow my choosing to decide what happens yadda yadda yaddaThis right could be applied to the government, or to the general populace.Now, I agree that the government cannot and should not mandate abortions, forced sterilizations, etc, like many governments have done (including the US). However, that's not what's happening. The government simply makes the option available, like any other medical procedure. It provides them some funding, since it's difficult to train   doctors   in such a procedure unless you're dedicated to it, and operating an   abortion   clinic as opposed to a plastic surgery clinic is about six times as expensive, to protect it from   terrorism   by extremists.So at last we have the ""No one should have the right to disallow...""This is almost an eerie return to biblical morality. Not the good kind, where there's love and feeding of the poor--the scary kind. Rapists are forced to marry their victims kind. Does a rapist have the right to impede the abortion of the woman he's raped? Does a man or a woman have the right to force his involvement on his child, if a court order prevented it?"
2,"As in the past, you present a thoughtful question.  I will think more about this.For now, I will just ask ""What is Natural Law?"" and have we rights, after all, which are ""given us by our Creator, such as Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness?""Does that still have meaning, today?  And, if not, then are we ""in the soup"" or not?"

2,"Yes.  Now.  Because   abortion   is now considered a ""right"", it is beyond the court of the land to enforce it.But don't you argue that the court (the State) can violate Natural Law?  Shouldn't the court violate the right to elective abortion?I more than that look upon the ""little one's"" right to life.

1,"You have to look at the concept of natural   law  , and what would allow those rights to be violated. Do the laws of the state have the right to violate those natural rights?I'd argue that yes, they do.There may be natural law, but there isn't a natural law that states, for example, that, oh, you can't smoke   marijuana  . I think you'd be hardpressed to find someone who believes that is a natural law. However, the state can imprison you for doing so, thusly infringing on your Natural Right to liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.There's no Natural Law that says you have to be loyal to your country, but the State has the right to kill you if you commit treason, violating your Natural Right to life."
2,"He should not have reversed something that was voted, and reflected the will of the majority. THAT should never be allowed in a true democracy. We are moving away from being one every day."
2," Abortions are very risky and hazardous to the women Warren Hern, abortion practitioner and author of Abortion Practice (1990), the textbook most widely used in the United States to teach abortion to medical personnel - ""In medical practice, there are few surgical procedures given so little attention and so underrated in its potential hazard as abortion.""

1,Here is a link to a site with all the major polls from news agencies and polling entities.  http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm  You find that the majority of people do not share your views. 
2,"Fox news polls usually come out leaning conservative, MSNBC polls come out leaning liberal - surprise, surprise...not!"
1,"In most of the polls pro life and pro choice are statistically equal.  I saw no big surprises from any of the polls in the way you put it, except for the fact that even most of the people FOX polled still came out in favor for abortions in various situations with the exception of using it for unwanted pregnancies. None of the so called ""liberal"" news organizations established anything near a majority for pro choice.However, given that the majority of people do allow for a range of exceptions where   abortion   is permitted, Obama's repealing of the MCP brings how the federal government gives financial aid around the world more in line with the view of our citizens. The MCP established a false majority, in favor of the pro life ideas, this clearly not the case in the polls nor by the votes. Don't forget the couple of states who put legislation, trying to either restrict abortion or to do away with it entirely, to the vote in the last presidential election were defeated.Repealing the MCP just puts thing back to the equal footing between the opposing sides that existed before default status was wrongly given to the pro life side."
1,I think it should be a choice for the person facing the question and noone esle business.I personally don't approve but that don't mean jane doe shouldn't get one if  you don't approve don't get one!!!where do  you stand on my opinion???
1,"I share your views, I also think it is one of those questions that only the person involved can make based on a personal level. This is why I always defend choice."
1,Sounds like a fair man|women there that is one thing that makes this country great because we can make choice's  and I am glad to hear someone agree with me I tip my hat to ya....thank ya
1,"The gag rule was put in place by Reagan, kept by Bush Sr., reversed by Clinton, put back by Bush Jr., and reversed again by Obama. It just alternates as the Republicans and Democrats exchange control of government. If you think the will of the people is important to listen to, you should agree with the reversal -- the people elected a Democrat, and reversing the global gag rule comes along with that."
1,"What are you talking about moving away from a true   democracy  ,in a democracy you are alloud to make chooses for yourself in this case someone esle is making it for you. I Personally do not approve of   abortion   that don't mean I can decide for someone esle and niether should you or anyone esle!!! It's should be the single person choice!!!"
2,"I just made a long call to the Family Research Council in Washington DC, I was interested in possibly supporting them, I agree on many of the positions they claim to represent.  I am setting here very disappointed, to use mild comparisons they appear to be modern day Pharisees and Sadducees.  For you non   Christians   they may be people who have hidden motives and are not who they claim to be.  It is impossible to determine who or where there funding comes from.  For all we know they could be funded by interests in China who wish to have much more control over the USA.  The Fact is we just don’t know who the   money   comes from or if they have hidden motives.  Do any of you know exactly who there money comes from?  Please don’t use the Evangelical Council as a resource to find more on this subject, you will get only general meaningless data from them.  How about it Family Research Council, give us a list of your top twenty contributors and there amounts."
2,"Odd, that in our bad economy that we can't find money for alot of things but we can find money to kill children. That money has been stored since Bush did the right thing 8 years ago. That money should have gone to things like homlessness or how about the foster care system. "
2,"Preventing ""back alley"" abortions are no reason to legalize abortion. That the illegality of abortion may lead to back-alley abortions is not a reason to legalize abortion. This argument has nothing to do with the core moral principles underlying the debate (regarding life and rights), so should not be considered. 
"
1,"Actually, reversing the ban doesn't change how much money the program takes up. It just makes more groups and places eligible for funding. Those places aren't performing abortions 24/7, you know. One might say it's pretty inhumane to deny funding to a medical organization because, in addition to providing malaria nets and polio vaccines and clean drinking water, they are also willing to perform abortions. Funding should go to the groups best equipped to spend it most efficaciously, regardless of whether they sycophantically agree with the entire conservative Christian agenda."
2,The thing has been growning by 40 mill every year since it has been gagged. I am saying the money shold have been used some place else. You don't have to agree with the Conservative Christian ideaolgy to agree abortions are wrong. 
1,IT should be a choice of the person facing that question not your I don't approve of   abortion   that don't mean it should be that way we live in a country of free choices if you don't believe don't go get one!!!!
1,"If the collective wishes to maintain the position that an unborn fetus is indeed an independent or separate life from the mother with necessary rights and liberties of its own, I would suggest the collective express their deeply-felt convictions by allowing the mother to exercise her right to distance herself from that independent or separate life - regardless of its stage of development - to allow it the opportunity to survive on its own as one would do for any genuinely independent ""person"". If the collective wishes to impose its will that this independent and separate life survive despite the mother's personal choices - i.e., her values, it falls to the collective to take responsibility for that life to remain consistent in its collective beliefs.In the belief the fetus has rights and ought to have liberties, you cannot ignore the fact the mother has rights and liberties too. To deny the rights and liberties of the mother is to, in effect, contradict your belief a fetus has the same because it falls into the collective definition of ""person"". In light of the ""collective will"" in situations where a pregnant woman wishes to end her pregnancy, the only possible fairness to mother and fetus is to allow the fetus and the mother to go their separate ways allowing each to survive as best each is able on their own. The collective - no matter how large - cannot have the right to hold the mother hostage to the survival of the fetus by compelling her to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, particularly if the argument is said fetus is a human being technically equal to the mother. The rights of one human being do not include the right to deny the rights of another. In that case, if one insists the fetus is a ""person"", neither said fetus nor those who wish to stand in unity with said fetus can insist the mother remain as incubator.If a ""fetus"" is, in fact, a person, let that fetus fend for itself. It has no claim to the body of the mother - if you wish to maintain the mother has no claim on the fetus. If, instead, you change your position to claim a mother has legitimate claim on the fetus within her womb, that changes everything. In such case, the mother has the right to abort at a time and place of her choosing.The collective - no matter how large in number - has no legitimate claim to the body of an individual woman or to the bodies of all women. Neither individual nor collective rights extend far. They cannot because the source of individual rights are an individual life. The source of collective rights are the individual rights of its members and ONLY of its specific members. Those collective rights cannot extend to the lives of non-members of the collective, said collective in this case being those who oppose   abortion   or a ""majority"" that supports imposing its will onto a potential mother's body."
2,"In theory it sounds right that the mother also has rights and that the collective should care for the fetus, if they feel it has a right to live. However, what about personal responsibility? The personal responsibility of the mother to prevent life from forming if she did not want it? It's a bit late to talk about her rights over that fetus' rights that late in the game. If she used contraception and it was truly a mistake, I still say she has the ultimate personal responsibility. If she wanted to be sure not to conceive, use 2 forms of contraception, abstain...whatever it takes. Why should I, as part of the collective, be responsible for her whims? Or her lack of personal responsibility. That is the main theme here that is missing from our society...personal responsibility!So a mother can be irresponsible, even to the point of expecting everyone else take care of the child she doesn't want?"
1,You are confusing the two things. It may be that the woman by making the personal choice whether to have a baby or not is making the most responsible decision. The problem for the pro life side is that they want to enforce their personal opinions on others and then make them responsible for this view that may not be the way the woman feels. If there is something missing in our society today it is that not enough people are minding their own business. 
2,"That funding should have gone to educating women and men not to create life in the first place. Seriously it isn't that hard not to spread your legs. A condom takes 5 seconds to put on, birth control isn't that hard to get, spermicide costs less than having an   abortion  . There are so many preventative measures out there. That if the person gets pregnant regardless of the options available to them, then they should be forced to live the consequence there actions have brought. My   money   should not be used to fund 'fixing' someone else's mistake, and irresponsibility. "
1,But you are still paying for what you consider someone else's mistake and irresponsibility when they have a child that they couldn't afford to care for independently. 
2,"It's much cheaper for the state to pay for a woman to abort a child she cannot afford than for the state to pay for that child through its entire life. Forcing women to carry   children   to term, especially when they don't have the means or desire to raise the child is good for no one, not least the child.   Children born to mothers without the means to take care of them are more likely to be abused, uneducated, unhealthy, do drugs, commit crimes, etc.  In the book Freaknomics, the authors discuss the fact that   crime   rates inexplicably plummeted about two decades after Roe vs. Wade; they argue that this is because many poor women chose to abort their children rather than have them, resulting in fewer criminals 20 years on.  "
1,If you look at the websites of organisations opposed to   abortion   you find that many of them also oppose contraception. Contraception was banned in the Republic of Ireland from 1921 to 1992. The Irish government did what the Catholic Church told them.Do not assume that   condoms   and spermicide are allways available in every country.
1," If a fetus had a right to life, abortionists would be subject to murder charges While abortionists claim that fetuses should have a right to life, they would never go so far as to charge abortionists with murder. Yet, this is what would be required if we gave fetuses a right to life. Therefore, there is a fundamental inconsistency in this position.
"
2,"Abortions are emotionally and psychologically unsafe. If by 'safe' you mean that a woman can survive, then the answer is possibly. A woman can have even multiple abortions and live through each.  But if by 'safe' you mean that she will experience no physical, emotional, or psychological harm, then the answer is no.  She will spend the rest of her life dealing with the myriad of consequences of the abortion by constantly shoving the rattling skeletons back into the closet. And will daily seek expiation, or seek to justify herself. In any case, none of these leaves a woman 'safe'. 
"
2,"A baby is not a accident or a consequence. There you were bad and the baby is your punishment? What kind of   pro-life   attitude is that? A baby may be a surprise but it should never be thought of as a mistake. Oh, and the Bush policy that Obama changed didn't support birth control either. "
1,"I have always been   pro-choice   and strongly believe that the decision to have an   abortion   is a strict matter between the woman and her husband or physcian. If she is single then someone she respects is fine as well.  Ultimately, its the woman, not the government, that should make the decision.  Barry Goldwater, a strong conservative, was strongly pro-choice because he thought like me, that what goes on in the bedroom, stays in the bedroom!  Today, if he tried to run as a Republican, he would be trounced in the GOP primary!  Abortion services, especially in the 3rd world, was until Bush became President, was one of many services that was sponsored by our government. Its always been interesting to me, that the very people who are so strongly against abortion, are the same ones against government-funded, pre-natal care and government-sponsored   health care   services to the poor-including   food   stamps and financial help to   kids   who have no   health insurance  ! Force the poor girl who has no way to provide for the child or was rapedto the pro-lifers, it doesn't matter-she must have that unwanted child!Over population is a major threat to our world and our standard of liv-ing!  I encourage abortion as a means of keeping the population under control-especially in 3rd and 5th world countries. Adoption, is a viable alternative and should be examined. Encouraging women who already have too large a family to support, to not have an abortion, is iimmoral and a further strain against the social welfare system in much oof the world. Keep in mind, that a lot of these poor, uneducated women, are the sole breadwinner-the husbands have deserted the family, or died of   AIDS   like in sub-Saharan Africa for example.  Why bring another child in the world to face hopeless   poverty   and misery when the woman could make an informed decision and have her pregnacy terminated.These pro-lifers in the U.S. are so disconnected to the real world-living in wealthy suburbs and   driving   SUV's-have no idea what its like ffor these poor women live day to day trying to feed and cloth their kids! Its so immoral that it makes me so sick!  They feel that it doesn't matter that these kids with bloated stomachs, living in filth, arfe better off than had their Mother had the abortion. I know thats a terrible thing to say but thats the reality for over a billion   children   iin the world who go hungry and have no future!"
1,"I personally do not approve of   abortion   that is my opinion.That does not mean I shuold have the right to make that choice for anyone esle.That is right it is none of anyone esle's business.It should be up to the person facing the choice.Ok if you don't believe in an abortion DON""T get one and leave jane doe alone if she does again none of your business!!"
2,"When we grant American dollars to foreign family planning clinics that use “their private, non-US funds” for abortions, we still indirectly fund   abortion  . There is no way around this, as giving such an organization funds for any of their other services frees up their private, non-US funds for abortions that would otherwise be used on the other services. If we pay their electric bill, the   money   they budgeted for it can now be used for anything, including abortions.To the millions of Americans who believe that life begins at conception this means we have funded killing the most defenseless members of our   society  . I doubt their blood will easily wash off our hands."
2,"Imagine reading a headline that says After 8 years of Injustice, Slavery has been Restored"" or After 12 years of Injustice, Hitler has Come Back Into Power"".  Insanem, wouldn't those two   headlines   be, well the same applies to the   abortion   issue.  All three have the same thing in common, people thought the lives of the innoncent were not worth saving.  Parents went around saying I would never own a slave, but they can own all they want, or I would never kill those people but they country can kill all they want.  We just have to see how hard medical   science   is fighting to come up with birth control for men, the day after pill, and so many other birth control methods to realize that they know a fetus which means ""Little One"" is a baby.  We also know that many, many people suffer after having an abortion, men and women.  What makes all the folks who look the other way any better than the folse who looked the other way with child abuse, be it a bishop, teacher, political party, family member or friend.  Why can Planned Parenthood not report a rape, or when a fivteen year old teenager has had sex with a man over the age of twenty-one.  Do all these people who support abortion really believe they are doing the right thing?  Hasn't history proved that many of these people suffer the rest of their lives?  Do any really believe that these people don't do drugs to forget, want to kill themselves.  Who will these people sue twenty years from now?  Planned Parenthood, Political Parties, or will they want to go after the Church again and claim that we did not fight hard enough to prevent it?  Anyone who is for abortion should look at the films of a baby being aborted, before saying they are for abortion.  Anyone who has had an abortion should seek out help, there are many web sites who can help.    www.priestsforlife.org  , sistersforlife.com,   www.touchedbyabortion.com   If after you have seen some of the films of the babies being aborted, or read some of the stories from those who have had abortions you still the same way, then at least you have researched both sides of the issue aand can make a informed judgment.  Why should they start a baby and then abort it for stem cell research when they are having better results with adult cell research from our own bodies.  Don't be like the slave sellers, slave owners or slave ship captains.  Don't be like the people in Hitler's Germany who looked the other way because they did not have all the facts or went along with the crowd even thought they though it was wrong.  Look at the video wherein a child is in the womb and his father leaves him and his mother give birth to him anyway even thought he will be in a poor family.  If you watch the video you will be amazed to realize that President Obama is that fetus that could have been aborted.     "
2,"Whether one is 'right to life' or supports a 'right to an   abortion  ', there can be no sensible argument that citizens of foreign countries have a right which would compel the government to spend American tax dollars on family planning which includes promoting abortion.  Frankly, those citizens do not have a right to any funding whatsoever.  We provide funds as an act of charity.   Our doing so is supererogatory.  It is not the fulfillment of a duty.  If we choose to fund aid efforts, then our donations should be allocated in a way that is consonant with the values of our people.  When one takes into account that approximately half of the country opposes abortion, and a great many (which would feature prominently among this group [in spite of Mr. O Brien's protestations] American Catholics) would consider abortion to be the moral equivalent of murder, it becomes obvious that it was wrong to overturn the Mexico City Policy.  A member of theSociety for Pro-Life Agnostics and Secular Humanists  />SplashForLife@gmail.com  "
1,"Those who   abortion   should never be allowed under any circumstance are in a significant minority. Although to be fair, numbers wise, usually so are those who think abortion should be legal in all circumstances. The majority of people allow much more wiggle room. So based on your premise of being ""consonant with the values of our people"" repealing the Mexico City act was correct.My information was taken from this site which publishes all the major polls carried out by the various news and polling organizations.   http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm  "
2,"Your remark raises a valid point- which is that opposing   abortion   with no exceptions (which is not a view that I take personally) is supported by a small percent of the population, as is support for abortion in any cricumstances.  If you look at your own data, then 49% are clearly pro-choice and 47% are clearly pro-life.  Given a 3-4% margin of error, I think that there is no reason to regard this as a contradiction of my original thesis regarding a country which is split pretty evenly in half.  The question raised by the Mexico City Policy (MCP) was whether or not we should give financial support abroad to groups that would counsel women to have abortions as a form of family planning.  If half of the country would oppose this, then it cannot be consistent with our countries values.  It is consistant with half of the country and opposed by half.  Furthermore, poll data dealing specifically with the MCP shows that Obama's change in policy was supported by only about a third (35%) of the country- which makes it his least popular action to date.  -see link to Gallup poll below-  http://www.gallup.com/poll/114091/Americans-Approve-Obama-Actions-Date.aspx  "
1,"I read through all the polls and basically there is no clear majority for one extreme or the other which is exactly why I said the majority has more wiggle room. The only way repealing the MCP could not be seen as being in consonance with the will of the majority is if the default is given to one side or the other in the case of an equal split. When the MCP was legislated, it created a false majority for the pro life side by having their views be the default opinion representing the citizens of this country. Repealing the MCP just puts things back to where they should be: no legislative bias for either side. Now, international groups from both sides of the issue can fairly petition for some of this aid. "
2,"If there is not a majority for either the   pro-life   or pro-choice position, then it does not make sense to say that the fair solution is to allow the government to spend American tax dollars on something which half of the country opposes.  For the pro-life side, legal abortion is an approximate moral equivalent of legal slavery.  (It treats human life as if it were the property of another.)  If one disagrees and believes that a woman's control of her body is so important that it justifies destroying human life, then that person is free to support theses groups by making an individual contributions.  It is absurd to suggest that there is no legislative bias either in favor or in opposition to abortion with the current policy when the current policy effectively compels everyone to underwrite the promotion of abortion.  The MCP was the fair solution."
1," Abortion allows women to become better people without a child  Rachel Kramer Bussel, ""I'm Pro-Choice and I Fuck"", Village Voice, January 13, 2006 - ""I'm pro-choice because I couldn't fully enjoy sex were I consumed with worry about the potential consequences. I'm pro-choice for all my friends who've had abortions and gone on to do great things, who are better women for being childless (for now). I'm pro-choice for the new moms and dads I know who were able to actively choose to become parents. I'm pro-choice for all those babies... born knowing they're 100 percent loved and wanted.""[12]
"
1,"In what way is underwriting the views of the pro life side fair to the pro choice side? This is what the MCP did, said the default position should be the pro life, which ignores the view and rights of the pro choice side. Removing the MCP allows institutions in other countries on both sides of the issue to petition for aid. There is nothing implicitly stating that all the aid is going to institutions that only promote abortions, it simply allows them the same right which pro life entities have (exclusively under the MCP). the MCP was completely undemocratic by refusing any chance to ask for aid to those who promote   abortion  .Besides the bad allegory of abortion to slavery, you start with a false premise that everyone agrees on when human life begins. This is not the case, where as with slavery there is no confusion about what is wrong (and even that is a contemporary lack of confusion, because the states of succession certainly held a different point of view during that time).About individual contributions I agree that the same can be done for the pro life side as well. That's beside the point. If federal aid is being given out there is no reason that it should favor one side over the other, if done in consonance with how our country feels about this question than the aid money will be split fifty - fifty."
2,"You analysis is exactly backwards.  Overturning MCP will only make a difference if money is given to people who will advise women to use   abortion   as a means of family planning and campaign for changes in foreign law which would make abortion easier to get.  This is a de facto subsidy for abortion which is a way for the government to undermine the pro-life position of much of the population.  The MCP precluded this.  In other words, money was still given to family planning efforts (as a form of humanitarian aid) provided that it not support abortion, but it was not used to support a pro-choice agenda.  You are falsely equating not supporting a pro-choice agenda with advocating for the pro-life position.If the MCP had been designed so that it promoted campaigns to criminalize abortion and to advise women that they must not have abortions (or that abortion was immoral) then your point of view would make sense- but most of the groups that received funds under MCP were groups which merely stopped those activities which had been disallowed by the policy.  In other words, the MCP did not say that funding was only supporting a pro-life agenda and pro-life groups.  It funded groups that ceased advocacy of the pro-choice agenda.  The idea that they then began advocating a pro-life agenda is just silly.At any rate, your suggestion that only pro-life agencies received funds is just false on the face of it.  My use of the slavery analogy is not 'bad'.  It is accurate.  You can say that you disagree with people who say that the positions are analogous, which I am sure is true.  The pro-choice makes almost the same comparison in reverse- by claiming that women are 'enslaved' when abortion is denied them.  My statement was that, ""For the pro-life side, legal abortion is an approximate moral equivalent of legal slavery.""  Whether abortion is morally equivalent to slavery in some abstract universal sense is open to debate.  Whether or not those who are pro-life judge it equivalent isn't."
2,"You wrote, ""If federal aid is being given out there is no reason that it should favor one side over the other, if done in consonance with how our country feels about this question than the aid money will be split fifty - fifty.""That is an interesting position.  It is one which frankly I've never thought of or heard before.  I suppose it would be 'fair', in terms of representing the public will.We could send money to groups abroad that counsel individuals to get abortions and campaign for   pro-choice   laws, and then send the same amount of money that tell women that they shouldn't get abortions and campaign for pro-life laws.It is an interesting idea.That would be even-handed and in a sense equitable.  I think that the MCP's way of achieving neutrality is more practical.Your suggestion would result in our money essentially 'balancing itself out'.  It would also ratchet up the level of conflict- sort of like arming two warring factions equally.  I'm not sure if that would be good (although I don't know if it would be bad either).It probably would not be a good use of tax dollars though.  It also would not be likely to further the humanitarian goals of our aid program."
1,"""today signed an order that exports the torture of unborn children around the world""Sensationlist tripe with no grounding in reality whatsoever. ""Family Research Council"" indeed. Humans have lives for thousands of years in families and communities unaided and yet we see this body claiming to know and represent what family values are. What a joke!"
1,"The name ""Family Research Counsel"" is an oxymoron. They don't do research; they preach lies.This is a Fundamentalist Christian front group. The core principle of Fundamentalism is that every word of the Bible is literally true and without error. The core principle of Fundamentalism is fraud. If you attempted to sell a product as clearly defective as that, in any business but art or   religion  , you would go to prison.  Once you have a group of people who have committed the   faith   of their lives to a lie, you can get them to go to bat for any damned-fool proposition.  For 25 years these deceivers have distorted and distracted Americans from the proper business of government, which is business. The Family Research Council  loved George W. Bush, who arrogantly believed that he had the God-given right to   torture    people after they were born but that no one should have the right to abort a fetus, because of his primitive religion. That sad, era, of ignorance and arrogance, is over.Now they attempt to undermine the Obama administration that promises   science  -based public policy, which should be an opportunity for a ""research"" shop, except, of course, that they have no research only lies, distorted by ideology. FRC offers nothing that can stand up to critical examination, which is no problem for true-believers but doesn't fly well outside their cult.  America has listened to these pied-pipers for far too long; where they led our country is the wrong direction.

1,"Who knows, maybe this is a good time for the NRLC to rethink it's purpose. I recently read this article (link is at the end) ct. 15, 2008 -- The U.S. ranks 29th worldwide in infant mortality, tying Slovakia and Poland but lagging behind Cuba, the CDC reports.The CDC's latest estimates for international rankings are based on 2004 data. But as of 2005, the numbers haven't changed much since 2000.Nearly seven U.S. babies die out of every 1,000 live births. More than 28,000 American babies die before their first birthday.""The U.S. infant mortality rate is higher than rates in most other developed countries,"" note CDC researchers Marian F. MacDorman, PhD, and T.J. Mathews. ""The relative position of the United States in comparison to countries with the lowest infant mortality rates appears to be worsening.""What's going on? Racial and ethnic disparities clearly play a role. In 2005, for every 1,000 live births, the infant mortality rate was:    * 13.63 among non-Hispanic black Americans    * 5.76 among non-Hispanic white AmericansPremature birth is a factor in more than two-thirds of infant deaths. From 2000 to 2005, the U.S. preterm birth rate went up from 11.6% to 12.7%.Rather than spend so much time, energy and resources (both human and financial) on stopping women from having abortions, why not dedicate yourselves to helping solve some of the problems above? There are millions of women wanting to have babies and are facing real obstacles and traumas as the numbers above show. Just something to consider.The whole article can be found here.  http://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20081015/infant-mortality-us-ranks-29th  "
1,"Why do you refer to ""the U.S. 'population assistance' program""? I don't know what that program is. The Mexico City Policy applies/applied to federal funding to NGOs. It was announced by Reagan at the 1984 UN International Conference on Population, so maybe that is the source of the mix-up. I don't believe there is any specific program with funding for ""population assistance,"" whatever that means, but if you know of one I'd be very interested to see some details.I also think that Johnson's statements are misleading, particularly the reference to ""groups that promote   abortion   as a method of population control."" Any time someone makes a choice about getting pregnant, not getting pregnant, carrying a pregnancy to term, or not carrying the pregnancy to term, they are doing something that controls the population. Granted, these decisions are on an individual level, so it may seem like no one really has ""control"" -- but that's the level on which NGOs providing OB/GYN and prenatal services would be working, too. You make it sound as though there is some kind of conspiracy to abort a quota of fetuses -- this is obviously ridiculous."

1,"Abortion rights is an important issue, and it is typically presented (as in this debate) as a complex topic involving women's right, women's health, the doctor-patient relationship, government interference, social policy, historical precedent, biblical interpretation, etc.  But in the end none of this is relevant.  The root question is ""When does life begin?"" If you believe that life begins at conception (I do not), then there can be no justification for abortion, just as there can be no justification for murder.  In this case, abortion must be illegal in ALL cases.  Ethically, exceptions cannot be made, even for cases of rape, incest, or the health of the mother just as we cannot murder one innocent person to save the life of another.  It seems to me that ""Pro-lifers"" who allow these exceptions are contradicting themselves, because there are no exceptions to rules against murder.  But if you believe that life does not begin at conception, then abortion (at least until the point at which you believe life does begin) has no ethical component, and should be legal as a matter of personal choice.  I don't know when life begins.  But I do know that it is NOT at conception, or any time soon thereafter.  For me life is not based my interpretation of when the soul inhabits the body. It is based on when consciousness begins.  And that cannot happen AT LEAST until there is a functioning brain.  No matter what anyone claims, at this point NO ONE knows when life beings.  Clearly this is a matter that has been debated for thousands of years, and on which we all have opinions (most of them strong).  But that's the point, they are OPINIONS, not facts.  Our philosophy and science have simply not come far enough to give an unambiguous answer to this question, leaving it (for most people) in the realm of faith. And since the nature of life IS a matter of opinion at this point, abortion should also remain a matter of opinion...and choice.  Much of this needs elaboration, but it's a good place to start.  Sid"
1,"Mike said ""I think you're thinking of personhood, because there is simply no question about whether or not you are ending a life. "". Yes, I was referring to ""personhood"" throughout my post.  The idea of ""life"" in and of itself is not important to this debate.  This sound's strange, I know, but many things are ""alive"" that as a society we have no compunctions about killing. Many animals for food, insects as pests, skin cells when we scrape our knee.  All of these things are alive, but killing them is (for most of us) not controversial.   We even let people die when they are in a vegetative state (most of the time).  So ""life"" is not the standard for the debate on abortion.  The standard must be HUMAN life, which I treat as synonymous with ""personhood"".  With respect to a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus, the question is When does it become a person?  Certainly not at conception, by my way of thinking.  Possibly not until birth.  Arguably sometime in between.  But aside from chronological definitions, the acquisition of higher consciousness characteristic of humans from birth onward is my functional definition.  I just don't know when that happens.  And since no one else does either, we should leave up to each of us.  Sid"

2,"We can't ignore medical science.At 21 days, the heartbeat can be heard.  At 40 days, brain activity can be detected.In a hospital, these are often used to determine the beginning and end of life.  So if the cessation of these is the definition of dead, should we adpot these as the beginning of life?  Would you therefore banning all abortions after 21 days?  40 days?"
1,"DominicSavio said ""At 21 days, the heartbeat can be heard. At 40 days, brain activity can be detected.""Maybe.  But a heartbeat is not the essential characteristic of human life.  All animals have heartbeats, but we kill them all the time.  And even humans in persistent vegetative states also have heartbeats but are often allowed to die precisely because it is the mind, not the heart that defines human life.  The same can be said for brain activity.  It is not enough to have an ""active"" brain.  Animals have those, too.  The brains of humans in vegetative states also have active parts (the parts that keep there lungs and heart pumping, for example).  It must be a brain with consciousness, awareness, person-ness.  And since there is no clear definition of when that begins, or even what it is, I reject those criteria.  (Aside: 59.3% of abortions in the U.S. are performed at 8 weeks of gestation of less (Wikipedia). That's 56 days, which is pretty close to your 40 day suggestion.  So probably close to half of abortions might be acceptable to you, right?)Sid"
1,"While most of your argument is very good, I do have a problem with you denying that   abortion   to save the life of a mother cannot be valid if you believe the fetus to be a person.  If there is a car crash, and two people are somehow fused together in such a way that one will live and the other will die if seperated, but if left together both will die, then the doctor has a tough decision to make, but ultimately should make.  One must be saved and one must die.  This is the same scenario as if an abortion occured to save the life of the mother.  Being as the mother usually has a higher chance of survival, it is usually wise to save her rather than the baby.  Granted, at that point, it is the doctor's decision.  As far as the other extenuating circumstances, you are right, they have no justification.  I also disagree with your apparent belief that we should err on the side of liberty over life.  I would place life before liberty, and would rather risk denying someone a freedom they should have had to try and save someone's life than deny someone a life they should have had to try and save someone's freedom."
1,"""I would place life before liberty, and would rather risk denying someone a freedom they should have had to try and save someone's life than deny someone a life they should have had to try and save someone's freedom.""which is odd, you being a military man.    we've argued this before... but now that i know you're pre-military, it has all the more meaning.  how can you be going into such a position where liberty is extended over life?  give me liberty or give me death.freedom isn't free.a thousand other cliches....     life without liberty is a poor, sad life.   not much of a life at all."
1,"As I reread my own comment, I did realize that that seemed a bit off, even before I read yours, which pointed it out.  I think the clarification needs to be made with consciousness.  If someone willingly risks their life for freedom, and does in fact lose it, he or she has made the choice to sacrifice their life for freedom.  If someone chooses to oppose freedom, and strives to take it from another, it is within the rights of those whose freedom is being taken to take his of her life in defense of their own freedom.  A fetus, however, is created, in the vast majority of cases, by the actions of its   parents  .  Nature has chosen the mother to bear the biological burden of childbearing. (except in the case of seahorses, but I digress)  A fetus does not intentionally limit a woman's rights, nor does it seek to limit her freedom.  Unfortunately,   evolution   has made the fetus dependant on the mother.  What must also be taken into account is the amount of liberty being taken.  Conquest by fascists would be an incredible violation of freedom.  Freedom to work, live, move about freely, all of the Bill of Rights, national sovereignty, all would be utterly and permanently destroyed.  Bearing a child requires giving up some of the freedom to one's own body for a mere nine months.  The taking of one being's life, who has done nothing to warrant its destruction except for being formed as a side effect of it's parents' actions, for the sake of that small liberty cannot be justified.Of course, what immediately comes to mind is collateral damage.  The loss of innocent life as a result of   war   is horrifying, and should act to deter nations from unnecessary fighting.  It is however, a fact of war, and if a war must be fought, every step should be taken to minimize it.  That being said, one cannot fail to do what is necessary for fear of the negative consequences.  Chemotherapy is horrifying, but it is better than the alternative.  Collateral damage differs from   abortion   in that abortion in several ways.  The first is in the degree of the freedoms at stake, which have been mentioned above.  The second is intent.  Killing a fetus in cold blood is different from killing a civilian in a warzone on accident.  In civilian courts, it is the diffence between   murder   and manslaughter, in a military court, it is the difference between an accident and a war   crime  .  Collateral damage wil happen so long as there is war.  That is an excellent reason to try for peace, but unfortunately violent measures must sometimes be employed in the defense of both life and liberty.  Abortion, on the other hand, is necessary only to preserve the rights of a woman to her body for a very short period of time.  In cases where two people's rights collide, one must look both at the difference in severity of the rights in question, and at who has the greater claim.  I would argue that a fetus has greater right to life than a woman has to her body, and a nation has a greater right to life and all liberty than the soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen who sacrifice both for it, than the enemy combatant who emperils both to end it, and the innocent civilian who was simply in the ewrong place at the wrong time."
1,"Which is the actual length of time, really.  40 weeks, in general.  I make the claim that it wrong to force a woman (by means of either allowing or disallowing action) to be imprisoned to her body for any reason.  More over, I find the claim that we must allow only medical actions that agree with nature to be preposterous considering the whole point of medical advancement has been to thwart nature.And if you find that it is acceptable to force a woman to give up her freedom for however long because it means that one life might live, you find it acceptable to say one person's life can not be free.... and this then applies to all people - including the life that freedom was tossed aside for.   Which makes little sense.If you say one person has no right to freedom because it's only for a short time, you make it allowable for every person to be enslaved to another for only a short period of time.  Freedom doesn't work that way.  Either you are free (in so far as the use of your body by others), or you are unfree.  This is one reason why Vietnam was so opposed.  Because you had thousands, literally, who were enslaved by the government.   And further to that, men like Cheney and Bush and Clinton and a host of others were able to buy their way out this enslavement.   Which speaks further to injustice. You join the military because you want to.   If you were forced into it against your will and principles of what you believe (for if you believed in the   war  , you would have enlisted), would you still hold that your life was worth less than others?  And if you hold that your life is worth less than others lives, why then should you try and force your belief upon me?  I owe my life to no one.  To be forced to owe my life to someone, even for a short period of time, means that I have no individual right.   This is the very foundation of this country... that I have the right of an individual.   I think I have said though, that if it determined that the fetus is viable - or even if the medical community is unsure but there is a possibility of it being saved, there is little difference between an   abortion   and a c-section.   If the woman does not want to give up her freedom and owe her life to a fetus, there is more than one option of abortion, at some point, that doesn't enslave the woman.  If this is the case, then it becomes the responsibility of us all to ensure that the life of the fetus IS protected.   This doesn't mean the woman must remain pregnant.... it simply means a change in procedure.   However, if this is the case - which I think it is.... it is not the woman who bears the burden of this extra cost, but the   society   that says life should be protected.    "
1,"I think we need to introduce to this conversation a definition of freedom.  Freedom is not the ability to do whatever you want.  That's anarchy.  In a free   society  , everyone has ""inalienable rights"" that are protected by the government.  Sometimes, those inalienable rights are mutually exclusive.  For example, if someone buys something, it his property by right, and it is absolutely wrong to take it away.  At the same time, people have a right to freedom from slavery, and it is absolutely wrong to violate that right.  So if a someone buys another person, we have a problem.  On the one hand, the first has an inalienable right to his (or her) property.  On the other, the second has an equally inalienable right to his/her liberty.  Both cannot be.  It is absolutely wrong to keep slaves, but it is absolutely wrong to confiscate an individuals property.  What to do?  Fortunately, this nation made a decision that the right to liberty trumps the right to property.  As you well know, this was not always the case.  Now, you rightly argue that it is absolutely wrong to force a woman to be imprisoned in her own body for any reason.  I agree with this, but by the same token, it is absolutely wrong to kill her child for any reason.  The   pregnancy   cannot rightfully be terminated, and cannot rightfully be allowed to continue.  Alas, both cannot be.  In this situation, one must consider which has the greater claim to his or her rights.  This is the only situation in which it is acceptable to consider the extent and length of the limitations of freedoms.  I would argue that the fetus, assuming that it is a person, has a greater   right to life   than its mother has to her right to reproductive freedom.I fail to see where you are trying to go with your little ""the government enslaved Americans back in Nam"" rant.  Are you referring to the draft?Also, you seem to suggest I said some things that I did not.  The first is the comment about natural medical procedures near the beginning.  I never said anything about abortion being ""unnatural"" or anything like that.  I support   genetic   engineering, cloning, adult stem cell research, Frankenfoods, etc.  The only reason I am opposed to infant stem cell research is the necessity of killing a fetus to conduct said research.  I really don't give a shit about whether something is ""natural.""  The second is the claim that somewhere in this conversation I said that my life was ""less valuable"" than other Americans.  I never said that, not once, or even implied that.  And where do you get off questioning my support for the   war   based on my enlistment status?  Because I didn't enlist right out of high school I obviously don't believe in the war?  What?  You don't know the circumstances, and you can't make judgements like that without signifigantly more information than you have been given."
1,"it does appear to be a catch-22 (have you read that book?... great book. ""there's a dead man in my tent."").that's why i proposed that if the medical community thinks it worth the cost and effort to support the life... it's a different procedure altogether and frees the woman from the enslavement of a forced   pregnancy   (as in: laws that ban aborted pregnancies).  that's the whole point.  that's what i've been trying to get across.  come on. it was the last thing i said, k.r.  there are some people on here that think that because i will never - under any circumstances... and i don't care if it meant that ten million babies would die - support the forced use of one person's body for the needs, wants, or expectations of another.  for whatever reason.... who think that because i would never support that, obviously i just don't give two shits about life and innocent beings. obviously, that's not true.  liberty and life are not separate issues.  life without liberty (and screw all the other kinds....  it's the freedom of simple BEING that we are talking about) is essentially meaningless.   this doesn't mean the freedom to walk around punching people in the face.  it is the freedom to walk around without being told that you may or may not walk around.  it is the freedom to speak without being told what to say or when and how to say it. This. THIS is the freedom that i am speak of.  the ultimate right of choice over one's own body.  OWN body. not that of others.   it is the right for which you have said you are willing to die for to ensure that is possible for others.  that is your choice.   if you had that choice made for you - as the drafted boy-soldiers of vietnam had it made for them - it wouldn't be free, would it? in fact, if you were drafted into the army, mr. richardson, you would be enslaved to your own country.   this is an issue of freedom, yes.but this isn't JUST about ""reproductive"" freedom, mr. richardson.  it is the freedom of the whole woman.    if you ban   abortion  , you reduce women down to merely their wombs and what they can do and define the woman as merely that:  a reproductive organ housed in skin and bone and muscle topped off with a useless brain.   the woman's woman parts are greater than the sum of her whole is what you then say.  i say: would you feel the same way if it were you? would you say: I I, say the I with feeling!!!I am worth less than my womb.    (ARE you worth less then one part of you? Is your freedom?)I am less than my womb.I have no right to do as I please [with my body] for the sake of my womb because nature has designated my womb to be the carrier.  how does that make you feel to know that you are worth less than a single part of you?...... mr. richardson, i never said you said abortion was unnatural. i mentioned nature and   medical science   because you did say it's merely nature that designs a woman to carry the child.   you say the child has no choice.   did i choose to be a woman? did you choose to be a man?   we had no choice in our sex.   i have a choice to not bear a child, though.  that is the freedom i have over my body, though i chose not the form.  it doesn't matter intent of lack of intent or accident or design of nature when a fetus is inside the womb....  if MY freedom is at stake... I have a right to keep it. my body IS my choice.  again. see the last paragraph.  because there are choices in the choice..... abortion is one until the life of the growing fetus outweighs the demands of freedom of the mother.  but that doesn't mean you can simply allow the enslavement of one individual to another.  it means that the medical community that has provided women with a safe means to something women have been doing for thousands of years must provide an alternative.  that's all.     there needn't be a catch-22.... there doesn't have to be a dead man in your tent, so to speak.you're the only person i feel like i can actually speak with about this subject (who doesn’t just agree with me). so, you know... if you're still thinking i'm saying you're saying things you're not. well then, just tell me.  i do sometimes read things wrong.   i'm not fucking perfect."

1,"The truth of the matter is that it is entirely un-American to force one's viewpoints onto others. This is exactly what would be happening if we ban abortion, gay marriage, physician assisted suicide, etc. There are many Americans, all with different beliefs, customs, and traditions. To say that one way of thought is better than another alienates entire spectrums of beliefs. More importantly, it is completely un-American to take away the right to choose from over half of the American population based on the opinions of less than 1/3 of the population. I say 1/3 because that seems to be the usual percentage of Americans in agreement with the proposed initiative.We need to stop thinking of only ourselves and our beliefs and begin to consider the effect that proposing such a ban would cause. This is not simply pro-life vs. pro-choice. It is about remembering that one 1/3 of the nation's opinion should not infringe upon the rights of the entire nation.If one believes that abortion is wrong, the simple solution would be to not partake in an abortion."
1," No woman ""wants"" an abortion; it is only the least bad alternative Women do not ""want"" abortions. They find themselves in a position in which abortion is the less bad between bad alternatives. This argument is important in explaining that abortion is not about a malicious desire to ""kill babies"" or even to express their right to choose; it is about allowing women to make the best choice that they can.
"
2,"Hmmm...so if I don't believe that thievery is wrong, I should just choose not to do it?  Or, maybe murder?  Obviously one who believes    abortion    to be immoral will not, if consistent, ""partake"" in it.  But that is not the issue; the issue concerns the taking the life of an innocent human being.By the way, if gay marriage laws are passed, and I'm to live under those laws, is that not ""un-American"" by your definition.  After all, that viewpoint has been forced on me, against my wishes."
1,"Plainsman, Perhaps I failed to word my post to correctly show the basis of my   pro-choice   stance. Therefore, I will attempt to do so now.The issue of abortion is one which goes much deeper than pro-life v. pro-choice. The issue at hand is taking away the choice to commit an act which is completely private. My ultimate concern is that banning abortion essentially strips women of their right to choose. This, in itself, is completely against everything that America, in my opinion, stands for. So, I would like to step past the argument that the issue at hand is ""taking the life of an innocent human being"".One of the main elements of America that makes it so great is the reality that the state respects the right to privacy and ensures American citizens freedom. Therefore, I believe that when these freedoms, the right to choose, and the rights of American citizens to live without the government infringing upon their private lives are stripped away we being to regress into one of the many societies which we speak out against every day.The issue of living under laws which one disagrees with is in my opinion an erroneous one. We as Americans, must ensure that every person maintains the right to privacy and the freedom to choose as long as those rights and freedoms do not infringe upon the rights and freedoms of others. Allowing for women, if they so choose, to get an abortion in no way infringes upon the rights of other American citizens.  The same is true for gay marriages. Furthermore, allowing women to choose whether or not to receive an abortion is in no way forcing a viewpoint onto the entire populace. However, forbidding the right to choose does exactly that.Stripping American citizens of their rights is a very dangerous game. We must remember our roots and ensure that we do not begin stripping away at the layers of freedom. America, after all, was created to ensure that people maintain freedom and that the state can in no way infringe upon those freedoms.Banning abortion like banning gay marriage is a very slippery slope and speeds up the possibility of America regressing into that which we fought and continue to fight so hard against."
1,"Most of what you said is absolutely correct.  This is a place of freedom, and restricting freedoms that don't harm anyone else goes against the grain of what this country was founded on.  That is why I am for legalization of marjuana and other drugs, for the rights of homosexuals, for the unrestricted right of the people to bear arms, and against all ""victimless crimes.""  Abortion, however, is not one of these things.   An innocent life is being destroyed.  While you certainly can make a good argument for   abortion   early in the pregnancy, and there is no reason to restrict birth control, once a feltus begins to kick and play, to respond to voices and sounds, to show emotion, it is a person, and it's inalienable right to life is being infringed.  Americans not only should but must insure that as long as rights and freedoms do not infringe upon the rights and feedoms of others they are protected.  Abortion, however, is not without a victim.  It does infringe upons the rights and freedoms of another.  This is why it should not be legal.  That being said, it also should not be banned.  What I would recommend happen, is that Congress makes a Constitutional Amendment defining at what point a specimen of the human race becomes a person and achieves citizenhood, and with that citizenhood Constitutional protection, with said point occuring at some point between conception and birth, probably late in the pregnancy.  After this point, termination of the child, as it would then be defined, would be classified as murder, and not abortion.  After that amendment is ratified, the policy as to whether termination of the human specimen prior to that point is legal or not should be left to the states.  In an ideal world, abortion of all kind would be illegal.  However, this is not the case, and this is the most reasonable compromise I can come up with."
1,"Your first statement is mostly valid.  Your second, regarding gay marriage, is not.  America is a Democratic-Republic, and as such, policy is the will of the people.  A vital aspect for the survival of a Democratic system of government is that the people consent to live by the decision of the majority.  This is often referred to as ""majority rules.""  Furthermore, that viewpoint would not have been ""forced"" onto you.  You are allowed to keep you dissenting position, you are just not allowed to lead an armed rebellion or attempt to undermine the system just because you did not get your way.  Furthermore, you are not being asked to marry someone of the same gender, so what do you care?  His point seems to be that passing an initiative though it received a minority of the vote would be un-American, and it would be.  What he fails to take into account is Federalism.  If most of the people of South Dakota want to ban   abortion  , it is the right of the State to ban it."
1,"Yes the majority rules but our founding documents are there to protect the minority from the excesses of the majority. In other words, What makes our constitution and the bill of rights different is that there are limits to what a majority can do. States do have individual rights but only up to a certain point. Since Roe v Wade protects the privacy of the individuals in relation to   abortion  , states do not have the right to act against it, just as (to use an absurd example) no state, today, could legally allow any form of slavery to be practiced. We have federal laws against it. Regards to a previous post of yours:It's hard to follow the logic of those against choice, with few exceptions. The reason is, it is so selective and based on this one aspect: abortion, a question, that in a real sense, really only has direct implications on the females of our society (I'm only talking about the ability to produce life since men can't. I am not referring to raising and rearing of a child and all the implication that has on both men and women in terms of the financial, mental / physical well being of the child). But if defining life and protecting life is so important why do we put so many restrictions on dealing with the question.Here's a list:1) the first cause of life. If life is a continual process why stop at the fertilization of the egg by the sperm? My sperm is life in potential. A woman's egg is life in potential. Yet, nature has the female eject unused eggs every month. And well, men...2) Many fertilized eggs are naturally aborted against people's will and we have many techniques for helping them although some of them will have to live their lives without being able to bear children. Why should we make an exception for the induced abortions and force people to have babies they don't want to have?3) Why is only human life so important when there is a strong interconnectedness to all life on the planet?4) What about war and the death penalty - both are cases where we justify the taking of life - how will our future constitutional amendment about life affect these things?I'm sure there are more things but this a good place to start when trying to define the philosophical and moral attitudes we should have about life."
1,I just want to say I am   pro life   in these matters. If I knock up a girl I would want to keep the baby. Mostly due to my superior physical genetics;) However I am grateful for the CHOICE to keep him/her. Because of that I am pro choice. If somebody wants to have a word that rymes whith shushmorshin then let them. Odds are they will be filled with guilt and anguish that will cause more of a hardship than the child ever would have. I am and will remain however pro free will aka pro choice. Love it or hate it other people have a choice too.

Does life begin in the 30th week of gestation?  I don't know...maybe.  My point is that the beginning of life cannot be defined by means of oversimplified developmental stages, like conception or birth, or by arbitrary physiological criteria like heartbeat.  Human life must be defined functionally, based on the acquisition of higher order consciousness/awareness, which are hallmarks of the human mind, and essential characteristics of human beings vs. other animals.  At this point, those concepts are strictly philosophical since science cannot even define them clearly, let alone state with certainty when they begin.  I realize this is a hot-button issue, especially in view of the deep religious views of most Americans. I also realize that it is psychologically satisfying to have simple black-and-white answers to important issues. But this does not justify sweeping, blanket pronouncements by either side in the absence of supporting facts.  I'm afraid we just have to live with the uncertainty, and keep our laws flexible enough to accommodate it.  Sid"

""Life is life whether we believe in it or not.""what does that mean? that no matter what the facts turn out to be you will deny reality and leave your opinion to be guided by this ""belief""? And what if you were born in a country that had no restrictions on   abortion   whatsoever, then you would believe that way.

1,"I just recently was pregnant with a   baby   that had a fatal condition called anencephaly. This is a ntd where the brain and top of the skull do not form. I was told that my baby would die once it was born, if it was not stillborn.I could not emotionally handle carrying a baby for 4 more months that I knew would die. I could not sit at home in a bubble and be depressed. I have responsibilies like my daughter to take care of as well as work and school.Medicaid would not allow me to deliver the baby early in the hospital. SO YES I HAD AN ABORTION BY ANOMALY. No woman should have to carry a baby that she knows will die immediately after birth. Anyone who wants to ban abortions will ban all abortions..even the ones that women need!"
1,"This is a weak argument that appeals to emotion and does not in any way address the consequences of this law.  Fine, try to prevent women from aborting their down syndrome babies - what are you going to do with these unwanted people?  Abandoning genetically deformed infants to a shoddy state system is humane?  How do you figure?  The problem, in my view, with all anti-abortion arguments is that they're about abortion is right or wrong.  That is almost completely irrelevant, the debate here is about whether abortion should be legal or not.  If you think abortion is wrong and want to prevent it, fine.  Making it illegal will not prevent abortion.  The numbers throughout the world conclusively show that the legal status of abortion does not affect the rates of abortion.  The availability of contraception does.  Criminalizing abortion will mean lots of illegal and potentially unsafe abortions, likely *increasing* the numbers of people who die.  How is that pro-life?  If you want to protect the precious unborn babies, offer some support to mothers with unwed pregnancies.  Get out there and advocate for freely available, low-cost or free birth control.  You can't say that you want to stop abortion and try to prevent contraception from being available at the same time, at least not if you want to be consistent.  This is something that seems to happen more and more, unfortunately, particularly with the move to reclassify contraception as abortion and also make it more difficult to get, typically a position advocated by supposed ""pro-life"" folks.  Get real.  If you're against Roe v. Wade, you're pro-dead mothers, not against abortion.  If you, like me, find abortion to be morally troubling, you should be focusing on more widely available contraception."
2,"you ever hear of adoption? Check into the amount of couples that are trying to adopt sometime. ""Genetically deformed"" and everything. The problem with you people is you don't see the baby as a real person. It's all about the poor innocent woman. Give me a break. NO sex, NO baby is the free available low-cost birth control. After that, you have responsibility. Remember that? It's the baby that is innocent in this whole issue, not the parent."
1,"In my (sadly, lengthy) experience with the women who are drug addicts, those that do not abort unwanted pregnancies very, very rarely put them up for adoption.  Instead they keep them in extremely dangerous and abusive home situations.  Even those that are given away are frequently born addicted to drugs, which is a tough way to start life.  For some reason pro-life arguments about the rights of the unborn child only seem to extend to its right to life; I've never heard anyone argue for a child's right to not be born virtually guaranteed to have a short, painful life of addiction.  I personally think that abortion is abhorrent and would never have one, but to criminalize just seems completely insane to me.  I've never had anyone actually answer my position, just launch off on the litany of what an awful person I am and how innocent the unborn are.  ""You people"" is exactly what I've come to expect."
1,"Yes, I have heard of adoption.  I think you'll find if you had actually read my comment and not just what you wanted to see, I never said that I thought abortion was right or good.  I was arguing about the legality of it.  Saying ""everyone should just be responsible"" is all well and good, but that's a completely absurd proposal to actually solve any problems.  You might as well say that the solution for our health care system is for people to just stop getting sick.  The housing crisis can easily be solved by everyone being more responsible with their money.I live in the real world, and in the real world criminalizing abortion does not help unborn babies, no matter how innocent.  It merely makes abortion unsafe.  I welcome your comments on the issue of how criminalizing abortion actually causes the loss of more lives.  If you want to take the stance that women who would seek abortion deserve to die, you are welcome to that opinion, but again it doesn't really seem to be pro-life.  "
1,"First, ""you people"" is not a very polite way of addressing people. Second, a baby implies birth has happened and no one disagrees about the human life of a baby. The problem is the pro life side trying to redefine a baby and moving it backwards until it means a zygote.Third, No sex may be a preferable way for you to live your life, I pass no judgment on that. However that is you, there are many of us that consider having sex a natural, healthy, beautiful fun experience and see no compelling reason why an accidental fertilization should be the standard of judging whether we are responsible people or not.Fourth, we have responsibility only after we have made the personal choice of keeping a fertilized egg."

The denigration of these values is the denigration of the human race.""And yet, if they are convicted felons, you throw your airs and graces about the sanctity of life out of the window in exchange for a swift execution. All of these erronous beliefs about   abortion   and sanctity of life stem from religion rather than reality. Life is not sacred. People die every single day from completely random issues. Just visit / work in a hospital for a day. Death is sad, but it is an inevitability and nobody is going to save you after you die. If someone bothered to pick up a science book now an again there simple wouldn't be any issues.Ultimately this is an argument between the educated and the uneducated. Controversy can only exist if both parties have a sound argument in the first place. As it stands the ""pro-lifers / anti-women's rights bridage"" have a lot of catching up to do."

It seems that we may be able to apply the same definition to the beginning of life. A fetus is not ""alive"" until it can live independent of its mother, in other words once it is born.

1,"Roe vs Wade hinges on the argument that a woman's medical treatments are private to her, not a moral judgement about the procedure. Many opponents of   abortion   feel that the justices just used privacy as a cover for their personal decision. Regardless, what they wrote is an individual right to medical privacy."
1,"""No matter which side you're on someone's morality is being forced upon others who disagree.""  People who are prolife just can't seem to grasp that neither the Supreme Court nor those who choose   abortion   are ""forcing their morality"" on people who are against abortion. If there were such things as forced abortions you would have an argument, but this is not the case. Roe vs Wade allows women to CHOOSE abortion. It also allows people to choose NOT to have an abortion. The problem is that Prolifers cannot let other people make choices they do not agree with. It's a simple concept: If you are against abortion,fine, don't have one. But don't tell me that my choice to have one ""forces my morality"" on you.  Although we can't all be constututional scholars, I do wish people making these arguments would actually read about Roe vs Wade and the related decisions before and since 1973, the 19th century Comstock laws, etc. Then and only then will you truly grasp the degree of oppression historically suffered by females in the US. Remember it has been less than 100 years since we achieved status as full citizens  with the right to vote.   Keep in mind that in 1963, Griswold vs. Connecticut struck down Connecticut's ban on all birth control. You say Roe vs Wade was ""not upholding constitutional   law  ."" That's a rather general statement where law is very, very precise. The big change that ocurred with Griswold vs. Connecticut, which is basically the precursor to Roe vs. Wade, is that a ""right to privacy"" was interpreted to exist in the ""living""   constitution  . This is the   legal   grounds that is challenged, even today. This means that if the prolife movement wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade,in effect saying that the constitution does not guarantee a right to privacy,  they will have to overturn Griswold vs. Connecticut on same basis, thereby allowing states to ban all forms of birth control. Most prolife people don't seem to understand this legal concept, and it is my observation that many of prolife leaders who do understand it are indeed against birth control also, but not nearly as vocal about it because that is a very unpopular prospect, based on deeply ingrained misogynist traditions in all three of the world's great religions. ""Fundamentalists' in all three religions are the problem,  make the most noise, and are frighteningly similar in misogynistic ideology. As a lively but ugly example,few prolifers know also about the outcry from fundamentalist Christians when epidurals for obstetric pain were introduced. They denounced epidurals since women were supposed to ""suffer in childbirth"" for Eve's part in Original Sin (Genesis.) Are the more radical among them really so different from the Taliban? I don't think so.The real question you need to answer is ""Does the government have the right to break down my door and supervise the choices I make in my bedroom, tell women that their male dominated government has decided that if they have sex, married or not, they must be prepared to have a child?"" I believe that it does not, that there IS a right to privacy inherent in our constitution. "

It Whether it's local or federal, someone is going to impose their morals on others.How about each individual decide for themselves? No need for anyone to worry about the others' morals because the decision is an individual decision.The state argument is just political rhetoric, because the pro lifers think they have a good chance of making   abortion   illegal in some states. ""by the people"", is obnoxious in this context when we already have by the individual."
1,"It's not a good compromise because there is not over whelming consensus, among scientists, theologies or philosophies that induced abortions are taking away human lives. Since abortions can also occur naturally, would it be considered involuntary manslaughter?Unfortunately just to think or believe something is so does not make it so. What you are trying to present as a compromise is nothing more than allowing the state to decide the morals rather than a federal judge, in this case, hoping that the some of the states will decide that your morals are better than the morals of others. This is not a compromise at all, just wishful thinking that the pro life side has in the attempt to gain a legal precedent in its favor.On what basis does the pro life side form their opinion that   abortion   is murder? On what basis do they define life? These are not questions for which one can just legislate answers. And to change the laws from what they are now, these questions have to be answered. I would like to see the philosophical, legal, theological and scientific proofs they have to reach their conclusion. Belief alone doesn't cut it for me, I mean come on, some people believe in the strangest of things and never have the least bit of evidence to support their beliefs.When dealing with a question as serious as this, we should expect a little more than some people's beliefs."
1,"  When the Supreme Court interpreted a ""right to privacy"" inherent in the 4th amendment of the Constitution in Griswold vs. Connecticut and Roe vs Wade, that meant that federal   law   under Constitution superceded states rights under 10th amendment. In other words, the Consitutional right to privacy took precedence. Since that time,Supreme Court decisions have allowed to states to enact limitations on   abortion  , which really is in lockstep with public opinion. As far as this latest poll saying the majority of Americans describe themselves as Pro Life, I don't buy it. One can get highly varied results in  polls depending on how the question is asked.  The other critical point is the ""life begins at conception"" argument. I personally don't believe that a fertilized egg is life, and think that this argument is totally unscientific, and simply reveals a misogynistic religious bias, even against birth control. Prolifers lose considerable credibility in saying that all abortions are ""killing babies."" Like most Americans, I believe abortion should be   legal  , and the sooner done the better. Plus there are numerous horrific instances that demand exceptions from all but the most callous religious zealots, such as child rape and incest, MUCH more common than the public has the stomach to acknowledge and condoned by Mormon Fundamentalists here in the USA.  In those cases the choice to force a child to have a baby is the worst kind of child abuse, tantamount to raping that child a second time. In the real world reproductive issues get messy and very ethically complex, making blanket legislation very difficult. These issues are better left between women and their physicians.   "
2,"People always forget about Doe v. Bolton, which was decided on the same day as Roe.  Doe allows   abortion   after viability in order to protect the health of the mother, with health being defined in a very broad fashion.Consequently, atrocities like late-term abortions and partial-birth abortions are permitted, despite the viability standard established in Roe."
2,"On abortion, the issue is when love, not life, begins Robert Casey, former Governor of Pennsylvania - ""When we look to the unborn child, the real issue is not when life begins, but when love begins.""[16] The point is, since we should be capable of loving a fetus (a human being in the making), we should subsequently provide that being with rights and protections. It matters not what we call the unborn child (a ""baby"", ""human"", ""life""); as long as we love it, we should protect it. And, an attitude and life-style of love and acceptance is superior to an attitude and life-style of fear and regret.
"
2,"a description of Partial Birth Abortion from Ask.Com:Specific steps in the most commonly used partial-birth   abortion   procedure, Dilation and Extraction, are: 1. A medical professional induces a breech (feet first) delivery with forceps. 2. Legs, arms and torso of the fetus are delivered (i.e. expelled from the mother). 3. The back of the fetus' skull is punctured with a scissors-like instrument. 4. A suction device is inserted into the skull. 5. The device sunctions out the contents of the fetus' skull, causing the skull to collapse. 6. The lifeless fetus is delivered. Although, as you point out, late-term abortions are not common, they are cited by   pro-life   advocates because of their horrifying nature.  Similarly,   pro-choice   advocates constantly refer to the need to protect the right to an abortion in cases of rape or incest, even though those circumstances account for less than 1% of the abortions.There are not many   doctors   who will perform late-term abortions because it is clear to any reasonable person that you are killing a baby.  There is also a real dispute about what constitutes a threat to the life of the mother sufficient to justify such a terrible act.One of Dr. Tiller's patients recently wrote about the abortion she had at 22-weeks because she developed pre-eclempsia.  Readers then commented that pre-eclempsia can be dealt with by bed rest, so a question arose as to whether the woman had bad medical advice or whether her situation was very unusual.With regard to a threat to the   health   of the fetus, I have never understood that as being a justification for a late-term abortion.  Why not give the child a fighting chance at life, instead of killing him or her in the womb? Another one of Tiller's patients wrote on Andrew Sullivan's blog that she had the late-term abortion because a heart defect had been discovered in her son.  One of the comments on the post was from a pediatric cardiologist, who stated it was outrageous to abort a child due to a heart defect because those infants have excellent chances for survival.  If the mother saw that comment I am sure she will haunted by it for the rest of her life. "

2,"""the body is no longer able to continue essential functions independently."" We can't apply this definition because some of these essential functions cannot be continued because they are still in development. You can't say ""no longer able to"" if it hasn't even started yet.Simple logic.A Zygote from the moment of conception is in a constant developpement that goes beyond the moment he's out of the womb. And no dependency can justify the killing of a human being. The greater good always is life, there are no greater good than the life of a human being.Furthermore if what you said was true then the life of a human beings depends solely on the artificial technology that is able to make him survive out of the womb.

2,"At the moment, there is a lot of debate in the scientific community as to what constitutes life? We have no problem identifying animals and humans as being alive, but what about when it comes to things like virii, bacteria, a planet, a solar system, the collective internet?If we can accept that single celled organisms are alive, in that they have active micro-organisms working collectively to prevent atrophy and cell decay, then we could say that an egg cell or a sperm cell is 'alive'. However, do such single celled organisms hold the same 'status' or value as the life of a fully formed human? Obviously not, otherwise just about every male would be convicted as a mass murderer. Thus, the question becomes, when does the life of the single celled organisms become ""human life""?This is a more interesting question. Is an organism defined as human according to physiology? If so, then is a person missing a limb less human than one with all four limbs? Well, that is absurd. Thus, the question of classification as human is not dependant on physiology. I would like to argue that it is thus dependant on DNA. So, at which point does an organism hold complete human DNA. It is at the point where the chromosomes from the sperm cell and the egg cell combine. It is at that stage, that human life begins.It is thus a logical conclusion that a fetus, from time of conception, should be considered a human, with equal value placed on it's life."
1,Life has been around since the first organisms on this planet have been here but it continues.  Your mother and father were alive when their living sperm and egg met and made your living embryo.  No one cries for the lives of the other billion sperm.  However meaningful life begins when people give it value.  If we were to give all life value at conception smoking by or in the presence of any woman of childbearing age should be attempted murder because it has the ability to end the life of a new embryo.  Without omnipotence however we don't know how many 'lives' have ended before we ever knew they existed.With all of that I believe MEANINGFUL LIFE does not begin until much after conception.

One the other hand, almost no one believes that a full-term baby is NOT a human being.  The ""line"" is somewhere in between conception and birth.  Where there is a doubt, I think it is smart to err on the side of the mother.  Where there is no doubt, then there is no problem.  ""Abortion"" as an issue is a smoke-screen designed to divide and conquer people who would otherwise agree on enough to make them a danger to the power of the state.

1,"You're right that there is very little difference between a full-term fetus and a newborn infant.  However, if you understood my argument as claiming anything other than this, then you misread what I wrote.  The distinction I am making is between a full-term infant (or even a pre-term infant with sufficient gestational development to survive outside the womb) vs. a fetus of insufficient gestation to allow it to survive through the independent functioning of its own bodily systems - in other words, a fetus which has not yet reached a point where it is viable outside of the uterus (with whatever medical interventions are available).  This is why I would draw the line at somewhere around 20 weeks gestation, but would prefer to see abortions, if they must be performed, take place within the first few weeks after conception.  The further the pregnancy progresses, the murkier the line becomes.  And when the point is reached where the fetus, if delivered, would have even a small chance of survival outside the uterus, I believe the line is drawn and crossed.  Any   abortion   after that point should be ONLY done if the fetus is clearly physically non-viable, such as an anencephalic fetus.  If a pregnancy must be terminated to save the life or health of the mother after the point of viability outside the uterus, and the fetus is normal and healthy, then I believe a vaginal or cesarean delivery should take place and every effort made to save the life of the pre-term infant.  Of course, this is what generally happens in such cases, anyway.  Very few mothers facing a health crisis late in pregnancy and needing to bring their pregnancy to a close would desire to lose the baby in addition.  Arguments which imply this are really quite bizarre.  "

2,"It is amazing to see how the advances in embryology since the mid-70s have required   pro-choice   Catholics to rely upon doctrines like quickening and ensouling in order to justify their position.  Instead of addressing the question of when life begins, they choose to address a religious question -- ""When does someone receive a soul?""  Not surprisingly, they conclude that there is not a consensus answer.  Uncertainty is bliss.However, the issue of when human life begins is a scientific one.  At the moment of conception, a distinct human life is created.  An individual member of our species, with his or her own DNA, has come into existence.  That life may be cut short before birth because of miscarriage or abortion, but the life is a human one.  It is not going to be a puppy.  It is not going to be a pony.  It is going to be a baby.Evading the fact that life begins at conception may let people like Mr. O'Brien sleep better at night, but it is intellectually dishonest.  I actually have more respect for people like the feminist writer Camille Paglia, who is honest enough to admit that abortion takes a human life, but feels that countervailing interests mandate that we allow the practice to exist. "
1,"It is incorrect to say that the issue has been resolved by science. What is the molecular change that is so important? The unique genetic events happen earlier, when the gametes form. Conception is a necessary event, but it is only one of many along the way. Because our biomedical sciences are in the era of the gene, we have become focussed on the importance of genes in every process. We confer a false sense of importance to a unique set of genetic material.Identical twins are illustrative. Their separate lives certainly don't begin at conception."
2,"At the moment of conception a new member of the species has been created.  Genes are important because they are the code for what that person will become.  The fact that identical twins become two lives instead of one does not change that.  The issue here is whether   abortion   destroys a life, and it clearly does."
1,"It is simply your opinion that a new member of the species is created at conception. The issue is not that cut and dry. Genes are important, but they only do part of the job of creating a person. There is nothing inherently special about a new combination of genes, that is not what makes us who we are. Yes, a fetus is alive, and   abortion   is the end of that life. If you think war is sometimes justified then I don't see how this is ""the issue here."" I would never argue that abortion is a good thing. It is sometimes the lesser of two evils."
2,"So are you saying that you agree life begins at conception but that   abortion   can still be justified, or something else?"
2,"At the moment of conception a new member of our species is created.  If nothing happens to him or her, in nine months they will be what anyone would consider a person.It is my opinion that it is not acceptable to destroy the unborn during those nine months simply because they have not been born yet.  The person each of us becomes is certainly molded by more than just our genes.  However, an unborn child who is aborted never gets a chance to become anything.I see no comparison between   abortion   and war.  Soldiers are combatants and sometimes they kill each other.  In an abortion an innocent life is intentionally destroyed.  The corresponding action in a war would be the intentional killing of an innocent civilian, which is considered a war crime.  "
1,"You simply restate your opinion that a new member of the species is created at conception. I disagree. These are opinions.I see a good analogy between an   abortion   to save a woman's life, and a nuclear bomb to save a way of life. The scale of the tragedy is very different, as is the scale of counterbalanced benefit. These are lesser-of-two-evils decisions. We do intentionally kill innocent civilians, even now in Afghanistan. We regret the necessity of the larger war. We feel sorry for the innocent lives lost. We fervently hope that none of the casualties, this time, are completely innocent. We know they will die, but we launch the weapon anyway. Rules of war just require that we try to limit the deaths of innocents.Nobody is killing an innocent fetus out of hatred for the fetus. We are talking about compassion for the woman, who is undoubtedly a fully realized human being and may also be innocent."
2,"How often do you think an   abortion   must be performed or else the mother will die?  I would bet that is not even 1% of the total.Most abortions are performed because: (1) the baby would interfere with school or career plans; (2) the mother is pressured into it by a husband, boyfriend or other relatives; or (3) the mother believes the baby will cause economic hardship.For all of the agonizing that goes on in making the decision, in the end it basically comes down to, ""Baby, you are a major inconvenience, you have got to go.""In showing compassion for the mother, not enough emphasis is placed on the psychological trauma caused to the mother by abortion, which the mother is not aware of until it is too late.  That trauma is only now starting to be more widely publicized.  Perhaps you read last year about the artist in England who was pressured by her boyfriend into aborting her twins and then went home and killed herself.  Her suicide note was heartbreaking."
1,"That a fetus is a living specimen of the human species is non debatable.  It is as close to proven as science is able to get.  (I qualify that statement because science can't even prove we're all here)We do not intentionally kill innocent civilians in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Sometimes it happens, whether because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time, there is a mistake, or the enemy intentionally uses them as human shields, but never intentionally.  Sometimes it would be beneficial to intentionally kill innocent civilians (read Lone Survivor) but we do not, as a matter of policy.  Sometimes, individuals do, but they are swiftly and harshly dealt with.  if you don't believe the media or whatever for whatever reason, you can trust me.  While I haven't been over there, (yet) I have friends who have.  They all tell the same story.  Your slander of the U.S. military is repulsive and is misleading in the debate.  Rules of war require that intentional killing of innocents be met with court martials, dishonorable discharges, and severe sentences at the least and war crimes charges at the most.  You're right, nobody is killing an innocent fetus out of hatred for the fetus, but that almost makes it more disturbing.  Except for in cases in which the woman's life is in danger, they are being killed for convenience, like a dog than nobody wants anymore, except that they require dogs be put down gently.  Fetuses often writhe in pain as they are doused in chemicals, or struggle to escape the hose as they are ripped limb from limb by a vacuum."
1,Abortions can happen naturally or be induced. What is the moral difference?
1,"It is better to regret not having a child than regret having one It is clear that abortion is a choice between evils. Therefore, the question is not whether a woman will regret having an abortion; she will. The reason abortion is justified is that a woman will sometimes regret having a child more than she will regret having an abortion. Abortion is sometimes justified as the better choice between evils.
"
2,Intent.  A person can naturally have a heart attack and die.  A person can also die from a heart attack induced by someone spiking their drink with an overdose of amphetamines.  The two events are not morally equivalent. 
1,"At conception, a living, unique member of the human species has been formed.  There is no debate here.  Any scientist will tell you that a fetus is both alive and human.  (as opposed to, say dog)  Sperm and eggs are also technically alive, and human.(assuming they came from a human)  The difference is in the DNA.  A fetus has the same DNA it will have for the rest of its life.  It is a new and individual member of the species.  Whether it is a person and thus entitled to rights is up for debate.  However, a fetus is definitely alive, and definitely a member of the human species."
2,"The sperm is a part of the father's body.  The unfertilized egg is a part of the mother's body.  When they are combined, they create a new life, with its own DNA pattern and individual existence.  The new life is reliant on the mother's body, but it is a separate life."
2,The sperm and egg have DNA patterns from the parents.  It is the combination of the DNA patterns that creates a new person.  Sperm by itself does not become a new life.  An egg by itself does not become a new life.  You combine the two and you have a new life.  A new person will come into the world in nine months as long as nothing happens to the unborn child during that period.
2,"Neither an egg, nor sperm cell contains a full 46 chromosomes which gnetically comprise a human being.  Sort of like a hair follicle; the genes aren't all activated, so it's only part of a human being; same with somatic cells; they only have part of a particular human's DNA.However, when 2 sets of chromosomes combine, and are fully active (as is the case at conception) you have, not a part of a human, but an entire human, for the cell is the fundamental unit of life, biologically."
2,"Rapes account for less than 1% of the abortions each year, so in over 99% of the abortions you are not dealing with those horrendous circumstances.Why does only the mother have bodily autonomy?  Is it because she is bigger than the fetus?  Is it because we can see her, but can only see the fetus on a sonogram?  Is it because she can speak for herself and the fetus cannot?The entire concept that the mother should have complete control over the fate of her unborn child has always struck me as illogical.  If the woman wants the baby, she will protect the baby with her life and will try to do everything in her power to make sure the child is born healthy.If the mother then decides she not want the baby, for any reason or no reason at all, suddenly he or she is considered a parasite that can be destroyed.The fetus has not changed in any way.  It is still the same unborn life.  Should anyone have the authority to arbitrarily destroy another life? "
2,"I am sorry your friend had to deal with such a terrible situation.  Even if Roe v. Wade was overturned, I do not think any states would pass a   law   that precluded   abortion   in the case of rape.  There seems to be a strong majority in favor of that exception remaining.Some women have decided to have the baby after a rape.  I remember reading awhile back about a mother who was trying to figure out how to explain to her daughter that the daughter was the result of a rape.  I think she decided in the end to tell the daughter that the best thing in her life came out of the worst day of her life."
2,"First, I find it interesting that you intentionally choose the loaded term ""anti-choice"" as opposed to pro life to describe your opponents.  Of course the other side does the same with pro-  abortion   but that doesn't make it a sound practice.  Your argument should stand on its merits, not on emptionally loaded terms.Second, your argument that personhood is what matters is, in my view, a subterfuge.  What I can't fathom is why, when you cannot say when that is, any more than others can answer when life begins, you have no problem with proceed with abortion without an answer.  Whether the issue is life or personhood, the same problem remains.  If you can't determine when personhood occurs, you always run the risk of killing a person through abortion.In the end all you've really done is move the problem somewhere else.  You haven't solved anything."
1,"Just because you can't nail down the exact time of personhood doesn't mean to can't say it's ""sometime after this point"" or ""sometime before that point"". I won't speak for the earlier poster, but I would argue that it's sometime after the brain begins to develop, and sometime around or before self-awareness. That is not to say there is no value in an entity during other time-frames, but that the value is not that of a ""person""."
2,Ask yourself this question. When does 1 + 1 = 2?Now or three months from Now?
2," Human life and a right to life begin at conception; abortion is murder Human life is continuum of growth that starts at conception, not at birth. The DNA that makes a person who they are is first mixed at conception upon the male sperm entering the female egg. This is when the genetic building blocks of a person are ""conceived"" and built upon. The person, therefore, begins at conception. Killing the fetus, thus, destroys a growing person and can be considered murder.

1," Many women are disturbed by their abortions but remain pro-choice Rosemary Candelario, director of Massachusetts Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, September 2001 - ""I think the fear in the [abortion rights] movement is if we admit abortion is hard for some women, then we're admitting that it's wrong, which is totally not the case. I've heard from women who are having problems dealing with their abortion who are still ardently pro-choice.""[17]

1,"I say life happens three months prior to intercourse, conception is utterly meaningless to me.  It is also meaningless to you, you just don't realize it. If one believes physicality is what determines agency, then, one must also believe that the very concept, of conception, is meaningless.  Thus the two beliefs are at odds.  If however you believe intentionality is substance, then, I give you any such arbitrary boundary as you please, but I cannot give them to the whole of society."
1,"I agree that personhood is the issue far more than ""when does life begin.""  My personal sense is that ""personhood"" comes at the point when a fetus would be capable of survival outside the uterus, albeit with whatever medical interventions were necessary.  Thus, the onset of ""personhood"" will fluctuate based upon existing technologies for sustain the life of the fetus outside the uterus.  Currently the limit would be somewhere between 21-23 weeks.  I suspect that this will change over the next few decades, allowing fetuses at lesser and lesser weeks of gestation to be sustained outside the uterus.  Once a fetus is capable of being sustained outside the uterus, I would consider it to have independent life, and therefore, personhood, including the right to not be terminated.  If we reach a point where an embryo of a single day's gestation can be safely removed from the uterus and brought to term entirely in vitro, then I'd say that the days of justifiable   abortion   will be at an end.  Until then, it would seem to me that a declaration of personhood would have to take into consideration the rights of the mother whose body is carrying the pregnancy.  I do not believe that any pregnancy should be terminated once it has reached a point where the fetus would be viable outside the uterus, unless the mother's life or health is at serious risk and the fetus cannot be safely removed without further risk to the mother.  If a fetus is not viable, however, including for reasons such as anencephaly, then the continuation of the pregnancy should be at the mother's discretion."
2,"Hi,First of all after reading all the comments on this page we can agree that everybody aknowledge that the only answer to When does life begins (or more accurately as tbcass said When does the beginning of human development start) it's at conception.Now about personhood vs humanity.  To try and separate these terms has already been done several times in the past: in Nazi Germany the Jews were stripped of their personhood. In America, the native american and the african american were too stripped of their personhood. If you look in any dictionary the definition of personhood is: a human being. What you suggest here is that, based upon actual technology a human being has to be considered a ""person"" with all the rights that all other human beings have including the one fundamental right to life, a fetus get these rights when he's able to survive outside the womb.Let me ask you some questions:What about babies? Don't they also depend on his mother for sustaining (just as the fetus depends on the mother on this one thing). and what about old people who can't care of themselves?How did the fetus got into the mother's womb?, Was it the holy spirit or a consequence of her acts (ok, except raping)? We could say that the inconvenience is a direct consequence of her adult decision.Since when an inconvenience (of any kind, i can think of a lot worse than just being pregnant) can justify the ""right to not be terminated"" (killing) of a human being.Humanity does not depend on where (womb, house, car), how developped or how big (embryo, foetus, baby, toadler, adult), or how dependent we are, humanity starts when the genetic code of a man and a woman unite to form a new and unique kind of the homo sapiens sapiens specie.Any voluntarily interruption at any stage of the developpement of that human is by definition a homocide.Last thought about your :""If we reach a point where an embryo of a single day's gestation can be safely removed from the uterus and brought to term entirely in vitro, then I'd say that the days of justifiable   abortion   will be at an end"" This is even scarier that what i saw in Matrix."
1,"Babies and the (disabled) elderly are most certainly dependent, and rely upon the care of an adult in order to survive.  The difference, however, is that ANY competent adult can reasonbly meet their survival needs.  In the case of a fetus prior to somewhere between 21-23 weeks, it is not capable of survival outside the uterus in which it originally implanted (at least, not at this stage of our medical/technological development).  It is, in essence, a ""parasite"" (by strict medical definition) upon the mother's system.  It is reliant upon continued physical embedding within the mother's system to survive.  It is incapable of survival outside the uterus, EVEN IF another adult is willing to take on its feeding and care.  That is the difference between viability outside the uterus and non-viability outside the uterus.  For purposes of determining whose rights supercede whose, I believe that the mother's rights to her own body and to governing the processes of her own body supercede any rights of the fetus until such time as the fetus would be viable outside of the uterus.That said, if a mother is planning to terminate her pregnancy for reasons other than life or health, I believe this definitely should be done prior to viability outside the uterus AND should be done absolutely as early in the pregnancy as she is aware that she is pregnant, preferably within the first couple of weeks past her missed period.I would love to see technology developed which could take a fetus or embryo as far back as fertilization, and allow that fetus to be removed from the uterus at any time and to develop in vitro to full term.  If such technology were available, I would agree that there was no further use for   abortion   other than for fetuses incapable of survival outside the uterus for reasons of physical malformation, such as anencephaly.  I would also love to see a world which so focused on the PREVENTION of unwanted pregnancies, that abortion rates fell to zero because every pregnancy was a planned and wanted pregnancy.  But we won't get to that point with ""abstinence only"" education.  We will need to learn to be frank with our youth about BOTH abstinence AND other forms of contraception, and to make those contraceptives easier to obtain than chewing gum.   "

The resposability of it's existence is it's mother's that engaged in a sexual intercourse. This is a basic difference from a parasite. The mother is not just some adult willing to take care of the child. There is a unique and beautiful connection between these two beings and it makes the case against   abortion   even more painful for this.So the only two things that the fetus needs is: food (by aid of the umbilical cord) and space (the womb). Just as babies need food (mother's milk) and a place to stay (it's mother's home). The only difference is that the babies needs can be replaced by any willing adult while before week 21-23 the baby needs can be covered by one person only:  it's mother. Isn't it sad that the one person that with her acting brought him to life and the one person who as the duty to take care of him is the one person that wants to terminate his life?"
1,"Yeah, I know that the comparison tends to offend, but the fact is, there is very little difference between the two.  You claim that the difference is that women have sex by choice and become pregnant.  But people frequently acquire parasites through a voluntary act, too: Eating.  While certainly one can go far longer without sex than without eating, still both ARE voluntary actions which may result in a foreign living thing coming to attach itself to the inside of the host’s body and drawing its sustenance from the host without providing any particular symbiotic benefit to the host.  So, from a scientific perspective, there really is very little difference between the two.  Men (and sometimes women) tend to take very lightly the physical, psychological, and sometimes economic investment a woman makes during the 40 weeks of pregnancy.  Pregnancy is a body- and life-changing event which up until about ?-century ago, was the leading cause of mortality among women.  As it is, today, something like 4 in 1000 women will die, worldwide, as a result of pregnancy.  In developed nations, the lifetime risk of a woman dying as a result of one of her pregnancies is around 1 in 2800, but in places like sub-Saharan Africa, about 1 out of every 16 women will die as a result of one of her pregnancies over the course of her childbearing years.There are many women whose lives are at risk if they become pregnant.  There are some whose long-term health is at risk from pregnancy.  Some rely upon medications to control medical conditions, which medications may not be compatible with pregnancy.  Some women will lose their jobs if they become pregnant, particularly if they have bedrest.  Some women are caring for several infants and toddlers already, who rely on them, and cannot undergo the stress of another pregnancy, let alone care for their existing children during a difficult pregnancy.  Sometimes minors become pregnant before their bodies are strong and developed enough to support a pregnancy without risking severe damage.  Some women become pregnant as a result of rape, and have no choice in the matter at all.Just because a woman chooses (or is forced) to have sex does not mean that she is ipso facto giving consent to the complete takeover of her body by another being for the next 9 months of her life.  There are some very good reasons why women make the difficult choice to terminate a pregnancy.  I have made perfectly clear that I would be overjoyed if there were no further need for abortions in this world.  But there are some very valid reasons for a woman to have one.  And such decisions are best made by a woman and her doctor, rather than being forced upon her by society.  A rape victim, for instance, who is forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term is being raped yet again by society.  Her control of her body was taken from her by the rapist, and is again taken from her, at an even deeper and more violating level, by society’s compelling her to risk her very life and health to carry the pregnancy to term."
2,"You are right, from a scientific point of view a parasite is a living being that relies on a foreign body to sustain itself. ""While certainly one can go far longer without sex than without eating, still both ARE voluntary actions which may result in a foreign living thing coming to attach itself to the inside of the host’s body and drawing its sustenance from the host without providing any particular symbiotic benefit to the host""Objection:A foetus is not a foreign living thing, it's a blood-relative human. This is the point that the   pro-life   and myself think is the reason we consider abortion an injustice as bad as a genocide: every tiny little embryo or fetus is already a HUMAN being from the point it's continuous development starts: conception. There are no substancial changes in it's genetic code from that moment on. From the moment an egg is fertilized no external agent interfere with it to change it's composition. Any interruption of it's development to a new born baby is the termination of a human being. I think we all agree that all humans have the same rights.If you accept this hypotesis then let's look at your comment under this spotlight:""Men (and sometimes women) tend to take very lightly the physical, psychological, and sometimes economic investment a woman makes during the 40 weeks of pregnancy""> This is so very true, it is a huge change to the woman that becomes pregnant, i don't deny it.Now as you said it only lasts 40 weeks, a temporary condition. Abortion is permanent, it terminates the life of an innocent human being.""As it is, today, something like 4 in 1000 women will die, worldwide, as a result of pregnancy. In developed nations, the lifetime risk of a woman dying as a result of one of her pregnancies is around 1 in 2800, but in places like sub-Saharan Africa, about 1 out of every 16 women will die as a result of one of her pregnancies over the course of her childbearing years""> The number of induced abortions declined worldwide between 1995 and 2003, from nearly 46 million to approximately 42 million. About one in five pregnancies worldwide end in abortion.(The Alan Guttmacher Institute)Your stats: 0.4 % CHANCES to die during chilbirth (0.28 in developed nations).My stats: 20% CERTAIN death of a human being.What is worse?As for all the reasons you consider can justify an abortion:Are any of these, except a life danger situation for the mother, enough to justify the suppression of a human life? ""There are many women whose lives are at risk if they become pregnant"">This is not true, these are your stats: 0.4% chances of death during childbirth""Some women will lose their jobs if they become pregnant, particularly if they have bedrest"">This is sadly true, but shouldn't we ask our politicians to protect the pregnant woman instead of just send them to abortion clinics? This is a point i see we both agree as you said in an earlier post: there is certainly more to do to avoid unwanted pregnancies, and aid women to carry on their pregnancy.""Some women are caring for several infants and toddlers already, who rely on them, and cannot undergo the stress of another pregnancy""> Is it justified, in such a case to suppress one of it's children to make life easier for her? That would be infanticide, no matter the excuse. Why is it possible to kill the one she carries inside? Because we don't see it, it is acceptable to kill it?""Sometimes minors become pregnant before their bodies are strong and developed enough to support a pregnancy without risking severe damage""> Here again we should work on making these pregnancies an exception. No severe damage is worse than death.On the rape issue: The statistics tell us that less than 1% of abortions is done because of a rape.This is a very emotive issue that pro-abortion advocates love to expose.This is nonetheless a tragic outcome of a rape, to get pregnant of the man that violated you.But how suppressing a human life makes it easier? Isn't it killing even worse than the act of raping?How aborting will help overcome what happened to her? She will have to carry the child for 9 months and then give it into adoption. ""...there are some very valid reasons for a woman to have one. And such decisions are best made by a woman and her doctor, rather than being forced upon her by society""> A lot of people i talked to upon the subject see it exactly as you: If we ban abortion it is like a personal moral issue that society forces on women. We are not against women, it's just that we really think that all humans are equals in rights, and first of all those rights is the right to life. Only in a situation where the life of the mother is in danger we can accept that an indirect abortion can be the outcome. No reason can be put forth to justify murder except self defense. We just want this for every human being, no matter it's size, stage of development or dependency. These are differences in degree not in kind. Mankind."
1,"You have a very cold view of the rights of a rape victim.  As to your other views, I do not believe that a fetus should have the rights of a fully-developed human being until it's systems are able to function independently outside the uterus (not get it's own bottle and change it's own diaper, but simply breathe oxygen, process food and eliminate waste independently, without reliance on its mother's body to do these things FOR it.  As long as it is fully reliant upon her body to carry out these processes and incapable of doing so on its own, it is functionally a PART of her body, and her rights supercede its rights.According to YOUR model, the rights of the fetus TAKE PRECEDENCE over the rights of the mother.  According to your model, the woman who becomes pregnant CEASES to have human rights until a baby is delivered or the pregnancy spontaneously aborts.  Why should the fetus have MORE rights than the fully-developed independent human being in whose body it resides?  This is a situation in which the rights of one being will HAVE to supercede the rights of another.  Whether the rights of the fetus supercede those of the mother, or the rights of the mother supercede those of the fetus is the question, at its heart.  Therefore, since only one of the two is capable of surviving independently of the other, the reasonable choice would seem to be that the individual capable of independent survival has the right to do so.  Since the fetus cannot survive without taking over the body of the mother and without forcing her to forego her rights to function as she chooses and to medically control her own body, the fetus has fewer rights than the mother."
2,"Biologically, a new distinct human organism is created at conception.  Jon is right that the issue is not when life begins, because we know that.  It is when that life has value.  The value of a new human life is where we disagree.  Whether this new life deserves protection under the law.  Whether or not is has a ""  soul  .""  So if there is not a consensus about value, and probably never will be, why is that those that want to be able to dispose of embryos and fetuses ""on demand"" automatically win?  Why is the burden of proof on those that think all life has value?  If someone wants to take what is biologically a human organism and end its existence, is it not on them to prove that life DOES NOT for certain have value?  If we cannot know for certain should we not always err on the side of life, not death?I am reminded of an analogy from my philosophy professor in   college  .  You are   hunting   in the woods with your friends.  You hear a rustle in the bushes.  It could be a deer.  It could be one of your friends.  Do you shot?  In other words, when uncertain you err on the side of life. Always."

2,This is a scientific question. The Question should be better put this way: When does the life of a distinct human being begins? There is no debate here:   science   tell us that the life of each and everyone of us begins at conception when two haploid cells unite and fuse to create a new diploid cell called zygote that through constant and driven development will terminate it's existance with death.Personhood (that shouldn't be confused with ensoulment) is a philosophic question and is not the subject of the debate.Best link:   http://www.l4l.org/library/mythfact.html  
2,"""The question is not whether life is present."" Yes it is, look at the top of the page. An embryo is alive, not dead. Now what that means to   abortion   is another question. "
1,"I disagree with the binary assumption: human or not human. Something that has the potential to be human is not the same as something that is human, but it is certainly not worthless. I feel that it is dangerous to deal in absolutes.Is a brain dead person on life support a human? I'd say yes. Now in a fire, who should be rescued first, the unconscious nurse or the vegetable? Harsh!Is a convicted criminal a human? I'd say yes. But we strip that person of their inalienable rights.Is a soldier in an enemy army a human? How about an 'enemy combatant'? ...The truth is that we assign, as a society, the rights we deem appropriate to the circumstances. We constantly balance one person's rights against another's. We do not have a black and white system where every human gets the same treatment. It is a crime to sterilize someone against their will. That is assault on the potential parent, not the potential children. Somewhere along the way the potential child starts to get rights independent of the potential parent. In some unfortunate cases, those rights are in opposition. I do not believe that we should ascribe equal rights to the fertilized egg and the unconscious nurse. If only one can be saved it should be the potential mother.The humanity (humanness?) of a fetus grows with time. It is not a light switch nor a flip of a coin. "
2,"Whether or not something is human is easily determined by examining its genetic code.  Human blood can be proved to be human, and canine blood to be non-human scientifically.  Whether or not something counts as a life is also a settled manner in science for most things- including fetuses (but not for some relatively odd things like viruses and prions). If it is not merely a constituent part, but  complete, and if it has the appropriate life functions, then it is a life.  (This rules out cases such as human tissue which has been made to continue to survive apart from the person it came from.)There is no question but that a new human life comes into being at conception.  Any scientist will have to admit that, and the US court system has even reviewed and verified that this is scientifically verifiable.The real position of people like O'Brien (who know better, but still say that 'it isn't clear when life begins' , because that is more marketable) is that in spite of the fact that a new human life exists at conception, they don't think that all human lives deserve rights- even the right to avoid being destroyed.  'Personhood' is a quality which supposedly is present in most humans after birth but which is never present at certain points when the life is still in utero.  Since personhood can arguably mean whatever you want it to mean, if it is necessary in order for human life to receive rights, then they can justify   abortion  .  'Personhood' is not a scientific term.  'Human' and 'life' are scientifically definable.Human lives begin at conception- this is an established fact.When human lives get ""personhood"" is unknown. "
1,"I used 'humanity' rather than 'personhood.'  I am not talking about having human DNA, which along with life, is present before conception as well as after. In the science that you are invoking, there is no such thing as new life - life is a continuum, as is the DNA that encodes it.  Human DNA by itself defines a cell as Homo sapiens, but does not make a cell a person. That is why we are trying to develop a term to describe what IS new, a new person. There is no single point in time, no switch that occurs where a developing human goes from having none of the characteristics of a person to having all of the characteristics of a person. That is the binary thinking that I am arguing against.In the miraculous process of going from 2 adult humans to 3 adult humans there are many intricate biological steps that all must be taken at the right time and in the right order. At every stage, there is life, and that life has human DNA. Along that path, the potential adult human is granted incrementally increasing rights - from none while it is still a sperm and egg to full rights at 18 years (or 25 if you want to rent a car). Many humans never make it, or get sick and lose some of these rights, or make mistakes and have these rights revoked. It is our job (as a society) to assign rights to humans at different stages of their existence. Rights to citizens, rights to criminals, rights to the insane, rights to children, rights to pregnant women, and rights to the unborn. I shudder to compress such complexity into a binary box built of DNA."
2,"Using 'humanity' rather than 'personhood' clouds the issue, because many people will not realize that being a living human being is not the same as being a person.  When a new human life exists- ie, when there is a new organism which is alive and which is a member of our species- is incontrovertibly established by science as being at conception.  Because 'personhood'  is a subjective distinction, it could be binary or shades of grey or whatever is in the eye of the beholder.  It is a philosophical category, and not empirically verifiable.  Unfortunately, many in the public at large may hear 'humanity' and think the subject is science rather than ideology.The idea that there is no such thing as new life is an oft repeated   pro-choice   trope.  Obviously there has been life on earth since before humanity existed, and there has been a continuity of human life since the species first evolved.  That is missing the point.  Life 'in toto' isn't what is meant when the question ""When does life begin"", is asked.  New and unique lives are what is being referred to.  Otherwise, we would ask, ""When did life begin"", or ""When was there first life on earth?""  A new and unique, and complete human organism exists at conception.  That is when the life cycle begins.  That organism undergoes development and change continuously from that point until death- but the organism is complete at conception.  (I already addressed the issue of DNA indicating that a cell is a human cell without being a human beings in my previous comment.  It is just a constituent part of a human organism, but not one itself.)Again, when human life begins is clear: at conception. The only dispute regards the hazy issue of 'personhood'- which is a matter of opinion, not to mention a distinction that may not even be meaningful.  It is important to let the average person know that there is no scientific dispute, because that is the misperception that people are (intentionally?) being led to make."
1,"You make many definitive statements about what is true. These are your opinions, not incontrovertible truths, as you present them. This subject is debatable even if you say it isn't.I take particular exception to this statement, ""A new and unique, and complete human organism exists at conception.""At conception there is a single cell that, more likely than not, possess errors that will prevent it from becoming a complete organism. Even in the case where the fertilized egg has no defects it is not a complete human - the hardest, most miraculous parts of becoming a complete human organism are still to come. You appear to be equating the potential to be complete with actually being complete. I believe there is an important difference between an acorn and an oak tree.You are wrong when you say, ""When a new human life exists- ie, when there is a new organism which is alive and which is a member of our species- is incontrovertibly established by science as being at conception."" The phrase, ""incontrovertibly established by science,"" is far from true.Scientists as a group do not agree on this very debate. The question is, ""when is there something new?"" Many biologists that deal in whole organisms (e.g. organismal biologists, ecologists, etc.) use a definition that includes ""independent"" when counting the members of a species. Geneticists mark conception as the creation of a unique gene combination that is then subject to selective pressures. However, they will tell you that the same thing is true at the onset of a cancer. Many neuroscientists put the creation of something new significantly later, when neural or even cognitive activity begins. Immunologists tend to put importance on the start of the self-selection process when the developing embryo begins to distinguish (at a molecular, not cognitive, level) between self and non-self. It is not true that science has shown conception to be the most important beginning. There are many firsts in each cycle of life, each of them equally necessary for the continuity of life. Our modern popular obsession with the importance of DNA leads to the idea that conception is the most important benchmark. I don't think it is. Oh, and a trope can certainly be true."
2,"Tropes can be true, but a purely '  pro-choice   trope' is ideological. First, a brief point- then I'll address objections.  Every species has a life cycle.  The human life cycle begins at conception.  You are in a position wherein the beginning of the life cycle must of necessity be occurring to something other than a living human organism.  How can one make sense of that?  I posit that one cannot. Such a cell might not develop into an adult.  A lot of genetic anomalies prevent reaching adulthood. If one is present in an infant, that wouldn't be a basis for denying the infant is human, which brings us right back to where we started. First a question: You used the term 'miraculous'.  I won't make a silly objection about its being non-scientific. Would you permit me to use the term 'created' in a secular sense?  As in, "" at this point a new life is created.""Secondly, you contend that something isn't completely human until some point well after the organism's life cycle has begun.  How can you argue that a zygote or an embryo or a fetus (human or not) is not a living member of it's species?  If we were talking about gametes, then I'd agree. They require other cells to make a complete human. Are you using ""complete"" in another sense?  If you're using the term ""human"" as synonymous with ""person"", then you're not making a scientific observation.  Are you using it to mean ""mature"" or maybe ""independent""?  If so, you are employing an arbitrary distinction.  One could say that an organism isn't ""complete"" until it has reached the final stage of its life cycle.  Then a kitten isn't complete, but a cat capable of reproduction is.  By any objective standard, a kitten is considered a complete (albeit not fully mature) living feline. Frankly, I am confused by this.  Can you expand on it a bit?   Quite right!  I know of two cases where there are scientific disputes about when something qualifies as being alive.  The first (things like viruses and prions), I mentioned before.  The second is a seed.  A seed is an embryo which can go dormant.  That raises an interesting question: ""if it is dormant, then is it living?""  I'm not sure that there is an accepted answer.  Humans (as far as I know) don't become dormant.  I must admit that I've never heard of 'organismal biology'. I have trouble believing that any biologist would maintain that an embryo (non-dormant) isn't alive and isn't completely human or feline as the case may be. Sure, in the latter case you have a complete living cancer cell.  That's not incompatible with my position. POSSIBLY THE MOST IMPORTANT OBSERVATION:When do they ""put importance on""?  Which is ""the most important beginning""?  These are questions about value determinations.  They are questions about what to emphasize or give significance.  Now, there can be value determinations which are context specific, and therefore testable.  You've given excellent examples regarding branches of science.  ""Which of these three breakfast cereals is best?""  Is an untestable value judgment. ""Which of these three cars is best... at saving gas for driving on city streets?""  Is (likely) empirical.""When Does Life Begin?"" is not a matter of determining value. It is an objective question, although ambiguous. If we agree that the question might better be stated along the lines of ""At What Point Does A New Human Life First Exist?""- then it is a matter of fact.  It begins at conception, and that isn't a value judgment...or an opinion."

1," Risk-taking and disorders lead to abortions; not the opposite This argument is partly a response to studies that claim that there is a correlation between abortion and mental disorders. The point is that this might be true, but the causality of this correlation must be determined. It may be that those with existing mental disorders are more likely to take risks that lead to the need for abortion, and that this is the explanation for the correlation, rather than that abortion leads to mental disorders. 
"
2,"I think you make great sense!When I found out I was pregnant I immediately was excited. I didn't wait until my baby was ""big enough to deem viable"" I knew right then and there that life was growing inside of me. Most women will tell you the same thing. We all know a precious life is there regardless of his or her stage of development. People arguing to the contrary are attempting to justify murder with a lot of rhetoric (professing themselves wise they became fools). I also know many women who are spending the rest of their life grieving over the baby they aborted.  You will not be able to argue away their grief with ""When is life viabile"" rhetoric.In the words of John Donne: ""No man is an island...any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.."" Or how about Psalm 139:16 ..""your eyes saw my unformed body.  All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.""It's interesting to note that one of the first things Hitler did when he came to power was to legalize   abortion  .  By the time he was deposed they were killing 6 year olds who were still wetting the bed because they were deemed imperfect. Hitler knew that if you can devalue life at one level, you can learn to devalue at any level."
1,"My favorite line by Jon OBrien is ""hard cases make bad   law  ."" It is easy for people with limited experience to make harsh judgements on certain issues, especially if they are indoctrinated when they are young by religious beliefs.    ""Hard cases make bad laws."" ""People arguing to the contrary are attemtpting to justify   murder   with a lot of rhetoric (professing themselves wise they became fools."") Biblical quote, I assume.   In 1969, before   abortion   became   legal   in this country, the doctor who delivered me 11 years before treated me after I had been raped by a stranger in my own bed with my whole family asleep in the house. With tears in his eyes, he ensured that I would not have my rapist's baby at age 12. According to you, my doctor, my parents, and I are murderers. I believe this is what Jon O Brien or anyone else would refer to as a ""hard case."" The problem with blanket judgments such as yours, and what makes abortion unique, is that a choice often has to be made between the welfare of the mother and that of the fetus, in my case, a fertilized egg. For my parents and my doctor, the choice was obvious, but not to many callous religious zealots. Forcing a child to have her rapist's child is tantamount to raping her again, yet the Catholic   church   has intervened in such cases against the child. It is sad to say that the last 15 years have shown us that the Catholic Church has turned a blind eye and even enabled horrific child abuse on a large scale, permanently damaging their credibility on any such issue to the core.These situations get very messy ethically and medically, and are best left between women and their physicians. Envision yourself at the door of an ER watching a scenario similar to the one descibed above. Most rational people would turn and run, not walk away from such a situation, with an overwhelming feeling that they had violated that family's privacy with only a glimpse and undrstanding of what was taking place. The thought of actually intervening is unfathomable when it has actual human faces. It is much easier when there are not.  Because of the numerous factors to be considered, abortion lends itself to limited legislation at best. Abortion restrictions do indeed ""make bad law.""    "
2,"I am very sorry for what happened to you.  You are wrong in assuming that because I know that   abortion   kills a child that I must not care about the mother.  I do care about the mother and I care about you.  I have personal friends who have had an abortion and I love them.  I also love that precious life that was inside of you.  You don't know if carrying your child to term would be raping you again because you never did carry your baby to term. You don't know that you are better off aborting your baby because you can never know what life would have been like with him or her.  You are also assuming that because I base my beliefs on Christian principles that I must be wrong.  Are you absolutely sure there is no God?  That He doesn't love and care for us at every level?  That He doesn't care for your child who is now with Him?  Can you substantiate any claim you make or imply that abortion is justifiable?  What happened to you was horrific but how did having an abortion make it better? That baby didn't commit a   crime   against you but he/she received the   death penalty   for it.  Rape is wrong but so is   murder  .  What moral stand are you taking?  Rape is wrong because it was done to me but murder is not wrong because I committed it?   I don't know you and you probably don't think I understand you but I am going to be praying for you everyday. You may not believe it, but God loves you because He made you and He is watching over you and can bring healing into your life."
1," I am always just blown away that prolife people would even consider suggesting that a traumatized child rape victim should have her rapist's baby.   YES. YES. YES. I was better off ""aborting"" that fertilized egg (two cells with a complete set of chromosomes does not constitute a ""life"" in my opinion, but potential life) and limiting the entire incident to that.It was NOT   murder  ,it was absolutely justified, and your suggestions to the contrary are just abusive. I refuse to buy into it. MY WELFARE as a traumatized young girl with a fully formed brain, body, and  consciousness should have and did take precedence over a fertilized egg. That should be a No Brainer to any rational person. No loving God would ask such a thing.  Are you even considering the   health   risks to a child delivering a baby? Did you research that at all before suggesting it?   The problem is people do not have a clue how a child's mind works, just how traumatic this is. Since you cannot understand, I will tell you that my Catholic faith,with its obsession with virginity, caused me to believe that I was ruined, dirty, defiled,that God sent this man to do this to me because I had been bad. Why else would he allow such a thing? There is no other explanation to a child, and religious teachings serve to reinforce it. That's the kind of thing that misogynistic religious dogma does to a child rape victim. The combination is absolutely lethal to a sexually abused child's spirit and self esteem. Rape of a child is spiritual murder. Needless to say, I am no longer Catholic. And although i can tell you mean well, I feel sorry for you because you have swallowed that dogma hook, line, and sinker.  "
2," First of all, I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what happened to you.  Furthermore I am sorry that you had to receive further trauma at the hands of those who claimed to be representing Christ and His   church   yet, by your account, treated you in an unChristlike, unscriptural manner.  You did nothing to deserve what happened to you and any Christian leader who has made you feel that way are one day  going to be held accountable to God.  It's understandable that you have a lot of anger against the Church as well as people like me who are Christian (I'm not Catholic, by the way).  Therefore, I am not going to get into an arguement with you about when life begins.  I am going to tell you that there is a God and according to scripture He knew you and loved you before He even created the universe. He loves you so much He sent His son to earth to die a cruel death on a cross so one day you can spend eternity with Him. Where, as it says in the last book of the Bible ""He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain...""(Revelation 21:4). This  gives me great hope.  An end is coming to all evil.  If it is not true, what have we to look forward to?  More people committing crimes, more suffering until finally we destroy each other?   God cares about you and has healing and blessings to give you if you would only turn to Him.  As I said, it doesn't matter to me what you might think about me but I am not going to stop praying for you."

The law cannot ignore morality, and just because many voters derive their morality from religion- that does not mean that they shouldn't weigh in on the issues.

1,"Most in the ""Conservative"" community will favor banning   abortion  , yet call for the end of the welfare state.  ....As if the child has any sort of say in the crappy lifestyle choices of the parents.  As if the life that is so valuable inside the womb has suddenly become none of their concern.   I've always found that a bit odd.    The very idea that a ""Christian"" can be in favor of putting anyone to death is absurd.  The whole view of Christianity is to turn the other cheek.  It is denying that ""an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"" is valid.  "
1,"Liberals do not, to the extent that Conservatives do.......mind you these labels do not truly describe the majority of either party as labels are the exaggerations of the extremes.....anyway, they do not use the church as a platform for election in the same manner.

What don't you understand about how it is contradictory to be against   abortion   AND, at the same time, be against welfare?   If the church was doing such a good job.. as, if the private or faith based sector were doing such a good job at providing help to the poor... there would be no need for the welfare state to exist.  Further more, if - as is claimed - more than 3/4's of the population is Christian, why is there resistance to welfare?  To say that life is precious and must be protected against the ill-choices of the parent.  If we say we must protect the voiceless... why does it not seem contradictory to you to protect the voiceless lives of children against the ill choices of their parents? Or as is more likely, considering the evidence, the ill choices of the parenT?    This bloated inefficiency you speak to comes not from the fact that welfare is not intended to actually help the poor.  It is meant to keep the poor as exactly that - poor.  But that aside, you speak as if Conservatives have not controlled congress.  You make it sound as if ""Conservatives"" as this bastion of gleaming solidarity in beliefs... and are not corrupt.  If they are part of the government - they are corrupt. But you're ignoring the point...  If Conservatives run their campaigns with an eye toward the Christian base, they should be more proactive in welfare.... since life is so precious as to choose it over liberty.  "
2," Abortion often leads to regret, depression, and even mental illness Carol Everett - “The product, abortion, is skillfully marketed and sold to the woman at the crisis time in her life. She buys the product, finds it defective and wants to return it for a refund.

To work toward the creation of a more perfect union! YES!    That's why it's probably best if you discard these nonsensical labels of Conservative and Liberal.  Most people don't even know what those mean anymore, they've become so distorted.  Ever notice the hostility you automatically transpose onto so-called ""Liberals""?   People hate this name ""SocialistBetty""...  make completely irrelevant comments about it.   ...which is why I chose it. Because I'm evil like that.  But more to expose how people really feel about things without having to dig very much.  I share more of the true values of conservatism (old-school) than I do socialism.  Although socialism has nice aspects to it, it's like saying that Kant, as a philosopher, was completely right about everything. Um... no.   But to combine those things that do work with what Does work in capitalism... to find the ""Golden Mean"" and untie the Gordian knot...   it may not be possible, but our love of labels certainly isn't helping.Isn't that what we're supposed to be striving for? A more perfect union of our states?  Not getting hung up on naming ourselves as one thing and one thing only?"
1,"Do you ever wonder where that first heart beat comes from? It just... POP... occurs.  What makes it do that?   It's kind of wondering why the big bang banged.  If you believe that the Big Bang even banged at all.  Or like wondering where ""God"" comes from, if your of that sort.  No one really knows yet....  I think that's interesting.  Apparently, it's inherent to these certain cells, but the exact cause as to why the heart begins to beat is unknown.  Except from   http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1999-09/937254975.An  .r.html (okay, so it's practically all of it...!)""The electric stimulus that triggers the muscular portion of the heart, known as the myocardium, to contract is myogenic. This means that the contractions arise spontaneously within the myocardium itself, and propagate from cell to cell. Input from the central nervous system can modify the heart rate (the frequency of heart beats), but it does not initiate beats.The ability of cardiac myocytes (the cells that comprise the myocardium) to beat is an intrinsic property of these cells. In fact, myocytes removed from the early heart and grown in culture will beat sporadically, and if they become connected to each other, will then begin to beat rhythmically, in unison. As a functional organ, the heart begins to beat very early, even before it has assumed its final form. Interestingly, the heart begins to beat even before structures such as valves and septa (singular: septum; the muscular walls that divide the chambers) have formed! The initial contractions are peristaltic--that is, they proceed in a wave-like fashion along the length of the heart. Later, once the heart has matured and the conduction system has developed, the contractions proceed in an orderly, timed sequence through the different chambers.Because beating is an intrinsic property of the cardiac myocytes, exactly what causes the heart to begin contracting is essentially a cell biological question. Unfortunately, there is not yet a definite answer to this question. We are beginning to understand how cardiac myocytes are specified very early in development, long before the heart has even formed. And we are learning more about their differentiation--that is, how these cells, ***which initially are not any different from cells*** that will give rise to the stomach or to muscles in the arm, develop the characteristics that allow them to contribute to the beating heart. From research in these areas, it is clear that certain things are required in order for the heart to beat. For instance, cardiac myocytes must have contractile proteins, such as actin and myosin, that are properly assembled into a scaffold (known as a sarcom ere) that allows contraction to take place. In addition, these cells must have specialized structures called gap junctions, which allow them to communicate so they can beat together in a synchronized fashion. Thus, while it is clear that certain elements must be in place for the heart to beat, it is not yet clear what stimuli are responsible for initiating contraction.""FASCINATING!"

2,"One more thing: As shown by all the different opinions tehre are in the   pro-choice   side about when does personhood begins -wich is a contraddiction in itself: personhood cannot begin because it is something that appears and develop througout time- there is a certainty that some of these concepts of personhood are wrong because this would mean that we cannot abide to a universal concept of man wich is the base of all our laws and is written in the UDHR. This means that as long as we accept   abortion   there is a certainty that we are killing at least some humans persons that because of someone's personal belief was not considered such. I cannot accept that we can't turn personal belief into law, but we can allow all kinds of contradictory personal beliefs to surely kill some innocent human persons."
2,"When life begins is a scientific fact, so an opinion poll really doesn't help that much.  Inalienable rights means they can't be taken away, and as we all know that is not from the   bible   or from personal belief, but from our civil   society  's founding document.  By the logic of Jon Obrien slavery, prostitution, women's rights, civil rights, etc. should not have been addressed by civil   law   either.  "
2,Where does   law   come from then? Deeply held beliefs that the majority hold become customary practices; customary practices become law... Where else can law come from?
2,"Deciding when someone has a soul is a religious question.  Deciding when someone is a person for purposes of the law is a legal question thanks to Roe and its progeny.Deciding when human life begins is a scientific question that is capable of determination.  At conception a new human life has been created.  How much protection that life is entitled to then becomes the question, which should be a political one. "
2,"Alcoholism and drug-use are common after abortions. There are many reports of woman falling into not only depression, but spates of alcoholism and drug-use after having abortions.
"
1,"While I disagree about the primacy of conception in the process, I do agree that a fetus (and the egg before conception) is alive and human, in the sense that its species is undeniably homo sapiens. As you say, the question really is how much protection is a fetus entitled to. I believe it is never zero and increases throughout gestation. The changing balance between protection of the expectant woman and the fetus is a political one, worthy of legislation and judicial interpretation."
2,"The problem with the Roe and Doe cases in 1973 is that the Supreme Court's ""solution"" to the   abortion   issue was to impose the basically unrestricted right to abortion that existed in New York at the time on the entire country.  The degree of protection afforted to the unborn should be decided by the people of each state, having reasonable discussions like this one, not five justices sitting in Washington D.C. "
1,"I am broadly in favor of contentious issues being decided in smaller jurisdictions, rather than nationally. How would you feel about a national requirement that states not be able to enact bans that   cross a less-contentious, federally-defined limit e.g. rape/incest/serious harm to the mother? This could include some kind of counseling requirement and/or late-term ban as well - negotiated, in other words.My concern is a practical one. After 30 years of bitter fighting, I don't think we would get reasonable discussions like this one. The ideological institutions are geared up and ready, on both sides. If we make a change, I'd like to have some kind of damper to prevent a draconian, reactionary swing."
2,"As I matter of principle, I would not want federal involvement because I do not think it is constitutional.However, as a matter of political reality, you would not have states passing laws that prohibited   abortion   in cases of rape and incest.  Exceptions for those circumstances are supported by an overwhelming majority of the public.  In any event, those account for only about 1% of the abortions each year.The health of the mother exception might be more contentious because of the issue of how you define a threat to health.  I think the fact that both sides would be geared up and ready if the issue was returned to the states would actually prevent the reactionary, draconian swing you are concerned about.  Neither side would have an advantage beyond the fact that some states clearly trend towards one position or the other.   "
1,"Since we have arrived at a peaceful place, perhaps you can help me with something. Why are exceptions made for rape? I understand why I feel it is justified, but when I read the arguments of people here I don't understand the exception from the 'anti-  abortion  ' perspective. If I may attempt to restate the position: the fetus is an innocent human being that should be protected. How is that changed by the circumstances of rape? It's not the fetus's fault. Isn't the rape exception an instance of including the emotional health of the mother in the decision?"
2,"It is for legal purposes, not moral purposes.  The unborn child is always considered an innocent life, and the hope would be that the mother would recognize that (there was recent story in Slate about a woman who was looking for a way to explain to her 10-year old daughter that she was the result of a rape, so it does happen).A rougher version of this approach is presented by Liam Neeson in the movie ""Rob Roy"", where Jessica Lange, playing his wife, tells him that she is pregnant and the baby is probably that of a British officer who raped her.  She asks if he wants her to abort the baby and he replies, ""It is not the baby that need killing.""In the absence of the mother's decision to accept the new life, even most Catholics, like myself, would not pursue passage of a law that required the mother to have the baby. "
1,"Because we're not really all working from the same definition of ""life"". I mean, my finger constitutes life because it's got cellular activity. There are bacteria in my stomach that constitute living beings. What, exactly, are we trying to preserve?"
2,The embryology textbooks used to train   doctors   (I think the most widely used one is written by a doctor named Dixon) are clear that at conception a new member of the species has been created.  He or she has DNA distinct from the mother and the father.  A new life has been created as a matter of   science  .  The degree of protection that life deserves is what cannot be determined by science.  
1,"Is somewhat questionable--Whether we can apply what's in an embryology textbook to be scientific fact--probably not.Yes, there is A textbook called ""The developing human: Clinically-Oriented Embryology"" that states ""a zygote is the beginning of a new human being (i.e., an embryo)."" This does not answer the question of ""what is a human being"" or ""at which point should a cell philosophically, politically, theologically be considered a human being."" It's an example of one scientist saying what they think."
2,"Since embryology is the scientific study of the development of human life prior to birth, I cannot think of a better scientific source for determining when human life begins.The second part of your comment gets to the heart of the matter, although I think it should be phrased differently.  At conception a new human being has been created.  It is not going to develop into a puppy, or a pony.  It will become, if that development is not terminated, a human baby.What you are really raising is the issue of when should an unborn child be considered a person, in the   legal   sense, who is entitled to   society  's protection.I think it is extremely important to separate the two concepts for the purposes of debating this issue.  Abortion destroys a human life, whether it is performed at four weeks or twenty-four weeks.  That is a scientific fact.Denying the humanity of an unborn child may make people feel better about the 1.2 million abortions performed every year in the US, but it is intellectually dishonest.The question that must be squarely faced is whether a mother should have an absolute power of life or death over her unborn child.  You may believe the mother should have that authority, but denying that a human life is being extinguished is nothing more than an attempt to evade the enormity of what has been done.  "
2," Fewer women would have abortions if they knew what they were doing Bernard Nathanson, former abortion doctor turned pro-life, in his book Aborting America, 1979 - ""Fewer women would have abortions if wombs had windows.""[19] After the abortion, women are confronted with a much more profound sense of the reality of what they have done and what they have lost. This often triggers depression.
"
1,"Textbooks change over time. It changes as we know things. It changes as we learn things are different. If I found you an embryology textbook that said the opposite, that said that a fetus cannot truly be considered human until week whatever, would you be forced to admit that ""Scientifically, human life begins at this stage.""?MEDICALLY, an authority we could possibly go to was the AMA. The AMA says there's no consensus between   doctors  .There are spectrums of opinions ranging from At Birth, to At Conception. There's no majority. There's just..a line in a textbook.Scientifically though, it's less clear. For example, we could go to the neurologists. Neurologists are the people in charge of the study of the nervous system, and it's through them that we get the idea of what constitutes dead--ie, Brain Death. Using that rule, we couldn't really start Life until--Brain life. The first neurons start firing at around 5 months, and the brain is fully developed at 7.So there's a valid scientific alternative. "
2,"Of course they change over time, as medical knowledge increases.  Good luck finding a modern book on embryology that states that a human life is not created at conception.With regard to your point on brain activity, a brain that is dead is still a human brain.  A brain that is developing in an unborn child is still a human brain that is developing.I find the whole ""brain wave argument"" to be another evasion.  Is it really okay to destroy a human life simply because it does not have what you regard as sufficient brain activity?  The brain is developing.One thing is certain, if the unborn child is aborted, he or she will never have a chance to have any type of brain activity.   "
1,What evidence do you have for this?
2,"Hiding behind the various religious beliefs regarding the beginning of life just evades the question.As a scientific fact, at conception a new human life is created.  Are we going to permit that life to be destroyed?  If so, will there be a certain point where we will no longer allow it to be destroyed?The answers to these questions determine what type of a society we will be. Unfortunately, the United States Supreme Court took the issue away from society and decided an unborn human being can be terminated at any point prior to birth.  A great deal of the divisiveness in the   abortion   issue stems from the fact that the answers to those questions were mandated by the Court, not resolved through the political process.  "
2,"Even if the Religious Coalition's interpretations are correct, I think it is safe to say that embryology has advanced significantly since the various books of the Bible were written."
2,"The only comment I will make is about the use of Exodus 21:22-25. Read the full three verses:If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.Notice the use of grammar here. If NO MISCHIEF follows the premature birth, the man is to pay a fine of whatever the husband wants. However, if there is any mischief that follows the premature birth, the person who caused it is to repay eye for eye, tooth for tooth, right down to life for life. God considers that MURDER before the child is born. In fact, eye for an eye is a legal punishment for any adult injuring any other adult willfully. So here God is giving the unborn child the same rights as any adult would have under the Law.Please, next time you try to use the Scriptures make sure you keep your use within the context of the passage. When God was giving Moses these instructions He used specific language and didn't include a penalty for hurting the mother in these verses, it all revolves around the unborn child."
1,"It's not causing a premature birth, it refers to an accidental miscarriage."
2,"An infant is not a ""choice maker"" either.  Does that mean an infant is not a person?"
2,"You quote Genesis and the creation of man, using the Hebrew word for ""breath"" to prove your point; however, you forget what the truely important part here was: Adam did NOT take the breath, God did it FOR Adam. Therefore, Adam didn't cause himself to breath but God put that breath of life within Adam. Same goes for the babies: while they've never taken air in through their lung, though they do get oxygen (the main purpose of breathing) through their mother making that a flawed statement anyway, they still have the breath of life in them. That is God's to give not ours to take."
2,"""A person is a complex creature that has moved from genetic individuality (DNA) through functional, behavioral, physical and social dimensions.""Based upon the Religious Coalitions thinking, an infant has probably not moved through enough ""functional, behavioral, physical and social dimensions"" to be considered a person.What about a mentally challenged person?  Would he or she be considered ""complex"" enough to be regarded as a person?This argument by the Religious Coalition reveals the real danger that lurks in many pro-  abortion   arguments.  Many of the criteria that are used to deprive the unborn of protection can be applied to other members of the human race.  Starting down that road will lead us to some very dark places.    "
2," The lives of women have been destroyed by abortion, not enhanced Norma McCorvey, the anonymous litigant known as ""Jane Roe"" in the landmark abortion case, Roe vs. Wade in her book Won by Love (June 17, 2003) - ""One of my most important activities is that I am involved, together with Sandra Cano of Doe vs. Bolton, in the efforts of the Texas Justice Foundation (and other groups) to work for the reversal of the Roe vs. Wade and Doe vs. Bolton decisions. The approach we are taking is to show that the lives and rights of women have not been advanced or enhanced, but rather destroyed, by abortion-on-demand. We are collecting affidavits from women who have been harmed by abortion, from women who are convinced that authentic feminism is pro-life, and from professionals who know that Roe has weakened the moral fabric of the legal and medical professions.""[20]
"
1,We already do withdraw protections from other members of the human race. To be human does not confer very many rights on its own. We frequently kill other fully adult humans. We have for a long time without sliding down your slippery slope.
2,"It is a basic tenet of Natural Law that innocent human beings should not be intentionally killed.  The fundamental, and deadly, defect in this argument by the Religious Coalition is that if you start saying innocent life can be destroyed because it has not moved through enough ""functional, behavioral, physical and social dimensions"" to be considered a person, that standard can easily be applied to others beyond the unborn.Does an infant pass the test?  What about a mentally handicapped infant?  What about someone in a coma?  What about someone with Alzheimer's?  Once you start making these types of judgments, you can easily end up like the Nazis, executing 70,000 mentally handicapped people (including Pope Benedict XVI's cousin), who were regarded as ""useless mouths to feed.""  "
1,"I don't believe that it would be easy to end up like Nazis. For one thing, we have their cautionary example. I would also point out that we did intentionally kill innocent Germans and Japanese in our fight against fascism. We regretted it, but did it anyway. My point is that we already break this basic tenet of Natural Law - there is nothing absolute about it. So, 'innocent human beings should not be intentionally killed without a good reason' appears to be our practical standard.You state their position as, ""innocent life can be destroyed because it has not moved through enough 'functional, behavioral, physical and social dimensions' to be considered a person,"" but there is an additional important criteria once we go from ""when does a human begin?"" to ""is   abortion   legal?"" Their is now another person's well being at stake. Any rights we assign to the fetus will always need to be compared to those of the pregnant woman when we consider the implications of abortion."
2,"It is a mistake to base our morality on actions taken during a war that could have ended civilization as we know it.  Things were done that might not have been done in less dire circumstances.  Unless a mother is actually going to die unless an   abortion   is performed, I do not see how wartime morality applies to an abortion in a suburban clinic.I hope you are right about it being difficult to end up like the Nazis.  However, I think it is critical that we stamp out elements of their ideology whenever it raises its ugly head.With regard to the rights of the mother, unless she was actually going to lose her life, I do not see how her interests would outweigh the child's right to life.  In addition, the mother probably does not recognize the trauma the abortion will inflict on her until it is too late."
2,"How do you scientifically prove that life begins after conception? You make an assertion without substantiating it. Let's be honest. You believe in   evolution   therefore you believe might makes right.  The weaker deserve to be destroyed by the stronger.   There's nothing weaker than an unborn child. However, if God created the world and instilled a moral compass by which to steer, murder is wrong. If you don't believe in God then how do you suscribe to any law?  What makes murder of your neighbor wrong? Let's pass a bill that says if I can prove I'm more viable to society than my neighbor, he doesn't deserve to live and there's nothing wrong with me killing him. All our laws are based on moral axioms. If you take away one, there's no reason to follow any of them.  "
1,"Using some god as an arbiter of right and wrong is wildly dangerous unless you live in a completely homogeneous society. After all, many religions have a god, and they often have very different moral codes. To read up a bit on at least one variation on morals, check out Peter Singer (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer  #Applied_ethics). His philosophy is quite up my alley, and might at the very least offer you a different perspective on how morality can work.To put my perspective in a nutshell, ""life"", or ""personhood"", or whatever you want to call it, should be based on capacity for cognition. This does mean that there will be both levels of personhood as well as different types, as there are both levels of cognition and a wide array of cognitive abilities."
2," Actually it's amazing how moral codes regardless of belief systems are homogeneous.  No one wants to be lied to or cheated on or stolen from etc.    You're still basing your personal beliefs on the premise that there are no absolutes just different perspectives. I maintain that there is God who created all of us and instilled the truth in every single one of us. If you have differing views on how you should treat others (e.g. killing the unborn) you have a common viewpoint with the rest of mankind concerning how YOU want to be treated. (e.g. no one has the right to kill me.) Your last statement seems to imply an ""uberman"" philosophy: the smarter one is the greater right to life he has."
1,"How do you justify killing animals for food or clothing? We are sufficiently advanced in our technology and knowledge such that it is not necessary for survival. While I do indeed believe that one that has greater cognitive powers has greater inherent value, that does not mean one with lower cognitive powers should be sacrificed for the former's pleasure, only for the former's need. As such, I will eat meat under certain situations where I feel it is merited by need or a sufficient advantage to myself, but I am otherwise vegetarian.As to your view that God created all and instilled truth, how does that square with the vastly differing views on what that truth is? Any common morality can be explained using game theory. That is, either it is immoral to do to others what you wouldn't want done to you, or more broadly that which is wrong is so because of the negative impact on the society."

1,"Let's face it: life began millions of years ago, and has continued more-or-less uninterrupted since then. Individual organisms succeed one another within the continuity of life, building on the genetic inheritance from their parents, and at some point these organisms began studying biology and philosophy and invented   religion  .A sperm is a living entity, and therefore a life form, as is an egg, and as is any cell in our body. But we prefer to think of only entire complex organisms as living entities, and individual cells as just a part of a living thing. So when we ask the question ""when does life begin?"" we're not referring to the event millions of years ago. We are not referring to the beginning of life in general, but to the beginning of a particular living organism, or person. And it's tempting to answer that a person begins to exist when a sperm and egg unite, because this is when a unique genetic combination first takes shape. But there's a problem with that notion, because it's just a single cell at that point, not a complete organism. Is there really a ""person"" there? Or just a human body cell? That rudimentary cell has no brain, no mind, no consciousness of its existence, can feel no pain or joy, and has no more claim to real personhood than any cell in my body. Except that it has the potential of developing into a person. So it's a potential person. But does that make it a person? Or just a potential future person? What is a person, anyway? Well, I know what a person is. I can distinguish a person from a dog or a hampster. I also recognize a newborn baby as a person, even though it doesn't yet speak a language I know. But a single, mindless, almost-microscopic spherical cell that has none of the attributes of a person? That's   stretching   things. I'd rather wait until it has a brain and a consciousness and an ability to feel pain and pleasure and know that it exists before I call it a person.Ah! But is it true that this single cell has no attributes of a real person? Some would argue that it has a soul, implanted by God himself, just like an adult human being! And that's what makes it different from a skin cell. That's what makes it a real human being, not just a part of a human being. It has a soul!But does it? That's a religious belief, not supported by scientific evidence. And even our concept of a soul is difficult to distinguish from our concept of our mind, except that the soul is supposed to live forever, whereas the mind dies when the brain dies. But the soul is supposed to retain all the memories of the mind, we're told, and to succeed the mind as our own identity after our body dies. Is all that true? Or could the soul really be just the mind, but with the added attribute of eternal life? Do we even know that there is eternal life? The Bible says so, but it was written by people who thought the earth was flat and the center of the universe. Oh, I forgot. God wrote the Bible by manipulating the hands of the authors. So everything in the Bible is absolute truth. Or is it? OK, let's come back to the real issue. Should we send a woman to prison because she interrupted the development of a single parasitic cell in her body that might otherwise have become a person someday? Or was it already a person? I think that depends upon whether it had a soul. If it didn't, it was just another mindless cell that might have developed into a human being some day, as might any developing egg or any sperm. And the issue of a soul is purely a religious issue. If we rely upon the unsubstantiated religious beliefs of certain people to imprison women who take command of the   health   of their own bodies by refusing to submit to the growth of an unwelcome, mindless parasitic cell and a following eighteen-year sentence of parenthood, then what kind of   society   have we become? The objection to the   abortion   of a mindless cell is based upon the purely religious speculation that that cell has a soul implanted by a god. But even if you believe in a god and a soul, how do you know when that god sticks the soul into the body? That's pure speculation. We don't send people to prison for violating speculative religious beliefs, especially if they don't personally believe them. This is a   democracy  , for God's sake, not a cruel theocratic totalitarian regime like Iran. If you don't like a democracy, go to Iran. You'll be better off, and so will we."
1,"The claim that this is the only ""logical answer"" is positively absurd. If it's logical at the stage of a fertilized egg, why not at the sperm and ovum production? But those events can't happen without their host bodies first being born, so maybe it should be the grandparents' conception of the earliest parent. But then you run into the same issue and it regresses infinitely.Conception is certainly a choice and a point in time, but to claim that it is the only logical answer is utter inanity. Just as a fertilized egg is a component of a human finally being born, so are millions of other factors, many including the internal environment, incubation and nourishment of a fetus inside of a woman. To say that a fertilized egg *is* life would to be say that an engine *is* a vehicle. It simply isn't sufficient to produce a human.As long as we're talking about logic, we may as well examine actual logical constructs. A fertilized egg at the point of conception is a *necessary* condition for human life, but not a *sufficient* condition. As any logician knows, a consequence cannot come about without *all* necessary conditions (and at least one of them or an additional one being sufficient). Under this model, life could be defined as the point at which all necessary conditions (and at least one sufficient condition) have been fulfilled. Logically, that probably puts the event at the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the mother.Obviously that's not the only possibility for when ""life"" begins because the question is terribly broad—after all, sperm are most certainly alive. This is also not the best criteria for drawing a line for   abortion  , but it's indisputably more logical than the original author's weak and baseless claim.There are more pertinent questions to be asked in the abortion debate beyond this one, such as ""When does a fetus achieve independent brain function?"". On those topics there can certainly be fruitful and interesting debate, but this question is too broad and this ""expert"" is tragically naïve."
2,"You haven't given any reason to rule out conception as being sufficient, and you have allowed that it is necessary.  Miner's point was not that it was logically necessary that conception be considered the starting point- rather that it is 'logical' to err on the side of caution when potentially taking human life.  This is a non-technical use of 'logical', and he might have been better off to say 'rational'.  If you get past that point, then he is certainly right that if you wish to choose the most 'cautious' interpretation, then it would mean that you'd have to pick conception.  (Your suggestion of haploid gametes is just silly.)"
1,"Of course conception is a necessary condition for a new human life—to argue otherwise or even bring it into doubt would simply be a waste of time. That is, assuming we have the same definition of conception.With equal certainty, conception is not a sufficient condition for new life—at least, if you define life as independent life. Without a mother to incubate a zygote into a fetus and eventually an infant, there is no independent new life. Simply remove the mother from the equation after conception to deduce that result.As for those who think that the zygote is already a new life, (not requiring that the life be independent, in other words), considering things like warts, moles and tumors each as new lives should lend to a different perspective. This isn't a completely absurd position to hold, but it is certainly eccentric and not one I feel compelled by.Then there are those who say that the zygote is a new life because it will eventually be an independent life. To me this seems no more convincing than arguing that a chunk of metal is a new car because it will eventually be used in the manufacturing of a car. There is a large emotional component to many peoples' positions on this issue that I am less affected by. When looking at the issue logically, I haven't seen a single convincing argument that the new life begins at conception."
2,"My original point was that on the nec/suf issue, you granted the former but made no positive argument for the latter, whereas the article was arguing that if the latter is not excluded it would be 'rational' not to err on the side of possibly taking a human life.If you just want to consider life as equivalent to independent life, then you're attempting to bypass the problem entirely by redefining 'life'.  People who are uncontroversially alive can be incapable of surviving independent of life support.  Unless people on respirators are ""un-alive"", that would eliminate independence as a necessary condition.Warts, moles, and tumors are not germane.  They are just body tissue which may not be functioning normally.  A zygotes is not a part of the woman's body.A chunk of metal, if left alone, will remain a chunk of metal (or deteriorate).  A zygote, if left alone, will begin the process of developing into a person.  The argument that because something is not in a state now entails that we should treat it no differently than something which is not particularly likely to enter that state is irrational.  If a boulder were rolling down a hillside toward my car and I regarded it is merely another rock on a hill, then I would be foolish.Logic can point out that an argument is invalid, but it can't speak to the merit of a definition.  Logic won't help the post-conception side any more than the pre-conception side.  "
1,"A zygote, if left totally alone, will die. However, if left to it's own devices as an implant in the mother's uterine lining, it may develop into a human being, it may not. A tumor, if left to its own devices on a person's body may develop into   cancer   and metastasize or may simply get larger and larger. The point is, there is no guarantee for any given outcome, only possibilities, given a set of probabilities and   conditions  . Zygotes are not like plant seeds where if you put them in the ground and give them a minimum of care, they'll sprout into fully living systems. If a mother gives her self no prenatal care she greatly reduces her chances of giving birth to a healthy or even live birth. Definitions in each argument must be clear and must have logical merit based on clear points and evidence. Therein logic can help one side or the other. A zygote cannot survive outside of the mother. It requires nutrients and other conditions (which at the present level of   technology  ) that only a mother can provide. The fact that a zygote is implanted in a mother's uterus and survives off of the mother's nutritional supply, is affected by the mother's internal milieu and homeostatic status, and does not possess a brain or consciousness and mind of its own makes it part of the mother, not a life unto its own, therefore subject to the mother's wishes for her body. At present, no technology on Earth can deliver a zygote of any placental mammalian species and keep it viable so that it develops into a live being. If the mother dies, there is a very, very small window (as in minutes) where   doctors   theoretically can find and prepare a suitable surrogate who can carry that zygote to term, but, outside those narrow conditions, without the host, be it the natural mother or surrogate, a zygote dies along with every other tissue in the mother. These conditions are the same for every other tissue in the mother's body. None of these tissues are considered to be separate lives. They can theoretically, given today's developing cloning technology generate new life. While the individual cells themselves may not be able to generate a new life, the genetic material inside, including that contained in cancer, wart or mole cells, contains a complete blueprint and theoretically only has to be transferred to a viable ovum to become a zygote and become a ""new life"". If the mother wishes to excise any of that tissue, there is no, ""separate life"" argument given. Yet, embryonic tissue that exists as a zygote/blastula/embryo/fetus that exists in the very same conditions, that would die outside of the mother or surrogate is governed under a separate set of rules and laws. My only ""  pro-life  "" argument would be that, in the human case, since the father provides genetic influence and will be subject to providing care, under   the law  , a father should have input in any decision regarding the zygote/embryo/fetus. However, since those decisions ultimately affect the mother, her   health   and body in general (not just the developing zygote/embryo/fetus) she and her   health care   provider should have ultimate say unless she designates otherwise... but all that was off topic and I apologize."
1,Well said and well written.  If other folks want it changed they need to change   the law   and leave everyone else alone.  Or they could move to Afghanistan and join some of the radicals there.
1,"Thank you for your kind words. However, I think the need to change   the law   is precisely the problem at hand. That is the reason why many individuals on either side of the debate, especially, those in any position to influence policy are making back flips and other acrobatics in reasoning and/or twisting logic. I feel the law should reflect facts, evidence and logic, and, reasoning based on those facts and evidence presented, tempered with the wishes and benefit of the public (notice I did not say the law should reflect the will of the public at large). I expect nothing better than ""gut feeling""   politics   and politics based on unfettered morality not tempered or influenced by reason and logic from the masses, who are easily influenced by demagogues and extremist ""gurus""... However, that our elected leaders have debased themselves and lowered themselves to this over the last couple of years (some would say decades) such that our republic is slowly headed towards the Shura system employed by Iran or Afghanistan, where the ""mullahs"" are running the the government, is disheartening."
1,"You were doing so well up until here. You are being wrenchingly absolute. The issue of aborting a pregnancy involves painful issues of moral uncertainty.I propose that there is a fundamental error in your 'beginning of life' argument. You take as given that there actually exists a definitive point at which a fetus becomes human (gets rights). You appear to be saying that   abortion   before this point is fine and afterwords in an enormous crime (murder). I think this is the wrong way to view the development of a baby. What if, instead, the moral 'crime' of abortion increases continuously throughout the process of development? What if it is wrong to abort any fetus, but at the very beginning of a pregnancy it is wrong to a degree similar to that of truancy or libel and sometime later it is wrong to the same degree as accidentally causing grievous bodily injury, and somewhere near the end an abortion is truly wrong to the degree of murder? I think this progression is much more in keeping with society's view of abortion. This allows for a compassionate comparison between the medical needs and rights of a pregnant woman and the gradually increasing realization of the human potential of a fetus.My conclusions.There is no magical point in development where a fetus transitions from worthless to human.A ball of cells can not have the same rights as a post-birth baby.No abortion is as morally inconsequential as having a mole removed."
1," Adoption is too risky making it a poor alternative to abortion Kristin Luker, Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood (1984) - ""Having a baby and giving it up for adoption, as pro-life people advocate, is not seen by most pro-choice people as a moral solution to the abortion problem. To transform a fetus into a baby and then send it out into a world where the parents can have no assurance that it will be well-loved and cared for is, for pro-choice people, the height of moral irresponsibility.""[21]

2,"""becomes human"" = ""gets rights""   (?!?)Let's try an analogy: Suppose I asked, when does life begin... for butterflies and moths?1>Female lays egg2>Fertilization of the egg3>Egg hatches4>Larva's first moulting5>Wing disks develop6>Chrysalis forms7>Adult emergesI can't see where it would make any sense to argue for step #1.  The cell is haploid and (I believe) cannot (without fertilization) grow or metabolize.  One could argue for #'s 3-7, I suppose, but to what end?  If you start talking about gradually becoming a lepidopteran (or 'fully lepidopteran' or a 'lepidopteran being') despite being lepidopteran life, then you just seem goofy.  You can argue that the ordinary referents to 'moth' and 'butterfly' are the adults, but that doesn't have anything to do with the fact that from a scientific point of view, the term should be applied not merely to the adults.Maybe you already disagree.  If you don't, then consider that (IMO) the only reason to advocate for #'s 3-7 as when life begins for a butterfly or moth is that there is a concern regarding value or emphasis being given to one portion of the life cycle.  For obvious reasons this happens when the question is put to ordinary people about human life.  Ordinary people are not trying to limit themselves to empirically based determinations.  Scientists (qua scientists) are required to do just that.  They have every right to assess value, as ordinary people, but not from the standpoint of ""doing science"".  Value and emphasis (and especially the attribution of rights) are normative and arguably subjective.  Science is supposed to be empirical and objective.This business about human life with the potential to be fully human or to be a human being seems from my POV to be strictly applicable to one species.  If that is so- then how is it justified as being something other than normative and non-scientific?"
2,"Mr Hammond: With holometabolic life (a word I definitely did not know an hour ago!), I think that your gradual approach would have even more justification- and yet it would still seem to me that it is merely continuously developing toward adulthood, not continuously developing toward becoming a full member of its species.  Absent the problem of a 'rights/no_rights' or 'worthless/important' dichotomy, would you not also grant that there is no basis for trying to distinguish (for any species, X) between being 'X life with the potential to be fully X' and just 'a live X'?"
1,"I have read your responses in various places. Thank you for being so thoughtful regarding this subject. If the question was precisely defined we might come to terms. They talk about the issue of   abortion   and then ask a nonsensical question, which needs to be interpreted in a context before it can be answered. My various posts, which you have responded to, have been themselves responses. The context has varied somewhat between philosophical, scientific, and legal.The theme to my thoughts is that I deny that there is a singularly important event in the life cycle of humans. We are Homo sapiens at every point and alive at every point. The parts of us that are new and unique appear at several different places in the cycle.In moral terms, I argue that it is morally wrong to purposefully destroy a fetus at any stage. However, I deny that a fetus is equal at every stage. The wrongness increases as we acquire the parts that make us unique, complex, and eventually sentient.If I was arguing for conception as THE start, I would begin with a nasty question: What is the first stage of human development called, and when does that stage begin? Many people will answer zygote and you will have them. However, the correct answer is gamete - beginning at meiosis. We have a brief haploid period in our life cycle, which occurs at the very beginning of human reproduction. Gametes are as independent from their parent as a fetus is, so there is still the question about whether they are really distinct or just a part of the parent. Random events in meiosis lead to a unique genetic make up for each gamete. Another random event (which egg and sperm join) leads to a zygote with a unique make up. Zygote is the first diploid stage. So, if the question at the top was, ""When does the first diploid stage of human life begin?"" the answer would be, at conception. Aside: Now I could be belligerent and mention that when a human begins to burn resources on reproductive structures that is really the beginning - the point where a human starts preparing the next generation. This illustrates the nature of a cycle, there is always something before.This discussion of beginnings simply does not help with the broader question of abortion. The ideologues on both sides of the abortion issue want an answer that leads to a legal result. They both want to create the binary situation that I argue against - the worthless/important dichotomy as you aptly describe it. In the absence of people trying to make this dichotomy you and I would never have had this discussion. The minor distinctions between being a sperm with the potential to be human and simply being a live human would be an esoteric subject."
2,"ONE:You wrote, ""I deny that there is a singularly important event in the life cycle of humans. We are Homo sapiens at every point and alive at every point. The parts of us that are new and unique appear at several different places in the cycle."" I wonder if it is within the purview of science to identify a ""singularly important"" event.  Wouldn't ascribing importance require the abandonment of science's claims to objectivity and detachment?  If we are homo sapiens at every point, then shouldn't science merely identify the earliest point as the beginning?  If a neurologist assigns importance to when neural activity begins, then that is appropriate given his field- for that is what is important _in_his_context_.  Life without neural activity is not particularly significant (except as it affects life that does) in his field.  Nonetheless, a scientific determination of when something begins shouldn't deal with what is important.  It should deal a beginning in terms of what is earliest.  Do you disagree?  Do scientists find it hard to come to a consensus about when life begins for fruit flies?  I think that you said that you were a biologist.  I'm sure that you said that you were a scientist.  If you say that there isn't a consensus on fruit flies, then I'd like to hear more. If they don't, then it seems that humans are probably treated differently as a result of importing philosophy (my chosen field) into science (yours)?  Fruit flies are hard to invest with much importance.  We talk about ""humanity"" being a quality in a way that is not equivalent to the quality of being ""a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens"".  There is no equivalent quality of ""fruitfly-ity"".Sexual reproduction seems to have a pretty clear starting point. Eukaryotes get kind of hazy- where does the parent cell leave off and the daughter cell start?"
1,"Assigning a beginning is trivial from a distance and gets harder the closer you look. In some ways it is even more complex with fruit flies than with humans, since nurse cells with maternal genetics govern the development of the early embryo for quite a while before the genetics of the embryo take over. There is no scientific need to define the beginning of something more broadly than for the experiment that you are conducting. When wildlife biologists count gazelles they choose a definition that works for them. When neurobiologists study neural development they wait until some point in development when a particular event happens. This question (when does life start?) is not a scientific one. I am a scientist, but I am not claiming to have authority regarding the issue, except where others make a false claim of scientific conclusion.With regards to the simple firsts, meiosis is the first event that gives rise to a unique genetic combination that will become part of a new person. Conception is another later event that can be described the same way. Conception is special, because pregnancy is special. All pregnancies have emotional importance to the people involved and should be viewed as having a moral 'worth.' That is why we should work to reduce abortions. This is an issue of law and society, not science."
2,"TWO""If I was arguing for conception as THE start, I would begin with a nasty question: What is the first stage of human development called, and when does that stage begin? Many people will answer zygote and you will have them.  However, the correct answer is gamete - beginning at meiosis.""Well, that is kind of funny to me in a way.  I'm   pro-life   but an atheist, and pro-life atheists get annoyed when they're arbitrarily lumped together with religious fundamentalists.  Someone asked me (around the time of the election when Palin caused talk of abortion to spike) how I could be an atheist and be opposed to contraception.  I said that that was a stupid question because ""I don't care what people do with their gametes"".  I told him that the government could put condom dispensers on every street corner and I'd mostly be concerned about it leading to more littering.Gametes aren't humans.  They are human cells, but I'm sure you'll agree that's saying a different thing.  A fertilized egg is a human cell too, of course, but with a difference: that single cell grows until it is indisputably a human being.  No gamete ever does.  That is why a human life begins (starts to grow into an adult human) immediately after conception.In the abortion debate, pro-choicers like to say that a fetus isn't a person, but merely a _potential_ person.  (Of course, they reserve the right to define ""person"" to themselves!)  Two gametes are a potential human if one is a sperm and the other is an egg.  If they're both sperm or both, then you don't have any potential humans.  You've just got human parts.  A chlorine atom isn't (table) salt, and neither is a sodium atom.  You need both, and you need them to bond before you have salt.  A sperm and an egg are analogous to the chlorine and the sodium.  Until you get both, you only have pieces.  Until the two fuse, you may have a full set of pieces, but that's _all_ you have.  When I was younger I took apart a calculator once.  I still had all of the parts, but I didn't have a calculator anymore    :)"
2,"Gametes may not even be alive.  I don't know if scientists use a significantly different approach, but in philosophy we occasionally discuss what is alive and what is inanimate, and I'm not sure that gametes qualify.  We talk about ""live sperm"" sometimes but electricians talk about wires being ""live"" too.  Sperm are motile for a period of time, but so is a lizard's tail.  It might be ""live"" in some sense of being active, but it isn't alive.A sperm cannot make another sperm.  (Can eggs ever make other eggs?  I don't know.  I know that they don't usually, but I don't know if some weird mutant eggs do occasionally.)  If a thing isn't the type of thing that can make another of its type, then it is not supposed to be considered a form of life.A sperm cell might be considered to have a form of metabolism- I'm not sure.  I know that sperm are affected by outside chemicals which can cause them to speed up.  I don't know how that works or what the process is called.  An egg doesn't have a metabolism (as far as I know).  Having a metabolism is a necessary condition for life. The cases that we found especially interesting when we discussed this topic were seeds and viruses.  Seeds' dormancy made it hard to decide if they stopped being alive for a time or not.  Frozen cells which can be revived have the same problem.  This can affect the debate over the ethics of embryonic stem cell research.  If their being frozen means that they are not alive (even if they can potentially be brought back to life), then can they be killed?Viruses are interesting too, because they don't grow, they lack a metabolism, and they can't reproduce themselves.  New viruses can only be made if they inject their DNA (or I guess RNA) into a living non-virus.  (Later I learned that prions raise the same issues.  I'd actually never heard of them until I was reading about BSE.)  Plasmids are something I learned about because of this discussion.  It seems to me that whatever category you put viruses, plasmids, and prions into is probably the category you should use for gametes."
2,"Aside: ""Now I could be belligerent and mention that when a human begins to burn resources on reproductive structures that is really the beginning - the point where a human starts preparing the next generation. This illustrates the nature of a cycle, there is always something before.""I'm a bit unclear about what that means.  Does 'burning resources' mean using energy?  What do you mean when you say 'reproductive structure'?  Are you talking about puberty or the development of genitals in utero?""This discussion of beginnings simply does not help with the broader question of   abortion  .""I agree to an extent.  The abortion question is about ascribing rights.  What sort of rights do women have over their reproduction?  How extensive can these rights be before we reach the point of absurdity?  (Unless you're [famous and controversial bioeticist] Peter Singer, you'd have to admit that it would be absurd to try to justify an elective abortion once ex utero viability has been attained.)  What sort of rights do humans have prior to birth?  How extensive can these rights be when they conflict with the wishes of the mother?The questions are philosophical, not scientific.  The reason that I think it is significant to establish that science does establish that human life begins at conception is that it shows people that the issue is not one that can be resolved through science.  If you accept that there is a human life involved other than that of the mother, then you accept that you are dealing with how to ascribe rights.  If you reject that there is another human life, then you can reject as absurd the notion that you would be giving rights to a such a thing- they compare it to giving rights to a tumor.  Some (but not all) pro-choicers use this strategy.  ""The ideologues on both sides of the abortion issue want an answer that leads to a legal result. They both want to create the binary situation that I argue against - the worthless/important dichotomy as you aptly describe it.""Hmmm.  Perhaps.  I'm not sure if I agree with that.  Most pro-choicers allow that a certain level of development entails restricting abortion.  Roe has different criteria for the trimesters.  The current law can be interpreted as taking a 'spectrum' approach rather than a binary approach.  The problem is that the law has to be reasonably simple, and so rather than a continuous gradual change, you end up with 'quantum leaps' from one trimester to the next.As a pro-lifer, I am willing to admit that I do have a worthless/important approach as regards gametes versus zygotes.  I don't think that that is philosophically problematic.  I believe that there is a dichotomy of human/non-human and that being pro-life is an outgrowth of that for me.  I do have a spectrum approach if you expand your parameters far enough.  Some non-humans (non-mammals) have (in my view) no rights.  Most mammals have a right to humane treatment.  Some mammals (great apes and some cetaceans) have rights even beyond that.  All humans have a right not to be injured or executed (especially without due process) but nothing more than that.  Only as you mature to you accrue additional rights. As far as value (as opposed to right attribution) is concerned, that would come up in 'life boat' dilemmas.  If only X people can survive and there are X + N people, then how do you decide who lives and who dies?  Relative worth of human life (in my view) is only appropriate to discuss in such situations, but they are rare.  That's also the reason that I have no problem with exceptions for the life of the mother.""In the absence of people trying to make this dichotomy you and I would never have had this discussion. The minor distinctions between being a sperm with the potential to be human and simply being a live human would be an esoteric subject.""I like esoteric subjects.  I'd probably have been interested in this topic anyway No one is battling over the status of viruses, and I've had discussions about that just for fun.My tastes aren't typical.  :)"
1,"Many interesting thoughts. Do you mean really an atheist, or pretty sure. Absolutely certain atheism seems like another religious belief to me.The definition of what is alive is fun. I threw my hands up a while ago and have just decided that anything that has both the potential to use environmental energy to combat entropy and has evolved counts as alive. I throw out the consideration of the potential for future reproduction. If it evolved to get where it is, then that is good enough for me. Viruses encode proteins that combat entropy. So do some plasmids. Prions do not*. Lizard tails and sperm are both definitely alive - until they run out of ATP and die.*Prions are always tough. There are some yeast prions where the normal (non-prion) state of the protein is an enzyme that would qualify as alive. As far as I know, the prion form always loses this quality."
1,"Brad Miner's argument on the one hand approach the issue from a legal/question of   abortion   point of view to avoid scientific or philosophical arguments, but then goes to the scientific/philosophical arguments to avoid legal issues. Essentially, his argument is that we don't know, so for legality's sake we should say it's at conception, except this ignores other legal issues such as a woman's rights. He needs to either deal completely with the legal issues, or actually tackle the philosophical issues. He's trying to have it both ways."
1,"Adoption does not spare a women the pains/risks of childbirth. One of the main reasons that an abortion makes sense is that it spares women of the pains and risks of child-birth. Adoption does not spare women of these pains and risks, and so fails to address a central rationale underlying abortion.  
"
1,"We can all agree that a fertilized egg is alive. But so also is an unfertilized egg or a sperm. They're not dead, and they're not inanimate objects like a stone. Almost every cell in my body is alive. Life began eons ago, and continues uninterrupted from one generation to the next. So we're not talking about the beginning of life, but the beginning of a particular living individual.Genetically, we could say that a new individual begins when a new combination of genes emerges. This happens whenever an egg or a sperm is formed, and it happens again when an egg combines with a sperm. The latter combination usually lasts longer than the former, but does that make it the only beginning of an individual?And when a fertilized egg divides into two identical twins with no change in genetic profile, are they both still the same individual as was the original cell? If not -- if identical twins are different individuals, then unique genetics must not be the definition of a unique individual. So what is the significance of the fertilization of an egg? Maybe a fertilzed egg is just a potential human being, or dog, or whatever, in the same way that a sperm or unfertilized egg is. Maybe it's the development of a functioning, thinking brain with a unique mind that constitutes the beginning of an individual. That seems to make sense.The religious, of course, substitute the word ""soul"" for ""mind,"" and they speculate blindly about when the soul is assigned to the body, having absolutely no information on the subject. Interestingly, as well, I believe they tend to conceive of the soul as much more mature than the rudimentary single-cell body it supposedly inhabits, capable from the beginning of self-awareness and thought and probably a love of God. That's why killing a brainless single cell is repulsive to them. It really is just a religious issue."
1,"Using Christianity as the answer, let's look at the Bible:Genesis 2:7: ""And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.""Genesis 6:17: ""And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.""Genesis 7:22: ""All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.""Job 33:4:""The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.""Psalm 33:6: ""By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.""Psalm 150:6: ""Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD.""Genesis 25:8: ""Then Abraham breathed his last and died . . .""These are only a few examples of this symbolism.Against all this, the proponents of conception as the divider will trot out Jeremiah 1:5: ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.""The biblical concept is human being becomes alive when the soul enters the body upon birth and the taking of the first breath.  This Christian belief was the basis for the English common   law   of inheritance, for example, noted by the SCOTUS in Roe v. Wade.Biblical references to death refer to ""breathing his last.""  Now   add   the symbolic essence of the Sacrament of Baptism. Not the pouring of   water   version symbolizing cleansing the soul of Original Sin, but the original (and still common) form by immersion.Immersion of the individual in water symbolizes a return to the womb, and when brought back up, there isa rebirth in Christ Jesus, symbolized by the taking of a new ""first breath.""Christian teaching in the 13th Century approved of   abortion   until ""quickening"" or a more formalistic (and different) number of weeks of gestation for male and female fetuses.  This can be found in papal writings as well as in St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologiae.Current Catholic teaching sets conception as the start. It's clear to me that such a standard should only be imposed on those who believe in such a faith formulation in opposition to the Bible-based truth spanning the human life from first breath to last breath.Creating a   legal   standard based on beginning human life at conception would be to define the end of human life as the termination of the process of decay.  we could expect:a. funeral rites where there is a spontaneous abortion or even an unusually heavy flow after being late with their mensesb. changes in the laws of descent and distributionc. a de-emphasis on ""birthday"" celebrations and a new emphasis on celebrating approximate ""conception day"" anniversaries(with my four   children  , I know an exact date my daughter was conceived, or at least the exact time of the romantic interlude - actual conception could have been a day or even two later.  With the other three, all I can do is count back a couple of weeks or so from ""missing."")d. a reformulation of the sacrament of baptism to perhaps eliminate immersion in favor of the ""cleansing the soul"" motif engendered by pouring watere. all sorts of issues in automobile negligence and other tort lawsuits.It's one thing to respect the process of construction - and quite another to call the structure a house from the time the plans are drawn by the architect and the building permit is issued.  Of course, people don't tend to build houses by accident, while   pregnancy   is often enough an unintended consequence.Human life in the abstract is a continuum - the egg that provided half my genetic blueprint was formed in my   mother  's mother's womb some time in 1927 or 1928, while the sperm that contained the other half was generated some time in the week or two before my conception in the early 1950's. And there was a point in those early 1950's when the eggs that would ultimately ""become"" my four children were formed, while the sperm that prvided the other half of their   nuclear   genetic inheritance were formed in the span from 1980 to the very early 1990's.In one regard, human life is a continuum without a real ending or beginning, and in another, the span of the life of a human being is between first and last breath.I believe in respecting life, even that of pre-born   babies   who are not yet legally human beings.  But I cannot in good conscience impose my own belief on someone else who does not believe the same way."
2,"I agree, when sperm and egg come together there is nothing else needed to determine whether it will grow to be a human or not. The DNA is set for that person forever. The only thing left is growth. Just as a baby from one month to one year living in his natural environment will grow, so does a baby from conception to nine months grow in his natural environment, the womb.Question: Why is it considered a double murder in our law when a woman pregnant with child is killed?"
1,"""when sperm and egg come together there is nothing else needed to determine whether it will grow to be a human or not""Are you sure you're not forgetting something? I think you'll find that the result of mixing those two in a dish will result in a smelly mess, and not a human.And if you're taking the presence of a uterus and functioning placenta, blood supply protective host immune system and the rest for granted, then why bother with niceties like mixing the sperm and ovum? Why not say that the mere presence of sperm and ovum is enough for the die to be cast?"
1,"This is going to be a deeply deranged argument, because the terms in which it is couched are badly flawed.What do you mean: 'life'?On purely biochemical grounds, sperm and ovae are 'alive'. So the embryo will obviously be 'alive' as well. But to extrapolate from this to the conclusion that an embryo represents 'human life' and thus should be afforded full human rights is ludicrous weaselling and sophistry.What distinguishes my appendix from an embryo? They have the same chromosomes - does my appendix deserve 'rights'? Should I be allowed to have it surgically removed?Some will object that an embryo has potential to become a human. But so does a sperm or ovum - to which we accord no rights of humanity whatsoever - given circumstances that are only slightly more complex.And so, in fact, does a cell from my appendix, if certain procedures are followed and the nucleus is extracted and inserted into an oocyte. If potential is the yardstick, any living human tissue has it, and I can see no sensible line of argument for special treatment of fertilised ovae that would not also apply to other tissue, or to gametes.Happily, apart from some religious ideologues and dogmatists, few people try to maintain such nonsense. Most tend to adopt an uneasy acceptance that somewhere along the process of gestation, a lump of tissue acquires sufficient similarity to a true human to acquire the rights that a human has. Unfortunately, this feeling is heavily influenced by the instinctive protective drive that all animals have for their young, and biased by it.Interestingly, the Old Testament has a much more pragmatic approach, in which children are not considered people for practical purposes until they have reached the age of around one month."
2,"You're argument rests on a false interpretation of the idea of potential. The definition of potential is, ""all the necessities of y are contained innately within x  and x will become y without prevention by an outside source.""For example, a seed in the ground has the potential to become a plant and will become a plant unless it is uprooted, eaten by animals, refused water, etc.A single random cell cannot replicate itself into a human, it needs a tremendous amount of human intervention.  A sperm will also not become a human, but must be combined with an egg first and be within the uterus to be classified as a potentially human. Additionally, your appendix is a part of your person-hood, as it contains your DNA.  A fetus is a different entity with distinct DNA and will be a distinct person.You have the right to kill your own person-hood, including any bodily organ that is of your own DNA.  Now, if it were actually cloned, it would become a separate entity because your mind is not split between two entities, but that is an entirely different argument. "
1,"Actually, you're not allowed to make up definitions of words to suit your argument or your prejudice. Words like 'life' or 'potential' already have meanings, and your redefinitions don't help the matter. My use of the word 'potential' was employing the definition given by a dictionary, to whit:""The range of capabilities that someone or something has; powers or resources not yet developed or made use of.""But, since your argument is tied so heavily into your personal definitions, let's see where they lead us:o According to your definition, my appendix cell would not qualify for human rights because it would take 'tremendous amounts of human intervention' to make it into a developing embryo.o In that case, I presume that you would not accord human rights to an embryo (or a child?) produced via artificial insemination, in vitro fertilisation or single sperm injection. Is that right? These require 'tremendous amounts of human intervention', and some techniques have only become possible in the last few years. Presumably you'd have no objection to even late-term   abortion   of a fetus resulting from these techniques.o And, according to another definitions of yours, 'a sperm will also not become a human'. No? What if I took sperm cells - perhaps from two different men - extracted the chromosomes from each, combined them, injected the full complement into a denucleated ovum and caused it to start dividing? That's not a human baby either, according to you - so I can do pretty much whatever I like to it, right? I bet it'll taste like chicken.You don't have to struggle with the underlying morality thrown up by these entirely plausible - if a little premature - scenarios. If you really believe that a sperm+ovum is a human being, I doubt you have the 'capacity'. That's another word like 'potential'. Make of it what you will."
2,"Our definitions are essentially the same, you just misapply the definition.""The range of capabilities that someone or something has; powers or resources not yet developed or made use of.""  While, like most dictionary definitions, this is vague and not completely accurate in a philosophical sense, it is still mostly correct.  My definition is essentially the same as well, but taken from Aristotle's definition of potentiality, ""Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if it is not prevented by something else.""Common definitions are a slippery idea. For example, presently the word ""liberal"" (in a political context) is defined as one who seeks greater government regulation and an expansion of welfare programs.  However, the original definition of ""liberal"" defined a person who believed in severely limited government and free-market capitalism.  In fact, many founders of the Libertarian movement considered themselves ""liberals.""Even using your ""exact"" definition (assuming that we have an exact definition and not just a colloquial summary, you are still confusing potentiality with possibility.In effect, you are interpreting the definition as if you could say, ""a person has the potential to be hit by a car.""  This makes no logical sense.  That person however exists with that possibility.Indeed, you could argue that the wood has the potential to be a table.  Yes, this is correct when certain linguistic obscurities are overlooked.  The can the wood actually do? Nothing.  That is, until it is made into something.  So what we should say is the wood has the potential to be made into a table, not to be a table.Now, considering your absurd example, If your appendix cell where on the street completely alone, it would not have human rights. It is no longer part of your entity.  This is the same idea as, if your hair falls out in my house or car, I can dispose of it.  It is no longer ""your"" hair.  As long as a thing is connected to you and is of your person-hood it is completely yours and I cannot touch itA fetus is connected to the mother, but it is not of her person-hood and should at least qualify for certain basic rights. Your example of in vitro makes no logical sense.   I never said that a scientifically engineered human wouldn't be human.  I said, the cells that they make them out of are not potential humans, when the cells are considered individually.  Once they have been engineered into a fetus, then they are definitely potential humans. You are quoting me out of context.  My argument was that a single sperm is not ""a potential human until it unites with an egg.""  No, a single sperm will not become a human of its own accord.  It would have to be made into a human.  In essence, it is a potential potentiality, but anything can be broken down into degrees or potential potentiality.  So that is a concept we should stay away from. Anyhow, I would appreciate it if you would not take my statements out of context and apply meanings to them that I never stated. Don't be mistaken, I never once said or implied that I would make   abortion   illegal, nor do I speculate as to the application of these certain basic rights of a fetus or whose, mother's or fetus', rights take precedence in what cases. All I said was you misapplied the concept of potentiality."
1,In what way is this common sense? It took thousands of years of investigation to determine the mechanisms of fertilization and heredity - so its not just obvious by looking! Modern people are split on this issue - so your opinion is not held by some vast majority. Calling your beliefs common sense is an attempt to end debate prematurely. You should apologize for your bad choice of wording.
1,¨When does HUMAN life begin?” should be the question asked.  Carl Sagan’s book ‘The Dragons of Eden’ argues very convincingly that what separates human life and other nonhuman life is the development and functioning of the neocortex.  Therefore he argues that a rational acceptable legal compromise in the   abortion   debate should be that human life begins with the first neocortical EEG signals.  This happens in a human fetus near the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy.  When neocortical EEG signals ends is also a rational legal definition of when a human dies.
2,"Life is an individual right, not a privilege, for unborn humans Mother Teresa, in her amicus brief filed before the U.S. Supreme Court in the cases of Loce v. New Jersey and Krail et al. v. New Jersey in February 1994 - ""Human rights are not a privilege conferred by government. They are every human being’s entitlement by virtue of his humanity. The right to life does not depend, and must not be contingent, on the pleasure of anyone else, not even a parent or sovereign... you must weep that your own government, at present, seems blind to this truth.""[1]
"
1,"Adoption can be as emotionally damaging as abortion. Giving up a child for adoption can be just as emotionally damaging as having an abortion. It is, therefore, not necessarily easier on the mother.
"
1,"The EEG signal is an excellent beginning point. I do find it unlikely that there is really only one point that divides development, not human/fully human."

1,"Couple of questions for you.First of all, Aristotle? Aristotle is relevant in this discussion? Traditionally, one would say ""Aristotle says such-and-such and this is why he's right."" not just ""Aristotle says....so there.""Second, there's a difference between financially dependent, or therapeutically dependent, and organically dependent. You can see this in reverse.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymothoa_exigua  This is a parasitic bug-thing (Don't be put off by my scientific jargon) that attaches to the tongue of a certain fish, drains it of blood, and eventually becomes the fish's replacement tongue. At that point, it stops being it's own bug-thing and becomes part of the fish.Some male spiders do something similar, where they basically mate, atrophy, and become an organ.So an individual organism can simply become a part of another organism. Gestation is this process in reverse."
2,"This is a ill posed question anyway - obviously its not just life we are concerned with, but potential individual human life.  If it were just about eggs and sperm, then we got lots of life to save, lots more than is possible.Common sense is what tells us the earth is flat.  Go figure..."
1,"5 minutes before conception those same potencies are already in existence. We carry some of the ""potencies"" of all our descendants with us right now. In the unbroken chain of descent there are a series of miraculous transformations, one of which is conception. Why do you glorify conception over the others? After conception it is still the genetics of the mother that rule the cell. A fetus's own genetic combination doesn't take over until a short while later, but that is just another of the miracles that occur. How about the eggs first cell division? That is a big one, where the fetus will die if the chromosomes can't dance together. How about gastrulation? An incredible, complex, cellular convolution where the fetus has to prove that it has what it takes. Many fetuses don't make it there. How about implantation - the point where the fetus and mother meet and negotiate terms of gestation. Whatever we decide about the morality of   abortion   has no effect on this fundamental, biological ""choice"" by the womb. How about when the nascent immune system first defines 'self'? How about a heart beat or a meiotic division or a nerve impulse or a breath? Life is a string of miracles, especially during fetal development, and it is not clear to me which one deserves to be held up as the most miraculous. Each milestone is the realization of one of your bundled potencies, and an absolute requirement for all the subsequent ones.I believe that a fetus gains humanity incrementally as it passes each subsequent test. Before the milestones are past a fetus is only potentially a human being - potential is not the same as actual."
1,"In your sense the potential for life is in everything, it is everywhere.  I actually agree - when a man and a woman think, ""child"", right then is when the child comes into being, even in the absolute physical sense.  This is because the physical as well as the metaphysical potentialities are present, all that remains is the act of consummation, which can either take place organically, or in a test tube.  When a man and a woman together think ""child"", but cannot bear one, that is true death of the unborn."
1,"Rome was not built in a day. While we can easily glorify the act of creating something new, it is much harder to pinpoint the instant it happened. In fact, with complex creations, there is no instant to glorify - only a process of incremental accrual of characteristics.Also, there is nothing inevitable about a fetal clump of cells becoming a human being. Many, perhaps most, conceptions fail naturally. Biology is harsh."
2,"You're taking the standpoint that we create each other. God creates us. Before He created the world He knew me.Psalm 139:14-16Life is really wonderful and complicated! What a great work you did!You knew me from the beginning of my making, in which I was completely alone.You saw me before I was born. You know every action, past, present, and future, I will do. You investigated all my actions before the world was created.(modern translation)The arguement that many things die on their own is no justification for one human to take the life of another. We're all going to die of old age- or a car wreck- or a miscarriage. God made life. He can take it. You or I may not.  Talk to women who mourn the children they aborted."
1,"Passing laws on the basis of one religion's beliefs undercuts our freedom of worship. Are you so sure that it would be your religion that ruled? Many people believe that God created the world and the people in it without believing that He attends every conception. Your religious beliefs guide your own actions, but cannot be the basis for regulating or judging others."
2,"You're assuming that universal truth is a matter of opinion or personal belief. The fact is that all our laws are govnerned by personal belief: the ten commandments.  If I chose not to believe any murder is wrong what is to stop me? Someone else's personal belief? The law? Laws can be changed. If I have enough lobbying power to implement my own beliefs over yours and get a ""might makes right"" policy which allows me to murder anyone I can get away with murdering what makes that wrong?  When you take God of the Bible out of the equation, what moral axiom are you standing on? Everything becomes justified through individual belief.  People didn't believe blacks had human rights. Did that make it so because it was their personal belief?  The ancient Greeks didn't believe that women had souls. Were they right because it was their personal belief? I can't let the murder of the unborn stay as a law because someone else doesn't think the unborn has rights.  You or anyone else who is in favor of   abortion   are most certainly imposing your personal beliefs on a whole population of humans: the unborn."
2," Unborn life should never depend on whether it is ""wanted"" Graciela Olivarez, Chicana civil rights and anti-poverty activist, 1972 - ""The poor cry out for justice and equality, and we respond with legalized abortion. I believe that in a society that permits the life of even one individual to be dependent on whether that life is ‘wanted’ or not, all its citizens stand in danger...We do not have equal opportunities. Abortion is a cruel way out.""[22] 
"
1,"Our society is governed by laws, not by universal truth. It is a practical necessity given the slippery nature of universal truths. Society, religion, and law all change over time.The God of the Bible is the deity of many different religions, which have serious disagreements about the moral interpretation of their varied, updated translations of the bible. Not surprisingly, we each believe our current one is right.You are attempting to establish an absolute, but I see nothing here that is well-defined or unchanging.  It is certainly not clear that conception is inherently more important than a host of other miraculous events in the continuation of human life. Each is necessary, but none are individually sufficient. Life is worth protecting at every point, but not equally so."
2,"It's interesting to me how you can not make the assertion about absolutes without contradicting yourself. ""Life is worth protecting but not equally so"" That's an absolute statement. And besides, says who? Because you don't believe life is worth protecting at every point that makes it so?Those laws that govern our society are based on moral absolutes that stem directly from the ten commandments. As I've already said, when you take God out of the equation you are on the ""slippery slope"" you speak of and are reduced to personal beliefs.That doesn't change the nature of God or the moral code He's prescribed for mankind.  Frankly I see a direct correlation between the rejecting of God and the increasing lawlessness of our society. Our laws, without the belief in God to back them up, don't motivate many people to follow them. You state that society, religion and law all change over time (that's another absolute statement) but I have not seen morals change.  That is, I haven't seen people's attitudes about how they think they should be treated change.  No one thinks they should be lied to or cheated on or stolen from.  No one thinks others have the right to murder them. It seems to me you are basically saying that everything changes and it's all a matter of perspective so it's impossible to know anything. If that is so what are you basing your own arguement on?  It's only if there are moral absolutes- slavery is wrong-all men are created equal-child abuse is wrong-the genocide of 7 million Jews is wrong- that we have something to stand on. If there are no moral absolutes how do we know when to change laws or correctly interpret them?  If you don't believe in moral absolutes by what criteria are you basing your belief that it is right to end the life of babies in the womb? If there is no God, what paradigm is there to go by? Nothing: each man does what is right in their own eyes. In which case if you're the strongest and richest you get your way and if your weaker and poorer you're out of luck."
2,"The issue isn't whether things die naturally (many fetuses die in the womb,bioloby is harsh) but rather do we as humans have the right to kill an unborn child.  One could argue that after a baby is born it could catch pneumonia and die (biology is harsh) but does that give you or me the right to stop the life of another person?  God says before the creation of the world He knew me.  Life begins when God planned my life.  He's the only one with the right to take it away. Not someone who can devalue others with a lot of ""intelligent sounding"" rhetoric. Have you talked to women who mourn the death of the children who they aborted? "
1,"I hope you understand that I ask this quesiton in all seriouness, in an effort to understand your worldview. If life begins when God planned your life, and God has planned your life since before the beginning of creation, than that would seem to mean that you have always been alive. Is that true? Wouldn't it follow then that, for example, a 10-year-old girl is already carrying in her the life God planned her to give birth to in the future?I hope that made sense. Any clarification you could give would be appreciated. "
2,"I am not God and cannot hope to understand all there is about Him. But I know what He says in the Bible. He planned me and it says He knew me before the creation of the world.  How that happens, I don't know, I don't need to know.  The point is God planned all life and we as humans don't have the right to kill life at any stage. And yes I agree that a girl is already carrying the life God planned for her to give birth to. In Hebrews 7:9,10 it states: ""One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham, because when Melchisedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.""People seem to be clever at engaging in discussion at when life begins. Anyone who has ever become pregnant (as I have) gets excited the second they know they are pregnant. We don't wait until the baby is ""viable"".Also, I know many women who are spending the rest of their life mourning the baby they aborted. No intellectual arguement is going to argue their grief away. I hope I satisfactorily answered your question. "
1,"There is no point in engaging in discussion if the basis of the discussion is in emotion. Emotion may inform our thinking, but ultimately any real discussion must come down to logic. Many aspects of life are emotional. Our emotions exist to aid us, but they are not perfect. A mother mourning for the death of her unborn child is both logical and illogical; logical because she can understand the joy she would have had with the child, illogical because there was no actual conscious being there and the feelings stem from raw emotion. When a woman chooses whether to have an   abortion  , they may feel horrible about it, but know that it is the best decision. Those that regret what they've done because they feel they have done something wrong are free to feel that way, but that should not cause us to restrict the choice of others."
2,"It's true that one's feelings do not determine truth. There are many who commit murder without a qualm.  You make the statement, ""When a woman chooses whether to have an   abortion   they may feel horrible about it but know that it is the best decision."" How do you prove that assertion? On the premise that abortion isn't murder? What if your premise is wrong?You also state her grief is illogical because there was no conscious being there.  Is it ok to murder people as long as they're not conscious- such as when they're asleep? Anyway how do you scientifically prove or define the consciousness of another.  Maybe we should kill people with Alzehimers.A woman grieves the loss of her baby because she knows exactly what it was: her very own offspring.  It's perfectly logical to mourn the loss of one's own child.  Everyone has to base their beliefs on some sort of paradigm.  As a Christian I am basing my paradigm on something outside myself. I'm basing it on what God has revealed to mankind through the Bible.  If you don't base your beliefs on God's word what are you basing it on? Your own limited understanding? You aren't omniscient so the most you should do is at least err on the side of life: ""I'm not sure it's murder so to be on the safe side I'll choose life."" If you can devalue life at one level you can devalue it at any level. As John Donne said, if even a simpleton is killed I am the lesser. We are all a part of mankind and no one has the right to take another's life- not even at it's simplest and most helpless state. Finally, your statement that those that regret abortion are free to feel that way but that should not cause us to restrict the choice of others.  No, our feelings should not restrict others' choices and behaviors but right and wrong should.  People knew it was wrong to keep slavery legal so they abolished it.  People knew it was wrong to force young children to work as adults so laws were implemented to prevent it. It's wrong to discriminate against people based on the color of their skin or gender. Because there is such a thing as right or wrong we enforce laws that maintain right and wrong and we change laws that don't (such as slavery or segregation).  Just because abortion is legal doesn't make it right.  One day I believe people will look back in horror at the 40+million unborn children that have been murdered in our country.  "
1,"It looks like we agree that the emotion of the mother does not change whether the act of   abortion   is right or wrong. Also, just to clarify, when I said that a mother's grief is illogical, I should have said that it is without logic, that is, based on emotion. There may be cases where the mother considers what might have come of the child, but when we're talking about a situation where the mother believes she made the appropriate decision but still feels grief, I would venture to say that most of the grief does not stem from a logical place. I might be making this more confusing, but perhaps it is clearer to simply say that someone can grieve both logically and emotionally at the same time, and the emotion may result from logical and illogical bases.Now on to the other interesting points you bring up. The first is sleep. This is indeed the sort of discussion I think we all should be having. If it is wrong to kill someone who is asleep, and our value of a person is not based on potential, why is it wrong. The first reason is that the person is conscious prior to going to sleep, and must go to sleep in order to sustain consciousness and health in the long term. Additionally, since we all must sleep, if you want to not be killed while asleep then you should not kill someone else who is asleep. A fetus has no conception of any of this, does not think, and cannot make any decisions. An additional reason I would say a live person has more value is that they have accumulated experience in their life that has value in many ways, both personally and to other people (friends, product of their work(s), etc).I would say that a person with advanced Alzheimer's Disease has less value than someone who does not have the disease, all else being equal. I do not believe that makes it ok to kill that person. It would impact a decision such as who's life I would save if I had to make a choice. I also think these terms extend to animals. Essentially, I value an entity's combination of types and amounts of cognitive abilities along with experience, potential, and the value others place on that entity. So to me, an unborn child has no value other than that the parents place on it when first conceived, up to some amount less than the value of the mother up to and even past birth.I welcome questions about what I've laid out as well as challenges."
2,"Do you really believe you are are sovereign over your own body?  The Bible says all our days are numbered and tomorrow is promised to no man.  You have no more control over your life than if you could change the weather.  God is sovereign and that is exactly what is so evil about   abortion  .  People assuming they are sovereign and have the right to murder others- even more horrific- their own flesh and blood.     How in the world do you deduce that giving life through carrying your baby to term dehumanizes you? Giving life doesn't dehumanize us, taking it away does.  The ultimate form of slavery and dehumanization is when a person does not value another's life.  If we can not value the life of our own   children   when they are in the womb what makes any life valuable?  When one does not trust God and His sovereignty, even in instances of rape, life has no meaning or hope.  When one trusts God's sovereignty we know that even   pregnancy   from rape can bring hope and meaning.    Aborting a baby conceived from rape will not rid the mother of the trauma of rape it only compounds it by making her guilty of murder.    "
2,"Of course it should be banned. Abortion became legal in America in the 1800s and was banned -became illegal - when Americans got their consciences back through a spiritual revival across the nation. At the bare minimum abortion is the taking of one person's life. But when you consider that most people have children and their children have children, it opens a whole nother door regarding the massiveness of just one act of abortion. It equals genocide - on a massive, massive scale. My position is that abortion is unconscionable and should forever be banned and illegal."
2," ""Unwanted"" children can be adopted; abortion is unnecessary  Mother Teresa of Calcutta quotes (Albanian born Indian Missionary and Founder of the Order of the Missionaries of Charity. Nobel Prize for Peace in 1979. 1910-1997) - ""These concerns (for orphan children in India and elsewhere in the world) are very good, but often these same people are not concerned with the millions that are killed by the deliberate decision of their own mothers. And this is what is the greatest destroyer of peace today, Abortion...For the pregnant women who don't want their children, give them to me.""[23]
"
1,"Abortion became legal in America in the 1800s and was banned -became illegal - when Americans got their consciences back through a spiritual revival across the nation.What's funny is that the number of abortions performed were higher when abortion was illegal than when it was legal, and since Roe vs Wade, abortions have continually decreased, especially since the 80s. And, keeping it illegal doesn't stop abortions from happening. It never has. So instead of a legal procedure, being conducted in a safe environment, we're going to end up with a bunch of illegal abortions, in unsafe and unregulated environments.At the bare minimum abortion is the taking of one person's life.At the bare minimum, it's the destruction of an accumulation of cells. Depending on the week or trimester, a zygote is not alive--can't even respond to stimuli, and therefore cannot be murdered or killed.But when you consider that most people have children and their children have children, it opens a whole nother door regarding the massiveness of just one act of abortion.No, it doesn't. A zygote isn't a ""class of people"", it isn't even a person yet. There are more murdersMy position is that abortion is unconscionable and should forever be banned and illegal.So? Unconscionable doesn't mean it should be made illegal."
2,"sigh I want to say yes for the most part. I think if people are mature enough to have sex (knowing the consequences of it), they should be mature enough to handle the fallout from it. It should not be used as a form of birth control. If you don't want a child, don't have sex. Simple as that.BUT, then the issue of rape comes into play. Along with the health of the mother at risk. These are two major issues that throw a wrench into my thoughts on abortion. But those would be the only reasons I feel abortion would be ""acceptable""."
2,"Abortion should definitely banned except when the mothers life may be at risk. In any other situation, there are plenty of other options such as adoption."
1,You give no reasons to for your opinion... please do so. Im interested in this topic
2,in my opinion it should be because if you don't want to get pregnant why are you having sexual activity
1,"Because sexual activity is awesome and a sign of good health. It is a primal action that is at the foundation of humans' hierarchy of needs (according to Maslow: http://www.colinchristianson.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/800px-maslows_hierarchy_of_needssvg.png)                                        ) So stopping sex is not the solution to the abortion debate. People do need to be careful and do need to be held accountable for their actions, but accidents happen and shouldn't people be able to have a choice in how to deal with such a life-altering event?"
1,What if the woman in question was a victim of rape or incest? Should they have to go through that?
1,what about rape?? then what? should that poor girl go through her life looking at the child of a rapist?
2,thats what the other debater said. unless it was an accident or her life was in dangerr
1,"ok and like i saidd, every mothere should have her own desicon on whether or not they want to go through a pregancy. For instance what if it wasnt a accident to have the child and the mother found out that her soon to be baby was special ed. so she desided to get an abortion. I know she's killin a life and i do think thats wrong, but in the same way she might want to protect that unborn from going through pain and trials in the future... Let me remind you that the title of this argument "" Abortion should be Banned"". Thats a straight forward yes or no question and since there are "" what if's"" (what if it is rape, what if it's an aciddent , ect.) in this situation the conclusion is that Abortions should'nt be banned."
2,"Support can be provided to women that don't want or can't handle a child. Ronald Reagan, ""Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation"", Human Life Review, Spring 1984. - ""As we continue to work to overturn Roe v. Wade, we must also continue to lay the groundwork for a society in which abortion is not the accepted answer to unwanted pregnancy. Pro-life people have already taken heroic steps, often at great personal sacrifice, to provide for unwed mothers.""[24]

2,"Why should a mother have the right to dispose of her 'mistake'? Dont want a baby?, dont have sex!!!"
1,"I dont think you really read my comment. your missing my point. The topic is "" Abortion Should be banned"" and sense therre ar diffrent situations such as "" accidents"" and ""rape"" abortion shouldnt be banned."
2,"OK but what about all the other cases, which are probably 90% of abortions? Why should someone be allowed to get an abortion just because they do not want to live with the consequences of their actions?"
2,"No, she should give it up for adoption and be proud she gave a loving home a child they would not have had otherwise."
1,"i agree that that definatly did not convince me at all that it should be banned and i think you mean too ""reasons to for your opinion"""
1,"I personally believe abortion is an awful thing to consider for a person. If someone in my life tried to get an abortion, I would do everything in my power besides actually tying them to a chair to keep them from getting it. But I absolutely do not believe the government should ban abortion. That is completely out of their jurisdiction and authority. I believe greater education is the answer to prevent teen pregnancy and the fallacy that abortion is just another form of birth control. This will make the choice of aborting your child a much more serious question and the personal decision will be made more responsibly."
1,Although abortion is such a sadening thing that hurts me i dont feel that it should be banned. Every mother should have the right to do what they want to do and what they think is best.
2,What about the child who has no say? When do we start holding people accountable for their actions?
1,it is also the mother's choice. the child doesnt have no say. as i said they shouldnt be having any sexual activity. i am 11 and i know this....
2,"Its not a child , its a fetus. It has no feelings at all! abortions are made to early for the fetus to feel anything."
2," Abortion is not a just response to social problems facing the unborn If a child is likely to face social difficulties, this is absolutely no reason to seek an abortion. The notion that a child will be unhappy due to these conditions or will have no chances of success is ludicrous. It is easy to find examples of poor and neglected children that have grown up to become thriving, successful, and happy adults. In any case, if social problems are the concern, these problems should be addressed; abortion is a terrible band-aid. Saying that a child would encounter social problems during his or her development is not the same as saying that he or she is better off dead.
"
1,isnt that a good thing that they dont feel anything? would you want the fetus to feel it?
2,"True however, we were all a fetus at one time, therefore, it is the beginning of life. A life that many families are dieing to take care of because they cannot have children of their own."
1,your right they shouldnt be haveing sex but they do and they are not about to stop if they dont even want to wear a condom
2,"OK so their not going to stop so we should just not hold them accountable? This is the problem with the world today, nobody is accountable."
1,you dont a women to have a baby who cant afford it and it would have a bad life do you?
2,thats when the seriousness comes in. thats when abortion is required. BUT THERES ADOPTION~~
2,Why not? She can give the child to someone who wants it. Many families are looking to adopt.
1,ok its not a person until the baby comes out it can kill you to give birth
1,oh and it is something that lives off of you that can kill you like oh say...a tumor?
1,"I think that you shouldn't have more than.... 3 abortions. Birth control... there's an idea! I'm against abortion with the exception of rape and ABSOLUTE emergencies. I don't know... I've never been in that situation before, but accidents happen to everyone. So it's mos def possible."

1,"Yes, I am not a woman therefore I do not have the rite to tell a woman that she cannot have an abortion after she has been raped. Who are men to decide what a woman must do? What would you guys do if the gov told you to stop killing potential life via beating off? It would seem ludicrous"
1,"Of course, it's not my place to decide someone's life besides my own."
2,Then why are you pro choice!?
1,Perhaps you misunderstand the meaning of Pro-Choice. Everyone deserves the right to work towards the life they want and the people they want to be with. Laws that inhibit freedom of choice are killing this nation.
2,"Everyone has the right to avoid unwanted pregnancy. I think abstinence works best. I am pro abstinence and pro life. People that are pro choice and yet don't choose to be smart and avoid unwanted pregnancy are the ones that are ""killing this nation""."
1,"Not everyone wants to live that way. I'm not saying a lavish life of sin and making out with everyone you meet is a good idea. It's a terrible idea, but some people just don't like the idea of abstinence either. And what if you take all of the measures against pregnancy and it still happens to creep up anyways?Do not forget that there are cases of pregnancy through rape. Would you want to carry a rape child? I don't think I would."
2,"Don't get me wrong you can live however you want, just be willing to except the consequence.(read Joe's post) Take care of that kid, or at least put them up for adoption. Its not his or her fault that their parents wanted to live a certain way. The baby has the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I don't care how small or undeveloped the thing is. About the rape case; no of course I would not want to carry a rape child. But I wouldn't kill the thing. I usually try to do the right thing. Which is sometimes what I don't necessarily want for myself. That's the lifestyle that I choose to live. If it were me personally I would put the baby up for adoption. Because the best way for a kid to be raised is with a mother and a father."
1,"Could I ever personally see my mate go through abortion? See my seed fade away? No never. It would burn into my very heart and leave a big scar. But there are people out there who are willing. Those people deserve that choice even if it means that a life won't enter this world. They're just hurting themselves, but it's not my choice and I won't stop them."
2,"A woman must bear the pain/risks of birth; the life of the fetus is worth it. If the woman was the only consideration in abortions, than it might make sense for them to avoid the pain of child-birth. But, her interests are not the only ones in play. The life of the fetus is very important as well. Preserving the life of the fetus is worth the risks and pains incurred by the woman in child-birth. 
"
2,"""Those people deserve that choice even if it means that a life won't enter this world.""So then the baby doesn't have a chance at live? The chance to choose anything!? Ever?People deserve choice. But the unborn deserve a chance to live."
1,"Once again, that's not my decision. The choice however should be there for people who demand it."
1,"How about every sperm or egg that is wasted? Those can be considered ""chances"" at life. Should we make masturbation illegal as well?At the point of conception, all there is, is a clump of cells. To say that this clump of cells should have the same rights as a human being, is simplistic.Obviously there needs to be a point where a fetus becomes a person, however, this is certainly not at the point of conception. It can't breathe, see, feel, or think. As the law currently is, abortions are legal at up to about 24 weeks. Whether this is too early or too late is an issue of debate, however, getting rid of abortion entirely, is both unrealistic, and an infringement on the individual rights of women.Arguing that the only reason abortion should be legal is so that potential unborns have a chance at life does not take into account the billions of ""potential"" lives are wasted every day. Should we make sex mandatory for every girl who reaches puberty so that each egg has the opportunity to become a human? Obviously not. So what is the difference between a sperm and an egg that are separated, and a recently fertilized egg? Not much."
2,"No, no, I don't think that every sperm and egg has a chance at life, of course not, come on. Give me more credit than that. Thats stupid. I respect the law as it exists. And I stand by everything els I said."

Maybe the thought of an Innocent baby dying affects me, maybe that baby would have made a big difference in the world. Maybe that baby would have been my friend."
1,"I read everything you wrote jake all your responses, who are you to decide for a woman? It should have nothing to do with men at all, it should be the carriers' choice not ours. Your not the one giving birth to a child conceived through rape. You are not having that baby attached to you. You are not the one that got raped Jake therefore who are you to speak for the side of pro life when you are not conceiving the baby?"
2,I am not deciding anything. I am voicing my opinion. Who am I to do that? An American citizen.
1,... not saying it is going to be a law but that is what I got out of what you said. that you have decided that abortion is wrong to which I respond who are you to decide that abortion is wrong since you are looking through the perspective of a man? Is the rape victim carrying the baby not a WOMAN? is it not her BODY ? I would repeat everything I wrote but I find that to be somewhat pointless.
2,Who are you to decide that abortion is right since you are looking through the perspective of a man?Last time I checked this debate is not reserved for raped women. That's like saying the people in Washington can only make laws if they have been in the certain situation.
1," It is just for a mother to abort a fetus to save herself In such cases of medical emergency and in the interest of saving a women's life, surely it is permissible to abort the fetus. To argue otherwise would be to uphold the rights of the unborn over the living, which is wrongheaded and immoral.
"
1,"I am saying it should not be the choice of a man, definately not saying this debate is for raped women only I just think that the people that make the laws in Washington should have women decide on this law not men since there are more men in Washington politics. No it is not really saying that it is common sense most laws . Manslaughter is illegal for obvious reasons people do not argue that it should be legal. Abortion is controversial and since it is we should have women making the final decision on the matter."
2,You are confusing me. Are you saying that men don't have the right to be pro life? Or that men don't ever have a say at the choice of abortion? Or that men should not be able to vote on if it should be a law? What is it?What if I get married and my wife gets pregnant and she decides that she wants an abortion(Not that I would marry a woman that doesn't want kids). Don't I have a say? Isn't it my kid to?
1,I am saying that men should not have the deciding vote on the matter which really they do. Since women are outnumbered in our gov just like all govs. I am not saying that you do not have the right to voice your opinion and if my wife and I had a baby I would not want her to have an abortion but if she was raped then I think it would be up to her. ( I would not want to have a baby if it was from rape )

1,"Legal abortion protects women with serious illnesses that are vulnerable. Tens of thousands of women have heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia and severe diabetes, and other illnesses that are made worse by childbearing. Legal abortion helps women avert these unavoidable risks to their health and lives. 
"
1,"A wise choice. The pro-life argument usually boils down to ""the fetus' is more important than the mother"", and they rarely give it more thought than that, and so the debate usually just goes around in circles, as we see here with Jake.Most pro-choicers don't like abortion, and want it minimized, but realize that the best person to make the decision is the person whose life it effects most, the woman's.Interestingly, evolution tends to give most women a ""mother instinct"" that fights the impulse to abort. Of course, a lot of pro-life Christians also tend to disbelieve in evolution, so their venem towards pro-choice is partially modivated by some fear that without pro-lifers like themselves, everyone would run out and have abortions 5 times a day."
2,I chose to be pro life didn't I? (;
1,"It's not right for me to make the choices or to allow the government to make the choices in someone else's life. It's not just because of some high morality or anything, but I can't support ideas like that simply because I would not want anyone doing that to me. Without life's simple choices, there is no true freedom."
1,"I am pro choice because 1: Whether or not to have an abortion is a personal medical decision by the woman carrying the baby about what to do with her own body. The fate of her fetus is not the business of anyone except her and her doctor. 2: A fetus is not a human being, meaning terminating a pregnancy is not murder. For evidence of this consider whether a first or second trimester fetus could live on its own, without the asistance of the mother or medical technology. Also consider that the bible does not consider fetuses legal human beings (Exodus 21:22-25), so there is no religious argument supporting the pro life position. 3: People should not be punished for birth control failing, for being uninformed about how babies are made or for general immaturity. A baby is an extremely expensive thing, if two parents were unprepared financially or lack the maturity necessary to raise a child in modern times then a pregnancy could ruin the lives of not only the parents but of the child as well. 4: An unplanned pregnancy can have negative consequences not only for the mother, father and child, but also for the society they are a part of. If this family was not financially able to raise a child, the public ends up paying for them through welfare programs, etc... I would rather see my tax dollars go to more productive causes. 5: If abortion were illegal and considered murder then the mother who had the abortion would have to be prosecuted for first degree murder. I find that morally wrong but I also find it economically wrong as it will increase the prison population and once again redirect my tax dollars from causes I'd rather see them go to."
1,"I also come to believe that every one of us has the right to do what we think is right. Gays wants to get married, well that's their choice and I think we should respect that. But I am never pro of abortion this is way too sensitive. I think we should treat life more sacredly. It is morally wrong as we all know. It was killing another human life no matter what we push that fetuses are not babies."
1,"it is someones choice on how they live their life and we should not be the ones to determine on how they should live it. If someone wants to do something that would be disapproved by many, well thats their decision."
2,"The Bible is the only book to have thousands of it's prophecies and none have been close to what it says but 100% right. It tells of the earth being round, the atom,the auto, the radio, TV, wars of the past, and at what point life starts. Anyone saying they don't believe in God has never read it. I would rather be pro life than pro choice. The Bible is clear in at what point life begins and is not above it's pay grade."
1,"Are you serious? It's amazing how people only discover these amazing predictions only after science discovers them. News flash, the Bible doesn't predict anything. You're just seeing want you want to see."
2,"I consider abortion murder... I don't condone murder except in war, very rare cases of abortion, and some cases of euthanasia, especially indirect euthanasia, when the patient is not given resuscitation or any machines for life support, thus allowing him or her to die on his or her own."
2,"There are many arguments to both sides of this issue, but I think the arguments for being pro-life are way better than the one's for being pro-choice. First of all, no matter how much you deny it, cover it up, or lie about it, abortion is killing someone. You can keep telling yourself that it isn't, but it is. That's against the law just to let you know. It is against my religion and that is one of the reasons why I think it is wrong, but I can argue from a secular point of view also. The Declaration of Independence lists three inalienable rights: LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Isn't killing an innocent baby taking all three of these rights away from it? Also, one argument for being pro-choice is that restrictions on abortion are a violation to rights of privacy, but privacy is not mentioned once in the constitution. Besides, isn't the right to life a little more important the right to privacy? If the baby itself is not causing any real danger to the mother, then she does not have the right to takes its life a way."
1,"If abortion in self-defense is OK, a fetus cannot have a general right to life Opponents of abortion often argue that a fetus has an inviolable right to life. Yet, it is easy to demonstrate that this is not the case. It is always permissible to take a life in self-defense. This principle can be applied to abortion. And, importantly, it also demonstrates that there is no such thing as an ""inviolable right to life"". There are always conditional exceptions. So, if we can show that the conditions are appropriate (even beyond self-defense), an abortion can be justified, even if it is ""killing"".  
"
1,"First of all, no one's saying abortion isn't killing someone, so please stop that scarecrow argument.The pro-choice argument is that aborting a fetus is justified in certain circumstances (health risks, rape, incest). Even in cases where the mother is simply unprepared to raise a child, I'd still argue abortion should be an option, since not all unwanted babies are adopted, and end up getting screwed up in the foster system.Ultimately, the pregnacy effects the pregnant woman infinitely more than it effects you or me, so it's logical that the woman is in the best position to make the choice about what she wants to do. I personally hope it isn't abortion, but it's not our call."
2,"You just agreed with me that abortion is killing someone and not something. Isn't it against the law to kill an innocent person? I know that a lot of times it is extremely difficult to for a woman to cope with an unplanned pregnancy, but i think that ultimately, the government should make abortion illegal, but in turn provide programs to help the woman through this hard time and make the right choice in what to do with the child after birth, whether it would be adoption, or keeping the baby, in order to preserve life. I also think that the government should provide more funding for to take care of the children in the foster care system. It may be true that we shouldn't tell other people how to live their lives or what they can and can't do, but isn't that what we attempt to do whenever we vote?"
1,"Yes, because abortion being illegal is about as useful as making masterbation illegal,both are impossible to impose,and both kill an equal number of potential little lives,actually masterbation kills way more if you're a dude, but I'm not here for semantics... this time.So at the very least making it legal in the case of rape (yeah, we all knew what you meant, funny wording though) there's an opening for some future logical debate on the topic.Of course you would just have hordes of chicks describing mythical rape seens in dark alleys just to get the procedure. And yet again, not a single abortion would have been stopped."
1,"because abortion being illegal is about as useful as making masterbation illegal,And sure as hell there will be a huge outrage if that would ever happen. Either that or the government would become a laughing stock. (;"
1,I never though about it as killing millions of little lives... How depressing. :.(
1,"Damn thats a good point, I never thought about it that way. If abortion was illegal it would just have women revert to the old ways IE close hangers. Or women would just say they were raped to get an abortion in the end it would be terrible for the feds to make abortion illegal, also I think it should be women deciding this not men. If women were trying to tell us men not to masturbate what would we tell them?"
1,"Friday, post your argument as an argument rather than the debate description, so people can Favor/Opppose and Vote Up/Down.If you want to call all abortion murder, then fine, it's all murder. So are executions, euthanasia, and stepping on snails. If a fetus is undeveloped enough to not even have consciousness, then killing it is just fine by me. The world's overpopulated enough as it is. The people who want to abort their child but can't-- how well do you think they'll treat it once it's alive? Not to mention the fact that those who are barred from getting an abortion will just go and find a place to get one anyway. Usually somewhere far less safe than a hospital. The war on abortion is just as misguided as the war on drugs for this reason."
2,You just compared the life of a human fetus to a snail. ..
1,"At the point of conception, what really is the difference? Infact, the snail is more alive than a fetus. If you're talking purely about potential then what's the difference between ovulating and a very early term abortion? Both kill something that isn't yet life but has the potential to be life.This whole abortion argument really centres around at what state a ball of cells suddenly takes on the magical label of ""human life."""
1,"A snail has more consciousness than a fetus, until the third trimester+.So does a woman who contracts cervical cancer from HPV, but the ""Life is sacred"" crowd seem to value her life even less than the snail.+ Of pregnancy, not snaildom."
2," A fetus is uniquely capable of becoming a person; deserves rights It is unquestionable that the fetus, at whatever stage of development, will inevitably develop the traits of a full-grown human person. It will also inevitably accumulate all of the rights that you yourself have. If we deprive the unborn of life via abortions, however, they will be deprived of all of this potential and future rights. This is why extending a right to life is of utmost importance; the future of the unborn depends on it.
"
2,"A child should not be killed to save a mother: Whilst these are different circumstances, and such medical emergencies are tragic, it is by no means obvious that the abortion is to be performed. The ‘mother vs. child’ dilemma is one which defies solution, and aborting to preserve one of the lives sets a dangerous precedent that it is acceptable to kill a person in order to save another. This is a clear, and unpalatable, case of treating a human-being as a means to an end.
"
2,"just because human life is most helpless and unaware at that point in life (early stages after conception), that doesn't mean you have the right to kill it."
1,"Yes, it does. When the alternative is possibly ruining the life of the mother, her consciousness takes priority.EDIT: I hope you read this argument when my score is still 666. Funny context."
1,WHO MAKES THESE QUESTIONS UP OF COURSE IT SHOULD
1,I think abortion should be illegal in all cases except: (a) rape or (b) when the baby is physically hurting the mother.
1,"""because abortion being illegal is about as useful as making masterbation illegal,""This is not the same case, there is no life forming when you are doing your own thing as compared to the life that takes place after the conception. A gamete would still remain a gamete if there's no union that occur. We are talking here about the formed life and not the ""half-life"" that you suggest. In that case we're all be murderers of little life."
1,"Yes, but now I have dillema for all you ""you're a murderer if you abort!""Assume (but these situations really do occur) that a lady is 7 months pregnant. She goes to the doctor from pain in her belly and wants to be assured everything is OK. She finds out she has a serious complication that in which, she has to make a decision: a) wait at least another month hoping she can last that long so the baby can be born (prematurely, but hopefully alive enough to survive) and she dies, guaranteed, or b) abort the child for her life. Which one should she pick? If she picks b) does that mean she's a selfish bitch and a ""murderer"" just because she wanted to live longer for, probably, her children she already has, her husband, and because letting her child have her life without his mother would suck just as much itself? (Even though, in most of these cases, the mother will pick option a0 and the husband will try to talk her out of it).So, sure, you can call abortion murder as much as you all want, but it's getting really out of hand. For someone to make a wise and rational decision of aborting a fetus for whatever their reason, takes a lot more guts than you'll ever think. Also to mention, to put the word ""Murder"" up there is just REALLY low. I mean, you're making all these women feel like they should probably commit suicide by having a murder label on them. It's harsh. Alas, what if we gave an eldery person a drug so they could finally pass away upon their wishes? I'm sure that would be in the same category as ""Murder"" yet, a lot of people are fighting for something like this to be legal itself (it's only legal with doctor consent in Oregon). So, really, I don't think abortion is murder, nor do I think it is a selfish, I think all of you calling it murder and selfish are selfish. :-)"
1,"i most def. think that it should be still legal for those who have been raped. These girls would have been raped and then have a new situation they also have to deal with along with the rape, and that could be stressful. For those of you that says that the reason for it to not be legal is cause its murder, it technically is not murder because if someone is raped and then find out they are pregnate would be in such a short time spand that the baby would not even be an embryo yet. there are those situations where it is an embryo but it had no human connection what so ever. it has never created memories or even knows what is going on, so if it were to be killed by abortion i feel as if it would not really matter."
1,"Up to a certain point, yes. I really despise all abortions that aren't performed for the mother's health, but rape is a little bit different. And even then, I would only want the abortion to be performed up to a month, maybe two, after the rape."
1,"Although I don't think that abortions should be illegal at all, if it were to be, I think that rape victims should legally be able to have abortions.My sole reason: They did not choose to have sex."
1,"As a pro-choice advocate, I have no reason to support the other side."
2," Abortions under ""trying circumstances"" are the exception not the rule Most abortions are performed entirely voluntarily by women that have the means to raise a child, but simply don't want to. While emergency abortions or abortions under trying circumstances such as rape are held out as reasons to continue to have abortions, they are infrequent and serve more to provide cover for voluntarily ""life-style"" abortions. This is wrong.
"
2,"No, because there are emergency contraceptives that women can take up to 72 hours once she was raped that would prevent the sperm from going into her egg."
2,"no, every person that is meant to be brought into this world or if theres a living thing inside you it must have a reason god gave it a reason to be there, dont think oh god wanted me to be rapped no maybe god jsut thought this child belonged to you thats what i think im 15 yrs old and i think everything in the world has a reason to live."
1,"We are talking about legality, so we're talking about laws. Therefore the word god should not even appear anywhere in your argument, let alone be the main point."
1,"the reason i have chosen against this argument of abortion being murder in the case of incest or rape is because, you have stated that rape of a women is exactly the same as having sex without a condom. This is completely false, she has not chosen to have sex with the man who raped her, she has not chosen that she did not want to use protection. a women who chooses with someone she is planning to have sex with is at fault for getting pregnant. Those are two completely different scenarios and i am appalled that you would come the least bit close to saying that it is the womens fault for getting pregnant in a situation she did not choose, how dare you! If you were raped and got pregnant would you want the baby of the man who torments your every nightmare to be growing inside you, to further remind you of the horrific thing that happened to you."
2,"Rape is horrible action, but murder is worse and abortion is murder. Punishing the baby for what some wacko did is wrong. I do not mean to offend anyone but some women might lie about getting raped so they can get rid of a baby. It would be really complicated."
1,"So you think that a woman should be forced to carry around the child of her rapist for nine months, risking her health and her job?"
2,You can not get fired for being pregnant. I think that abortion in any context is wrong even in rape. The woman should not punish the baby the rapist should be held financially responsible. He should have his money allocated the mother.
1,"You can't get fired just for being pregnant, but you can't really work in your third trimester, and not all jobs allow for maternal leaves of absence. That's really disgusting that you think a woman should have to bear the bastard offspring of her rapist. If that's what you think, there is nothing I can do to convince you."
2,"Well I think abortion is disgusting. Abortion can lead to problems that are far worse than rape, like infections of the uterus and sterilization. There is also a risk of hemorrhaging."
1,I don't know a woman who would choose rape over an infection.
2," Letting a woman die is better than directly killing an unborn baby There is a difference between letting a woman die from the presence of a fetus and the process of giving birth and actively killing a fetus. One is ""letting die"", the other is ""killing"". The distinction is important, and is a good reason to oppose abortion even during special emergencies.
"
2,That is not what I said. I was trying to say Abortion can be very risky so women should think about that before they get the abortion.
1,I agree they should think about. But how is that justification for making abortion illegal? Again please respond to my other post hereI look forward to your response.
1,"Yeah. And they catch like all the rapists, and always hold them responsible.(Sarcasm)Even if they catch the rapists, they incarcerate them. So no income."
2,"If they catch him they can clear out his bank account and give to the woman he raped an impregnated. Plus, it was just an idea that I through out there I never said it was flawless."
1,"Assuming he has a bank account..The point is that these things are never flawless. In fact they are life shattering for the woman. Being raped alone can ruin a woman, I couldn't imagine having to actually carry that baby. The thing is, you don't know what it's like psychologically, so you don't know what you're doing or who you're hurting by supporting this view.And you might never..."
1,"Rape is horrible action, but murder is worse and abortion is murder.Why is it murder?"
2,It kills the unborn baby. The baby ceases to exsit so it is murdered.
1,It kills the unborn baby. The baby ceases to exsit so it is murdered.Kind of circular don't you think? Let's further constrain the question then: at what point does a bundle of cells become 1) life and 2) human life?
2,I believe that life occurrs at conception. That is what I believe. You can believe something different and will respect that.
1,"I believe that life occurrs at conception.Then what does it mean to be ""alive"" at that point?That is what I believe.Why?"
1," Abortion must be justified in cases of impregnation by rape Woman, and in some cases girls, who have been raped should not have to suffer the additional torment of being pregnant with the product of that ordeal. To force a woman to produce a living, constant reminder of that act is unfair on both mother and child.
"
1,"So you think it is a baby, the moment the sperm fertilizes the egg?"
2,Yes I do. Abortion is never the answer.When do you think life occurs?
1,"While it may technically be alive from the moment of conception, it is irrelevant. I doubt you think life itself is sacred and should never be killed, because, and this may be an unreasonable assumption, you've probably washed your hands before and killed thousands of bacteria. I think human life is important, not sacred, but important. And some human lives are more important than others. Given the choice between saving a young, healthy child, and an old dying man, I would have to choose the child. The fact of that matter is that for most of the pregnancy, the fetus is not really a human. For a long time it is essentially just a ball of cells. It takes many months for it to be organized to the point where it truly is a human. The reason that I think abortion should be legal, especially in the case of rape, is that I believe that the choice of the mother, the health of the mother, and the happiness of the mother are more important than the right to live of a little ball of cells. That's all this decision is, a balance of rights.Here are all the rights doing battle: The right of the mother to choose what happens to her body, the right of the mother to be healthy because pregnancies can be dangerous, the right of the mother to not have to go through the emotional stress of giving birth and having a child, and the right of the baby to live. I will agree that at a certain point in time, the right of the baby to live supersedes the mother's rights. I don't believe it is okay to kill your child the day before it would be born, it can live and think on it's own, it is a human. But for about the first two trimesters, it isn't even aware of it's own existence and it is a very simple organism totally incapable of homeostasis and during this time period, the mother's rights are more important. If you think that the rights of a ball of a few dozen cells are more important than the right of a living adult to happiness, health, and choice, then you can have your opinion and I can have mine, no one is wrong or right. I just hope you can understand that when you say no abortion at any time under any circumstances, you are saying that the rights of a tiny clump of cells are greater than the rights of a fully grown, fully sentient human."
2,"""If you think that the rights of a ball of a few dozen cells are more important than the right of a living adult to happiness, health, and choice, then you can have your opinion and I can have mine, no one is wrong or right.

1,"""I am Catholic and I believe that all human life is sacred whether it is one day old baby or an 80 year old man.""Okay first of all we are talking about laws so your religion is irrelevant don't even say the words Catholic, god, or sacred in a debate about laws or you are automatically incorrect. Just bear with me for a moment I see I have to hold your hand to get you see this.I understand you think life is really important. I agree. But let's play along with this hypothetical situation just for a moment. You are a fire fighter. You are in a burning building and you have evacuated everyone but an 80 year old feeble man and a child. You are the last fire fighter in the building and the building is moments from coming down. You know you cannot come back for a second trip. Do you choose to save one and leave the other to die?"

2,"I would carry the old man while the old man carries the baby and I'll die trying saving them both.the essence of life is not in who gets to live or who gets to die but the worth of each life both older and younger. you know what, ...it's that kind of line of thinking that brought about the the Holocaust and the killing of the lame, blind and old in Uganda and similar shameful acts around the world in different countries at different times in history when all kind of lunatic tyrants arose. nothing personal I'm just against that line of thinking. once you think one human is more important than the other when it comes to life and death, ...there is no stopping you. ...there is no limit to all kinds of wrong decisions you can make just to favor the strong and healthy and more intelligent and more able. abortion is wrong. at the moment of conception that's human life at it's weakest point if just a ball of cells, .....if that's how you'd like to put it, ....like I said you don't have the right to kill a human life just because it's hardly human. in case of rape, women are facing the hardest decisions and they need all our supports as much as we can give.but if that unborn child could talk and was shown his/her case scenario in his/her conception do you think it will be even easier for him/her. rape is the most vile disgusting way to strip a woman of her dignity and I feel for them especially when the child is growing inside of them. but it's not more the less easier for the child too. he/she did not choose to come into the world through such an act and I think if he/she grows up and learns that's how she/he was conceived, she/he will feel humiliation probably for the rest of her life but never the less she/he will need support from understanding humans surrounding. rape is an act to be completely condemned and eliminated, but we shouldn't make rash decisions when more than two lives are involved. ...."
1,"""I would carry the old man while the old man carries the baby and I'll die trying saving them both.""I didn't say baby, I said child. And I stipulated that there is no way that you can save both, you can only save one or neither. ""you know what, ...it's that kind of line of thinking that brought about the the Holocaust and the killing of the lame, blind and old in Uganda and similar shameful acts around the world in different countries at different times in history when all kind of lunatic tyrants arose.""No it is not that line of that thinking that leads to genocides. I am not saying the old man does not deserve to live. But if only one of their lives can be saved, it is better to choose the child. It's just like if you did not have enough food to feed your two kids and one of them was sickly and most likely going to die and there is no way you can get more food.A ball of cells is not a human at all. A rabbit would be closer to a human than a fetus. For most of the pregnancy the fetus is not even sentient. It does not even know it exists. It does not even have the capacity for suffering. The mother's right to choose what happens to her body is more important than the life of a ball of cells that is not even conscious."

1," Rape is an arbitrary exception; abortion must be available in all pregnancies. Many opponents of abortion allow for abortion in instances of rape. But, this assigns rights arbitrarily to the unborn ""bastard child"" as compared to an ordinarily-conceived child. It confers lower rights on the unborn ""bastard child"". This is wrong. The solution, though, cannot be to ban abortions even in cases of rape. Instead, the solution is to legalize all forms of abortion.

1,"Exactly how would you enforce such a law? Would you set up gov't intervention to pregnancy test ALL eligible females monthly? What would be the cost? Will it be a federal program or a state program? What if a woman has a miscarriage? How will they prove that. What you're all asking for is a police state in a woman's uterus. You're basically calling it Government Property. When you do these things, you violate a woman's civil rights.

2,"Okay, so how about we only allow women who are raped or impregnated against their will to have abortions?Since they are the group you seem to care so much about."
1,Well think about it... women already have abortions whey they are impregnated against their will. Isn't that the point--that they didn't intend to become pregnant?
1,"Abortion prevents victims of rape from becoming unready mothers| In cases where the rape victims cannot afford or is not ready to have a child, abortion can do both the victim and the unborn baby a favour. There are cases where school students are impregnated through rape. Pregnancy itself is a constant reminder of the sexual assault their underwent and might cause emotional instability, which will affect their studies, and subsequently their future. Moreover pregnancy might even affect the health and growth of the young girls. Besides, babies born to unready mothers are likely to be neglected or would not be able to enjoy what other children have, be it due to financial reasons or the unwillingness of the mothers to bring up the ""unwanted children"". 
"
2,"Lack of intention doesn't imply it was against their will. It just means they aren't the brightest fish in the tank.Will is want, and if you are stupid enough to have sex when you don't intend for a baby to be born you are acting against your own will.Sex is a means of procreation. If you don't want to create, then why risk it?"
1,"Intelligence and desire to have sex are two entirely different parts of the brain. One can be very stupid and have no sex drive. As can one be very smart, very horny and take all reasonable precautions (pill, condom, etc) and STILL end up pregnant. Sex is more than procreation. Other primates (and many other species) have sex for the pleasure alone. Humans have those same desires--smart or not."
2,"I agree that intelligence and desire are two different things but...Sex is pleasurable, but it is still procreation.If you are smart, you will know that birth control fails. If you are intelligent and want to have sex, but don't want a child, you will re-think the sex. What child deserves to die simply because his 'genius' mom doesn't think he should inconvenience her? It was her mistake that created him, not his. Why should he lose his life, which is his own, because he depends on her for survival but she doesn't feel like taking care of him?"
1,"The frightening thing about the abortion debate in this country is that not enough attention is brought to the fact that white men often have the strongest opinion on the matter.While I am in NO way religious, I understand that some people are religious, and that abortion goes against their beliefs. Why is it, then, that these people do not respect my views (or lack thereof) and are ffighting (sometimes violently) to make abortion illegal.Leave it up to the WOMEN who should have teh right to chose, on a completely individual basis."
1,That is a good point is the world not overpopulated already?
2,I heard someone argue that this technically makes the child the same organism as the mother; birth is more like mitosis than birth. I forget the specific justification. But it's nice to think that we're all part of the same organism.
1,I wish more people were as mature as you.
1,"Forcible impregnation.What? I thought it was funny. Fine, vote me down."
1,"Yes, abortion should be legal. First off, you'll never stop abortions, legal or not. If abortions are not legal, women and young girls will be having abortions in places such as motel rooms, back street alleys, etc., which are very unsanitary and dangerous. Also does anyone really think that the rich won't have abortions if they are made illegal? Of course they will, they'll pay top dollar to have an abortion. Lastly, it is really nobody's business what the female decides except her and her family. Pus you don't know the circumstances. Women have the right to choose, period."
1,"A fetus is not yet a child. It is the product of the woman's body despite itbeing viable future offspring. And although males have a stake in thiscreation of life they are not the ones who have to take the risks of bearingchildren. Pregnancy is a very risky situation for women and I think thepro-life camp takes this very lightly. Women are responsible for bringinglife into this world, however that responsibility falls into each and everyoneof their hands. Every woman should have the right to decide what's bestfor her health. After all it's her body and not yours."
2,"Rape does not qualify abortion; it is not the child's fault; abortion is still murder. Denying someone life because of the circumstances of their conception is unfair. They had no say in these circumstances, and were, instead, simply given life. It does not matter what the conditions of this life were. It is still wrong to kill life, particularly an unborn baby. 
"
1,"Not only do I think that it is wrong for the government or any type of law to prevent a woman from having the choice, but I also don't think that it's really the same as murder per se to abort a fetus. They're really not the same thing at all."
1,"The only real advocacy for pro-life is the thought of killing a child. It's living tissue I'll give you that, but would you have a C-section at 2 months and call it a birth? No. Because it's not truly a being yet, is it?And if you're going to make the argument that stopping a child from existing is murder, in that case, sex without procreation is murder, or for that matter, not deciding to have a child at any point is murder.The only event horizon would be life at conception. That's purely a religious claim. A conscious human being cannot be contained within 2 cells."
1,"Early-term abortions should undoubtedly be legal.I have one question for all of those who claim that abortion should be illegal because it is taking a life: If abortion becomes illegal, and a woman has an illegal abortion, what should her punishment be? Technically what she has done is murder; thus, under current laws, capital punishment would be a common solution. So, does a woman who has an abortion deserve the death penalty?"
1,"Why make this a legal debate, its a womans choice, not a congresional descussion. Why make it illegal then make women be forced into back alley abortions or worse bathtub abortions."
1,"yes, but you should have to take some sort of test saying why you want to. i have known people who got abortions bc they ""didnt want to get fat""that is not a good reason.needless to say, i dont talk to that person now."
1,however it is terrible to say abortion should be legal . if it is made illegal than women will do unsafe things to themselves not to have a kid . such as get a friend to push her down the stairs
1,Agreed. And these homemade abortions are not always successful and thus do not harm just the mothers but also the children.
1,"This is obviously a difficult decision to make, and one I have thought out carefully prior to coming to an opinion. I think, to paraphrase Obama, that expectant mothers are the best people to make the choices about whether or not they are financially and emotionally stable enough to care for a child. The world is overpopulated as it is. Humans continue to grow at a rate that is unsustainable, and at some point nature will regulate us through some mass disaster/disease. Until then, however, abortion at least offers a little self regulation of population growth."
1,"i believe that it is wrong but that i also think that it should be legal because some people don't have any control over getting pregnant because of rape. and they just are not ready to have a child because or age, finances or both. it also needs to be legal because women and or men will take it into their own hands and do it themselves therefore inflicting damage upon themselves as well possibly permanent damage. and maybe even death to the mother. abortions have to be legal or all hell will break loose and the death rate will increase substantially"
1,frist of you can only have an abortion if the fetus is at least 28 days old in the stomic of course but its not takeing any human life it would braly have been growing outof the egg so yes it ahould be legal but only for 17 and below people
2,"A rape victim can put their baby up for adoption. Why can't a rape victim put their child up for adoption? Isn't this an adequate resolution to the problem? The only reason it might not be an adequate resolution are the risks and pains of child-birth and perhaps the difficulty of separating from the child. But, these objections are easily dealt with. First, maintaining the life of a fetus is worth the pains and risks that it might cause the mother. Second, there is no difference in separating from an unborn child (abortion) as compared to a born child (adoption).

2,"Do you have a informed conscious mind? Where you once a fetus? I am going to assume that both of those answers is yes, thus it matters little whether a fetus is conscious, merely that if allowed to grow and develop it will have a conscious mind, but if an abortion is carried out that life will never be given a chance to develop. Just imagine what this world would be like if Jonas Salk, or Sir Isaac Newton, or Albert Einstein, or Abraham Lincoln, or George Washington, or Thomas Jefferson had been aborted as children. It's hard to imagine what the world would be like."
1,"Yes but we don't know if that unborn life could become somebody like Albert Einstein etc but it also could become a Hitler, osama bin laden and countless others. It's chance, we don't know who the unborn will become. Government should not place restrictions on what a female can do with to her body, because of a chance. Many people die before they have a chance to become somebody like Albert Einstein yet the evidence of their path is there to see, but the government and others don't worry about trying to preserve their life, just the life of a chance which could go any number of ways."
2,"If you take that view, then we should abort every baby because one in a billion might have the charisma, insanity and happen to be in a desperate country whose economic power has been crippled through exploitation by the ""free world."" By your reasoning none of us should have been born because of the ""chance"" we might turn out bad."
1,"I'm not saying that we should abort babies because one of them might become like Hitler or Stalin or someone else bad, i'm just saying that if you are gonna use the argument that not aborting a baby might produce a genius then you have to take into account that not aborting that baby could also produce a very evil person. It goes both ways. of course i'm not saying my reasoning would require that every baby be killed, i believe the woman has the final choice so i couldn't decide if the baby is aborted or not i could just suggest."

1,Abortion doesn't kill a baby because it's not a baby. It's an inviable parasite. It cannot eat or breathe on its own without the host (woman) so it is not its own entity. Therefore abortion removes an unwanted growth. If the fetus were a person than every miscarriage would be a murder and Mother Nature causes miscarriages in 20-45 percent of pregnancies. Are you going to accuse Mother Nature of killing babies? Or the host (woman)? I think not. It's not a baby. It's a bunch of cells.

Those opposed to any type of induced abortion have no idea what its like for a child to carry the burden of being the offspring of abuse. It is a fact that unplanned/unwanted children are more likely to be subjected to abuse and neglect--continuing the cycle. Stopping that cycle of abuse is easy. It just takes one outpatient appointment."
2,"Look at it this way: should a human life suffer because of the mistakes of their parents? I mean, you're saying a human shouldn't suffer death because the parents conceived the child against their wills. My issue is, a) a fetus isn't a human and I have a hard time with people comparing fetus's to a newborn with a brain. b) The consequences of those parens having a child when they can't even afford to take care of it, not just financially, but probably mentally and emotionally, only leads for that child, with feelings, and a current life, to suffer. I think they're two totally different things: fetus vs child. I understand the empathatic thoughts of abortion, but I believe it hurts a hell of a lot more seeing kids abused and abandoned than it does to see a fetus aborted."
2,Abortion should not be legal because if we could just get rid of abortion we could get save some of our and your tax dollars that pay for abortion and plus seeing as my tax dollars pay for someone to have an abortion or murder the child its like im helping the person kill the child as are all of us medical neccesity is fine but as far as im concerned i dont think i should have to pay for someone to kill their kid
2,"Abortion is the killing of a child. No one should be willfully killed, be it at 1 week or 100 years. When I had my first ultrasound with my son, I was 5 weeks pregnant, which means I had become pregnant 3 weeks prior. My son had a heartbeat. How can anyone anyone anyone stop a beating heart on purpose? Your decision should happen BEFORE you find yourself in this position. If it is ok to abort, why do those who do so end up so destroyed for the rest of their lives? It's because they know they killed a human and that will rest on their hearts for life. If only their child had such an opportunity. For those of you who wrote that there is no God, and were angered by such a defense, I will pray for you. Because without faith, you really have nothing."
1,"""If it is ok to abort, why do those who do so end up so destroyed for the rest of their lives?""They don't. Not if they do it for the right reasons. There is always the ""what if"" factor.

About half of women in the US who have had an abortion already have children, so they know the joys and stresses of children. They make the decision for the greater good--the family and society."

2,"Personally, I don't think abortion should be allowed anywhere. Abortion is a cruel way to get rid of a child. The mother always has choices readily available to them, and many hospitals have programs that give unwanted babies to good homes. I think that for those who consider an abortion, they shouldn't have opened their legs in the first place, whether the guy was wearing a glove or not. Unless there was a life-or-death situation where the mother could die with a c-section or die having a baby. then it's appropriate."
2,"Abortion is murder no matter when a person believes life becomes official. This controversy will remain for centuries, however the fact that a potential life has ended before given a chance remains evidence enough for most people to understand why a person should never have a choice of whether a baby lives or dies. There are many reasons abortion should be illegal including the descriptive and disturbing stories about how aborted babies sometime scream as they come out and the looks of pain on their faces. These facts alone should convince anyone to eliminate the idea of pregnancy termination out of their mind. The health threat to the mother after going through with the procedure as well as the lifelong health risks that remain should be good enough reasons abortion should be illegal. With the rising healthcare costs and instance of disease greater than the medical ability to solve the problems, continued health remains important to all people. Self induced problems such as voluntary termination of pregnancy leads to complications for future pregnancies, reproductive disease, and depression. Understanding that abortion is murder aids a woman in making healthy decisions for baby and mother. Though a mother may not want her baby, health for both remains and adoption remains a viable option. God chooses many couples to be available for adopting these children by way of impotence by one or both people. Bottom line, was sex made for reproduction? Yes. Can you say abortion is natural? No"

1," It is odd to defend the dignity of a fetus over a child-rearer There is a peculiar double standard being applied by opponents of abortion. The dignity of the fetus is glorified, while the dignity of the child-rearer is seemingly ignored and even trampled.

2,"It seems to me that both sides of this topic tend to be unreasonable. Many pro-lifers go so far as to assert that the morning after pill is murder, which is ludicrous. On the other hand, some pro-choice groups don't want any restrictions on abortion, which is equally ludicrous. I am trying to have an open mind, so my question for the pro-choice group is, should there be any restrictions on abortion at all? Should we (the people) allow a woman to decide she doesn't want her child as it is coming down the birth canal at 9 months?"

As a mother, I know how much joy my son has brought me...and believe me - if there is a woman out there that doesn't want their child - there are equally as many women out there that are dying to have one.

2,"Unborn babies are living things and when you kill them, it is the same thing as killing an adult or a child. God is the creator of life and when you kill unborn babies you are destroying his creations. In the beginning God created Adam by breathing the breath of life into his nostrils. “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.” Psalm 139:13. Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides. If somebody did this they would be breaking the fifth commandment: You shall not murder. He or she is also breaking the first commandment : You shall have no other gods.

Let’s take a trip back to biology class; the male sperm unites with a female gamete to form a single cell called a zygote. So basically when the sperm and egg unite they then create a unique DNA of a human being. Only a small percentage of abortions are done due to rape and medical circumstances. A recent studied showed that women who were raped and had an abortion had a harder time healing than those who chose to have their babies. Since when is it expectable to punish a child for their father’s crimes?Just because you may be adopted does not mean you’ll have a miserable unsuccessful life. Did you know that Faith Hill, Jamie Foxx, and Babe Ruth were adopted? Abortion is done for mere convenience. Many women don’t know the true facts of abortion until it is to late and often feel depression, guilt, isolation, insomnia or nightmares, and much more after it is done.

1,"All abortions no matter when they occur are very sad affairs. It is really sad when circumstances have come together such that a life must be ended or stopped from coming to fruition. Abortions are very emotionally trying to mothers and their families. That said, abortions are completely and absolutely necessary even late term abortions. I am going to argue this from a few angles.If a woman wants to terminate her pregnancy bad enough, she will do so regardless of whether she has to go to a clinic or get one from an unlicensed back alley ""doctor"" or perform one herself. Before Roe v. Wade thousands of women died every year from complications from these abortions. By allowing abortions and late-term abortions to be legal, we allow women to go through safe and regulated channels to do something they are going to do anyway to be frank.There are many circumstances in which late-term abortions are quite necessary, but I'll just name a few common situations. Often when young girls are raped, they will not tell anyone because they are afraid or a multitude of other reasons. Sometimes no one knows these girls are pregnant until they start getting big in their third trimester. These girls never got a chance to abort the rape-child in the ""proper"" time window because they are too afraid or immature to tell anyone or they don't even understand what pregnancy or sex is. Is it really fair to force an 11 year old girl to give birth to the child of her rapist because she didn't want to tell anyone she was raped?Another situation is sometimes mothers are diagnosed with cancer late in their pregnancies beyond the date of normal abortions. These women often need chemotherapy or radiation therapy. This is an excerpt from the abstract of a paper by the Department of Radiology at the University of Iowa College of Medicine""Malignant disease requiring radiation therapy during pregnancy presents an enormous challenge for the clinician. The optimal radiotherapeutic management of the patient and the optimal management of the pregnancy involve directly opposing demands. Ionizing radiation should be avoided during pregnancy whenever possible. Doses in excess of 0.1 Gy (10 rad) delivered during gestation have been associated with various detrimental effects, and therapeutic abortion has been recommended.""Often the cancer is so fast spreading that to wait the duration of the pregnancy to administer treatment that will most likely kill or maim the fetus is very dangerous and possibly fatal for the mother. In these situations the most humane thing to do is to terminate the pregnancy and treat the mother.My last hypothetical is that sometimes it is not apparent until late in the pregnancy that the baby has life-threatening deformities that threaten the mother as well. Is it really fair to tell a mother she must risk her life to give birth to baby that will or likely will die?As you can see there are multitude of possible situations in which a late-term abortion is the best option. There are such diverse situations that can occur and they are so sensitive and dependent on context, that this is not an issue that is done proper service by a blanket rule by politicians. These decisions are best left up to doctors and their patients. Women who want late-term abortions should ask their doctors and if their doctors agree that a late-term abortion is the best medical option, they should seek the approval of other doctors. Furthermore all of these decisions should be overseen by a governing board of doctors.Late-term abortions are not used because mothers changed their mind or procrastinated and this is not the intended use. Like I said the decision should be up to the discretion of doctors to determine the necessity of the procedure."
1,"I agree with all the above. Abortion is a personal issue and i'm certain women don't choose it lightly for a multitude of reasons. But it remains a personal issue, that only the woman and her doctor can truly understand. Since almost every circumstance is unique no specific rule can be fairly applied that would limit against abortion. The forces that are against abortion do not speak for all of society nor does all of society believe or follow the full teachings of those forces and thus society shouldn't be constrained by rules and regulations that only that select force supports. A woman should not be forced to risk a great deterioration of her health, living standard, or life because some group of people believe that abortions are morally wrong. If she is forced to be obligated by this select group then how is she a free person?"
2,"I agree in the cases of severe health dangers to the child and/or mother, abortion can be the best option. But as far as the rape situation, I've gone back and forth a bit thinking about it...and I just don't think that it can justify taking a human life, As horrid as that situation is. The fact that women will get illegal abortions is really not a sufficient reason to make it legal, unless there is proof that just as many abortions will occur either way. Abortion, in my opinion, is taking a human life. Should we really make that legal?"
1,"Late-term abortion is something that should be avoided at all costs, and I've been hearing a lot about it lately, mainly from people who were told that they should have one by doctors because their children may have down's syndrome (everyone that was told this didn't have further testing done because of the risk of killing the child (50% chance), and all were born and found to be healthy).It's something that should be taken care of before the child develops, but if it comes down to deciding later, it should still be up to the parents who created the child... It's sad, yes, but it's not our responsibility to decide who has to have children and who doesn't. Not everyone is happily married and ready, mentally, physically, or finically, to have children when they become pregnant, and we don't have the resources and in most respects, the right, to decide for people. I believe that this is the true conservative stance on this issue. Limited government, more freedom and leave the moral decision to be made by the moral beings who are responsible for the child, not the government."
2,Late-term abortions should not be legal because the baby is viable outside of the mother and is alive. Anyway the mother has come so far why should she change her mind and have an abortion when she could give the baby up for adoption in a month or two.
2,"If the baby endangers the mother's life, then yes, a late-term abortion is justified. Other than that, absolutely not. I don't care if your baby is going to have down syndrome or will be missing a limb or organ! That baby is a human by almost any body's standards and aborting it at that point would surely be murder! I don't like abortion at any point, but getting one that late most likely means that the mother does not want the baby because it will have a defect. If this is the case, that woman should not even be trying to have a child because she is an immoral and selfish person."
1,"As is normal for pro-lifers, and by no means your fault because it is what is propogated in media and by word of mouth,You misunderstand the situation when it comes to deformities in late term abortions.You have to understand, that in the entire US, population something like half a billion, think about that number for a second, there are, sorry were, 3 late-term abortion doctors.3.Cases of downsyndrome, and other minor deformities or retardations do not make it to these doctors, it would be impossibe for them to make it to these doctors with the tens of thousands of minorly retarded or deformed humans born in this country on a daily basis.These children are born, given life, and hopefully cared for, the ones you seem to think were being aborted. Doctors do not, and do not want to for the most part, perform late-term abortions in these cases.In order for a deformity or retardation to be judged by these doctors to be morally just to abort, it has to be something like, and I'm getting the name wrong, but something like I think Manchester Disease... damn, can't think of the name, but it's a disease where literally the DNA is messed up, the child will be born if taken full term, but will die within an hour or so of birth, often the mother's life is in danger as well. Meanwhile in that hour, the child will be in tremendous and unrelievable pain. Doctors know they will be in pain, there will not be a moment of joy, and in their entire and short existance they will only know pain most cannot even imagine. They may literally have eyes on their feet, nothing will be right, but they're put together just well enough for the organs to support life for a very short time outside of the mother.It's cruel cosmic joke that these things happen, but it's important to realize they do, and not turn a blind eye to these poor souls who are cursed in such a manner.These diseases are common among victims of incest, not so much the general public,but they do exist, and we have the moral obligation I think to save them from this miserable existance, and the mother of the child from potential death from complications.These are the kind of deformities that make it to these ""baby killers""and not the kind you are thinking of. I think one would have to be a real sadist, or just completely lacking common sense and empathy, to not realize that in these cases of deformity, abortion is the only moral option.How can one let a living thing suffer like that? And how can one believe their god, whatever god they follow, would judge someone for taking such mercy?No, the only explanation I can think of is that people are woefully misinformed about the individual circumstances that has lead these poor girls to these doctors, and it's important people learn so that hopefully more of these doctors are not killed."
1,"Thanks for the good argument. ""No, the only explanation I can think of is that people are woefully misinformed about the individual circumstances that has lead these poor girls to these doctors, and it's important people learn so that hopefully more of these doctors are not killed.""You're definitely right that we have to educate people that the few late-term abortion doctors are not simply baby killers, but are actually really courageous people who are helping people. They knowingly risk their lives to help ensure women who need late-term abortions can get them. For everyone who thinks that abortion doctors are simply evil baby killers, please read this article by an abortion doctor on why he performs abortions despite two attempts on his life.http://www.nationalpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=283931"
1,You can see then how this is a decision best left up to doctors not politicians right?
2," Abortion opens the door to the sexual exploitation of women The existence of abortion gives men a little more of a safeguard against unintentionally impregnating a woman. As a result, men will be more aggressive in their sexual exploitation of women.
"
2,"Late-term abortion is essentially giving birth and chucking the child, since modern technology allows infants to live much earlier outside the womb than nine months. If the mother is endangered, late-term abortion may be acceptable, but otherwise, that seems wrong."
2,Any abortions should not be aloud if you are stupid enough to get pregnant when you don't want a baby or selfish enough not to want to look after it when you find out it may have an illness then it is your own fault why should the life of an innocent unborn child be killed because of your mistake?
1,"I agree that abortion is wrong, and I agree that for the most part it shouldn't be allowed. But you're over-simplifying the issue. Unwanted pregnancies are not always due to stupidity(some people are raped), and not all abortions are out of selfishness. Read Iamdavid's post, if you haven't already. This is an extremely rare case, of course, but it is important to acknowledge and consider these kinds of things when deciding on this issue."
2,"There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it? If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life. I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being. The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.Roe vs Wade was a very poor decision by the Supreme Court because it introduce a major contradiction in the law. The unjustified taking of a human life is considered murder under current law and we have different degrees to further define it. Consider the fact that if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide. But if a doctor kills only one of those persons; no charge. The Supreme Court by their ruling overturned the law they were supposed to uphold. The right thing to do would be to overturn this erroneous ruling and restore our rule of law."
2,"Brilliant. That's it. Abortion is WRONG, and I don't know why some people can't get it through their thick skulls. Hmmm if you were a baby and were going to be born and you were aborted, you probably would care."
1,"""I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.""So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby? I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted. Surely that is justification enough? That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned. There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become. Where would they get the money to look after so many children? Our taxes? It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous. But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion. Also, when do you begin to class a fetus as a human? I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks. It doesnt even enter the fetal stage untill the 11th week, surely abortion before this stage is not inhumane? If there was a contraception out there that was 100% effective, then this would be a more valid arguement. I'm young, and have dreams and aspirations that I could never fulfill if I became pregnant. If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one. You're view seems to be very black and white, and you seem to dismiss the huge grey area that exists. Abortion exists for a reason and should not be banned"
2,"To your first point:What you are arguing for is the view known in German as; Lebensunwertes Leben or The Life Unworthy of Life. This was the philosophy that drove the Holocaust of Nazi Germany and the one currently underway here in America. To learn more about this follow this link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_unworthy_of_life Why do I say this? Because you take a class of humans and then give reasons ( very poor ones) of why they should not be allowed to live.In Nazi Germany they said; This human should not live because of X. And you say that this human should not live because of X. There is a direct correlation here and I hope you see it. When you get a chance also pick up the book  From Darwin to Hitler by Dr. Richard WeikartNow to your question of when do you begin to class a fetus as a human?At the moment of conception. Because at that point you now have a complete and distinct human DNA in the cell. There is no way around this; humans produce humans and dogs produce dogs. About a contraception that is 100% effective every time. It's known as abstinence. Practice it faithfully and you will never get pregnant or an STD. Fail to practice it and pay the price with your life and possibly that of your child's. And if you do have an unwanted pregnancy, Please consider adoption. Did you know that 1 out of every 6 couples are infertile. Do the math, that's a lot of couples who want to have children and can't. And I'm one of them. It cost me 14,000 dollars to have my daughter and it tears me up inside to know that some parents just discard their children like trash. There are thousands of us out here who are screaming; please don't kill it, we'll take it. You'd also be surprised to know the high number of Americans who adopt from over seas; and why do they? There aren't enough children to be adopted here because of abortion.You noted well that I see this issue as black and white. It's called moral clarity. When looking at evil I call it as it is; evil. Final thought: Were you ever a fetus? Because if you were, Then you have to acknowledge that if your mother would have had an abortion it would have ended your life, not something else, but your life. Think about that and look at it real hard because that's what abortion does; it ends the life of a human being in the early stages of development.And if you were born after 1972, I challenge you to consider yourself a Survivor of the Abortion Holocaust. 1/3 of your generation has been killed by abortion in America! http://www.survivors.la/"
1,attn Jstantall:so why did Bush change the law when he had a Republican Congress and receptive Federal judges ???you can't blame this on limp Democrats or socialist liberals
2,"Well, if you have a lame duck congress who stonewalls him on everything; I think it would be reasonable to blame them.But that's not the question at hand is it? The question is; what is being killed in an abortion? that's the only one that matters."
1,"is Bush # 43 ancient history?during his eight years, he had a Republican controlled Congress that was NOT in a lame duck statuseven when it was so-called lame duck, are yah telling me that the Republicans would have voted against Bush administration abortion restrictions ?they had the 50+% Congressinal majority and could have forced a Senate filibuster debatebut i suspect that the Republican leadership primarily give the anti-abortionist lip service"
2,"  Rejecting abortion and going through with pregnancies empowers women Patricia Heaton, Emmy-winning actress, Washington Times, (April 14, 2005) - ""The early feminists found abortion to be the ultimate exploitation of women. [Women had to] become men to compete. We bought into that. We're smarter today. It's more empowering to go through with your pregnancy.""[26]

2,"FYIThe question is not who did or didn't do this or that. The question is should abortion be banned. I say it already is. We already have laws against murder; it's just that Roe vs Wade made a loop hole in the law and that ought to scare the hell out of any sane individual. Because with that ruling a whole class of people just became non persons and no longer protected under the Constitution. Abortion is the unjustified taking of a human life in the early stages of development and that is wrong. And if it is within in your power to stop it and you don't; you are just as guilty, regardless of your political affiliation."
2,"I agree, go back and look at the record of Congress under Bush; it's record is shameful. If Bush couldn't get appointees even voted on; How could he possible address such a controversial subject as abortion?"
1,"... okay, I just looked at it.So what exactly did Bush want that he didn't get? I see nothing here... including that bs war in Iraq, the unconstitutional ""Patriot"" Act, and that 900 billion dollar tax cut that didn't do jack to help the economy.That's not really the point though.This is about abortion,go ahead, try and make it illegal.The world has been through this a dozen times, and for hundreds of years.Illegal Abortions prevent 0 abortions from happening, and kills woman that have to go to basements and the homes of people who may or may not be doctors to get the procedure, and who often die as a result.Amen right man ._."
2,"I would rather lose a handful of women occasionally through botched abortions than sacrifice on average 1500 children daily to save those women.  If perfection is your standard for law then you are correct, however laws were meant to restrain. And prior to Roe vs Wade the law against abortion did that quite well, perfection? No. Made it rare? most certainly. And what happened after Roe vs Wade? abortions went through the roof. Laws are meant to keep us from killing ourselves off but Roe vs Wade does the opposite. it sanctions it. Consider Europe, within a hundred years, if not sooner, Europeans will cease to exist as a unique people group. Why? Zero Population growth. They're not reproducing and when they do, they kill it. Europe will be a Muslim nation within our lifetime, Why? They're having families. So please tell me why we should follow the Europeans into extinction?"
1,"1. duh, the point is these woman are going to have an abortion whether it's banned or not. So either the cluster of cells is removed and the woman lives. Or the cluster of cells is removed and the woman dies. Either way, abortion being banned has never in human history stopped people from getting abortions.2. No, it didn't make it rare, that's the point. Banning abortion doesn't stop it, it just hides it and demonizes woman, who many times are only children at the time, and who many times were raped. And you wonder why no one likes talking hardcore Christians about this kind of thing.3. wtf? have you been reading the white supremacist newsletter again? Europe's population is doing just fine. And there's nothing wrong in and of itself if they do end up having more muslims than whatever they have now. Who cares? Why's it your business what someone else does?And who the fuck is ""we"" you arrogant ass. The US does not have a ""we"" we're supposed to be founded on the idea of diversity and freedom. I find this entire post incredibly offensive, and you get a rare downvote from me."
2,You said 'who many times were raped'I say ONLY 1% OF ALL ABORTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE BECAUSE THE PREGNANCY IS THE RESULT OF RAPE OR INCEST!!!!! I have posted this many times.What would you say if a court ruling said that a child is not a human being until the age of 15? The murder rate of children would INCREASE. The abortion numbers INCREASED AFTER Roe v. Wade. The numbers would DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY if abortion was illegal.
2,"I am pro-life.I am a faithful Christian.I have five younger siblings. The two youngest I remember their life clearly. I want you to look at a one day old baby, look at her fingers, toes, face, legs, watch her breathe, and watch her interact with people and tell she was not a human being in the womb.I want you to watch a 2 year old play with her baby sister and tell me that the baby was not a human being in the womb.I want you to look at a one day old baby, look at her fingers, toes, face, legs, watch her breathe, and watch her interact with people and tell she was not a human being in the womb.If you can do either of these, I will be astounded about how emotionless you are. And I will pray that some day abortion is illegal."
1,"I've seen these videos. If it's not self-aware it's not a human yet, no matter what it looks like.You're talking about you're feelings and what you believe because you're a typical self-righteous self-involved christian completely incapable of understanding that what you think and feel is not what everyone else thinks and feels.The laws put in place on abortion take into account what science finds to be truenot how you feel helliom or what you think some invisible daddy in the sky wants you to feel.Abortion is illegal after the third trimester except in extreme circumstances. Before then it's not a human yet, it's the specific woman's body and not yours, and it's none of your business.That's how it is and that's how it should be,no matter how many of you right wing nuts highjack this site and serial downvote us sane and logical participants on the site."

Does that mean we can dump them if we change our minds?""...Abortion is illegal after the third trimester except in extreme circumstances""Not exactly true. There are states, and forgive me for not remembering right off the top of my head which ones, that allow abortion ""up to the moment of birth""I will see if I can find that one.""...no matter how many of you right wing nuts high jack this site and serial down vote us sane and logical participants on the site.""Now thats disappointing.

1," Abortions are mostly sought when birth control fails Clayton H. McCracken, director of Inter Mountain Planned Parenthood, Fall 2000 - ""Most of the patients come to our abortion clinic as a result of failure of a birth control method, or a failure of our system to provide birth control.""[27]  
"
1,"great ._.1. Who's worried about trees? It just doesn't make sense to cut all of them down without planting new ones, since then all humans would die, born or not.2. Um, kids are self-aware, they just don't develop empathy until sometime after birth. But a new born has feelings, knows when it's hungry, etc. Therefore it's wrong to throw them in dumpsters.3. True, and it's state to state. But even the states that do allow it up to birth, again it is only in extreme circumstances. If I'm a woman in any state and I'm due in a week, and my life is not in danger, and I'm not a child myself and I wasn't raped by my dad or something, then abortion is not an option. And I'm fine with that actually, I think it's the right law.4. About 2 or 3 months ago I'd say 5 right wing nuts showed up here and downvoted nearly every argument I've ever made in my over a year on this site. It's why I don't show up as often.If someone wants to disagree fine, but use facts and logic. I'm tired of having the Bible quoted at me, responses rife with logical fallacies, responses that didn't bother to read what I wrote, and those who need to announce their faith before making an argument when their faith has 0 to do with the argument. I never downvote or insult anyone just because I disagree, I do so when they act like a moron, whether I agree with them or not."
2,"1. The argument I was trying to make is that the Left seems to be more concerned about saving trees than they are HUMAN BEINGS. Thats another ""debate"" I guess.2. OK not an argument here but I would appreciate some clarification...is it empathy or self awareness we are waiting for before we call them human? The reason I am asking is because it was my experience with my son that he almost immediately could sense his mothers emotional state and reacted in kind. He recognized both my wife's and my voice and music that he heard while in the womb.3. I somewhat agree on this one in that if the birth risks the life of both the mother and the baby then there is no choice. I will admit I would anguish over a decision like that for the rest of my life.As far as rape goes...while it is certainly not the fault of the mother that it happened to her it is also not the fault of the child.4. I understand that but remember ""when your enemy makes you angry ...they win"" Someone really smart and famous said that but for the life of me I cant recall who.Try not to forget that ""facts"" and ""logic"" vary according to each individuals viewpoint and at times, can be subjective both on the right and the left. They are as tired of you quoting science that they dont believe in as your are of them using a book that you dont believe in. Both groups have absolute belief in their sources.If they are ""right wing nuts"" let them be....wont that just about make your argument for you? Dad always said that we catch more flies with honey than we do vinegar!"
1,"1. The left is generally anti-war, pro healthcare, pro helping starving people in Africa, etc, all of which saves lives. Since I don't consider a fetus a life, from my standpoint the right is more concerned with vague moral standards only shared by the right than saving lives, but whatever.2. I'm talking about self-awareness, as in feelings. A fetus before the third trimester has 0 capacity to feel. They're not sad about being aborted, it doesn't hurt them, they don't have these human emotions yet. This is what I'm talking about. That an already born child likes its mom in no way invalidates this point.3. And here is the disconnect, you are absolutely correct. But the leap so many on the right are not willing to make is that abortion is always something to anguish over. Sure, there are bitches (and I don't use that term lightly) who simply don't care. But the vast vast vast majority of abortions are performed by women who feel they simply have no choice. It is not a party. But it's their choice, something they have to live with. Not the right wing, not you personally, just her, no one else's business. The only thing making abortions illegal would change is the number of mothers who die with the child. That's all it changes no matter how pretty this anti-abortion idea that ""if we just shove what we really really really feel down everyone's throat everyone will live happily ever after, amen"" - that's not how it works. Woman have been having abortions one way or another, legal or illegal, since the beginning of time.As for your point about rape. It's not the fault of the ""child"" only because the ""child"" doesn't exist. It's a cluster of cells and if she wants to abort it it's her choice, again, not yours.4. facts and logic never vary. People are wrong about facts and logic, but in and of themselves, they are constant. It is a fact the earth is round for example. Some have the ""opinion"" it is not, but this is not an opinion, this is simply wrong. There is a fact at the bottom of when a fetus becomes self-aware, people who study biology for a decade before becoming a doctor believe this to be around the 3rd trimester. Whatever the answer really is, I trust the dude who studied it for a decade over people who think they speak in tongues and give their live savings to Jerry Falwell. Is the exact moment as definite as the shape of the earth? No, probably not. But it's not that big a mystery, and while a valid opinion may vary by a month or so of when this elusive self-awareness begins, it most certainly is not upon conception, or even 2 or 3 months later. It's akin at that point to saying the earth has to be flat because when I stand on my roof I can't see it curve.Here's the difference between an argument with two different opinions, and the abortion debate.Indulge me, I enjoy coming up with analogies.2 people are walking through a forest. 1 wants to go left, the other right. The one who wants to go right says they both have to go right. The one who wants to go left says his friend can go right if he likes, but for himself, he thinks he should be able to choose.That's the gist of it. It's not a matter of two sides fighting about what everyone should do. It's about one side trying to force everyone to do something they may or may not want to and the other saying since we really don't know where either leads, people should have the choice."

It might take another case challenging this ruling and it's constitutionality.

1,"There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it?There are more questions than that.. sorryIf it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life.So you admit that there are some cases where it is justifiable. The next question then is who gets to decide? Should it be society at large via established government institutions or should it be a private matter left to the sovereignty of the family unit and those health care professionals they consult?"
1," Abortion is just when birth control fails (involuntary impregnation) If a woman does not voluntarily choose to seek a pregnancy, it is impossible for a fetus to have any claim over the woman's body. Only when the woman participates voluntarily in creating a life, does she open the door to any responsibilities to the fetus or to any rights that the fetus may have over the mother. If a pregnancy is a result of an accident (the failure of birth control), it cannot be called voluntary. Therefore, the fetus cannot be said to have any rights over the mother's body, and abortion can be said to be justified.
"
2,"Let me clarify my position, since I misstated it. The first question that needs to be asked is "" what kind of life is it?"" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate. Therefore no further questions are needed.I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union.But isn't that just like human nature, everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire. Then laws get broke, peace treaties ignored, property taken and people killed. But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves. When we call evil, good. We may be guiltless before the law but that doesn't mean we are not without real quilt. But praise be to God that He has provided a solution to the two greatest problems man faces, guilt and death. With God there is forgiveness, but not without great cost."
1,"Since I disagree with you so often I will snip out some portions of what you typed that I do agree with:I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual unionthe most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves. When we call evil, good.See I don't disagree with you completely."
1,"The first question that needs to be asked is "" what kind of life is it?"" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate. Therefore no further questions are needed.That is an example of what is called jumping to conclusions. You have not established that it abortion is never justified. Even if it is agreed (which I do agree with you) that it is a human life."
1,"Ok let me clarify,But let me say I'm not sure why you are pushing this point, but my guess is that it has something to do with authority and you want to make a point about that.So let me modify what I said; the reasons commonly given for abortions are in adequate. In the case that the mothers life is endangered, it should be the case that the attending physician should make every attempt and exhaust every means possible to save the life of mother and child, Abortion should never be considered as an easy out, quick fix or money saving option, But if it comes down to it, I think every mother would lay down their lives for their children, it's the most humane thing to do and the most loving; to lay down your life on behalf of someone else. So even in this case I would still maintain that it should not be an option and I think it would be hard to give an adequate reason why the child's life should be taken and not the mothers. I think this maintains the sanctity of the child's life throughout and at this point the moral dilemma moves from the child into other areas. And the Husband and Wife should make the call, if circumstances necessitate it."
2,"I'd like to take the time to address several tings that have been raised in this debate and clarify my argument against abortion.First, the affect this debate has on women who have had abortions. This reality has weighed heavily on my conscience. But I think a greater issue is at stake here and therefore the cost is worth it. The greater good that is being served here is the hope that abortion on demand might someday be ended and that the emotional trauma it causes to women will be ended also.The holocaust of abortion will not be ended until people see and know the reality of what it is. It has been stunning to see through the course of this debate the lengths people will go to so as to sugar coat this issue and make it appear not so bad; and actually justifiable. So my effort is to make that know as best I can. But the truth is that when women, who have had abortions, come to a correct understanding of what has happened there is real pain and real quilt; and that certainly is not to be dismissed. So for those who have had abortions I say there is a way out of the pain and quilt; true forgiveness is possible. There is only one way out and that is through the great exchange; God in Christ takes your life and He gives you His. When He died, you died and the charges against you are paid in full, the debt is canceled. Then the life of perfection He lived becomes yours; it is laid to your account. So you go from an infinity negative debt to an infinity positive righteousness. And through His resurrection you are raised to newness of life.This is only possible through repentance and faith. Confess your sins and trust God to do for you what he said He would in Christ. This faith is not a leap in the dark, like crossing your fingers. It is an active trust, like standing on solid ground; a confident expectation in the faithfulness of God.With that said I would like to clarify my argument against abortion further and answer the question should abortion be banned. But let me preface my argument with a disclaimer. I realize there is a difference between proof and persuasion. There is no argument that I can put forth that can't be disputed. There are actually people who will argue for the reality of square circles. So I put this argument forth for those who are truly open-minded; in hopes you will be persuaded.The taking of the life of an innocent human being without proper justification is murder and murder is illegal.Abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification. therefore it is murder and should be illegal"
2,I should further say to disprove this argument you have to falsify it's key premise and that is: abortion takes the life of an innocent human being That' why this whole debate hinges on one key question: What is it? And genetically it is human. It has it's own unique and complete chromosome which makes it distinct from it's parents and wholly different from the egg and sperm used to create it. Since this syllogism is sound and it's premises are verifiable you will have to resort to irrationality and unscientific assertions to disprove it.
1,"I will take the bait for fun.I assume (unless you refute it explicitly) you agree that there are somecases where abortion is merited or ""medically necessary""Who is the proper authority for determining medical necessity?expected answer from you (according to the way I think you think):GovernmentAnswer I would give: The doctor and those consulted by the pregnant woman.Abortion is not banned. The murder of the unborn is illegal and punishable as murder. Abortion is not murder if you admit that it is ever done by medical necessity and without malicious intent.since this argument is flawless, all who disagree are just plain old sloppy thinkers ~sarcastic snicker"
2,"No, I disagree.There is no right time to have an abortion."
1,"OK agreed you have to establish intent. However, all abortions are premeditated, what say you? Your assumption of my answer would be false, see my other response for the answer.However to your point,you plain old sloppy thinker you, My qualification was: without proper justification and in this case it could be argued as proper justification.However, the point of my syllogism was to highlight the importance of the question: what kind of life is it your objection highlights the point more becuse there would be no moral dilemma if it was a chicken."
2,"During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945. These people include Jews, homosexuals, Slavics (Russians, Poles, and others), Gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Christians found helping the targeted people. That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers. But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers? From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed. This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust. For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.4 million babies each year. The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year. The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves. Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children. To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?The subject of abortion and the Holocaust are very closely related subjects. The Jews were killed because they were unwanted and inconvenient. A child is aborted because they are unwanted and inconvenient. I want you to tell me the Holocaust was wrong and then tell me abortion is okay. You just can't do that. One can't be wrong and the other right. That is like saying rape is wrong but incest is okay."
2," Abortion is wrongly sought as an alternative form of birth control Kristin Luker, Taking Chances: Abortion and the Decision Not to Contracept (1975) - ""In short, there are no empirical grounds for assuming that women have an à priori preference for contraception over abortion.""[28] In other words, women see abortion as a suitable alternative to birth control. 
"
2,"come to think of it...Many childern have been killed due to abortion.But if you had given them a chance to live, then they would have proved worthwhile to live!Just think how many masterminds have been killed before birth?If they had lived, may be they would have made their world a peaceful heaven!!"
2,"I would just like to add one more thing. Everyone who is for abortion seems to insist this should solely be the woman's decision. Why is that? What about the father? Why should he have no say in a child that he would have to bear legal responsibility to if it were born?Suppose, a father says he does not want the child and she has it anyway. He is still legally liable to this child. Now, suppose the opposite. He wants the child, is willing to raise this child without any financial support from the mother and is willing to bear all financial burden of the mother while she is unable to work. He should not have this right?"
2,"Abortion should definetly be banned! Their is a lot of things to prevent pregnancies such as condoms, birth control and getting your tubes tied! If you know you are not old enough or financially stable to take care of a child then don't have sex, just use protection. Don't just look for the easy way out because of your mistake! i don't get how if you kill somebody then you get charged for murder, and spend the rest of your life in prison....when on the other hand having an abortion is murdering a baby. To me that doesnt make any sense...and some people say but what if the person got raped and ended up pregnant.....well you can give it up for adoption, i feel that women who have abortions are selfish and are only thinking about themselves. They really don't care about what the baby goes through and that is completely wrong!"
2,"100% i think its wrong! I am not religious, but who has the right to take a life? Isn't that the very reason Murderer's are punished?If a person really can't have a child because they aren't ready, or any other reason, then surly it is fairer to still give that life a chance and put the baby up for adoption to a family who is desperate for a baby and can't have one for themselves?"
2,OK this is not an argument against abortion but I do think it is a good reason they should be banned. I'll let the story speak for it's self.
2,"“For You created my inmost being;You knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in a secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, Your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in Your book before one of them came to be.” Psalm 139:13-16. God created you, He created me, and He has created everybody. Life is a gift. Nobody has a right to take away that gift. Life starts at conception. Mother Teresa said ""What is taking place in America is a war against the child … And if we accept that the mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another."" This war against the child is abortion. If I tell a pregnant woman she can kill her baby, why can't I tell a man that it is alright to murder a three year-old. What is the difference between killing a baby nine weeks after conception and murdering a child nine weeks after birth? During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945. These people include Jews, homosexuals, Slavics (Russians, Poles, and others), Gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Christians found helping the targeted people. That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers. But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers? From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed. This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust. For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.4 million babies each year. The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year. The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves. Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children. To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?  Dr. Richard Land, president of The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission,said ""We lose more babies through abortion every year than the total fatalities in all of the wars in which we have ever participated, commencing with the French and Indian War and including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War I, and Gulf War II.” In 2005 1.2 million abortions were performed. Even though this number is the lowest since 1974, this is still too many abortions. Every twenty seconds a child is aborted. Fifty-six percent of women who have abortions are in their twenties and sixty-one percent of women who have abortions have one or more children. According to Guttmacher Institute, the reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Three-fourths of women cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals; three-fourths say they cannot afford a child; three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents; and half say they do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner. Many pro-choice posters say “My Body. My Right.” Woman don't take into consideration that their decision to have an abortion affects not only their body, but the unborn babies. Jeremiah 1:5 says ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Lord knew you, even before conception!  Women who have abortions are only thinking about themselves. What have they forgotten? Have not considered that this baby is a living person? Three weeks after conception a baby has a heartbeat and at four and a half months she can experience pain. By nine weeks, he has begun to develop blood vessels, eyes, lungs, ears, arms, legs, mouth, nose, the color of his eyes, fingers, toes, brain, joints, teeth, spinal cord, nervous system, and facial muscles. He can also hiccup frown, squint, turn his head, touch his face, breath (without air), stretch, and yawn. He is well proportioned, about the size of a thumb, and every organ is present. Exodus 21: 22-25 says “If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.” But instead of condemning women who have made this choice, we should come to them with compassion, offering them help. After a woman has an abortion, her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief. Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years —5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual. Guilt, regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, dreams and nightmares, flash-backs, anniversary reactions, hostility toward men, crying, despair, and even suicide attempts are symptoms of Post-Abortion Syndrome. Many women turn to drugs and alcohol as a way of masking the pain. Anniversary reactions are an increase in symptoms around the time of the anniversary of the abortion, the due date of the aborted child, or both. We should also inform women who are considering abortion about the procedure and effects of abortion and other options such as adoption. Crisis Pregnancy Centers can be found in most metropolitan areas. Many Crisis Pregnancy Centers in Illinois metropolitan areas offer pregnancy tests, ultrasound services, adoption plans, parenting education, clothing rooms, and post-abortion help. According to Hope Pregnancy Ministries ninety percent of abortion-minded women choose life after seeing their ultrasound. Luke 1:42-44 says “In a loud voice Elizabeth exclaimed: ""Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.” When Mary enters Elizabeth's house, John, an unborn baby, leaps for joy because he is in the presence of the Christ, another unborn baby. Dr. James I. Lamb, executive director of Lutherans For Life, said “Both Mary and Elizabeth experienced an ‘unplanned’ pregnancy. Both their babies were still in their wombs. Both trusted God in seemingly impossible situations."" That the Christ would become a baby shows just how sacred life is."

2,"Unborn babies are living things and when you kill them, it is the same thing as killing an adult or a child. God is the creator of life and when you kill unborn babies you are destroying his creations. In the beginning God created Adam by breathing the breath of life into his nostrils. “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.” Psalm 139:13. Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides. If somebody did this they would be breaking the fifth commandment: You shall not murder. He or she is also breaking the first commandment : You shall have no other gods. You should help everyone stay healthy and alive. I have four sisters and I am glad none of us have been aborted."
2,"I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions. Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception: Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being. This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them. Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby. First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should. There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie. Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law. In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies. Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong. My own mother has 6 children and has never had an abortion!!"
1,"Abortion is justified when the fetus is certain to suffer and die from a disability: Finally, due to advances in medical technology it is possible to determine during pregnancy whether the child will be disabled. In cases of severe disability, in which the child would have a very short, very painful and tragic life, it is surely the right course of action to allow the parents to choose a termination. This avoids both the suffering of the parents and of the child.
"
2,Yes it should be banned. People shouldn't be having sex if they don't wanna a baby. Or it should be protected. Killing babies is a crime.
2,yes abortion should definetly be banned because if you look at it from court/police type of view then you could definetly call it murder if you abort something beause the actual definition of murder is killing somebody with intent.so abortion should definetly be banned!!!
2,"I say they should, but it depends. If the woman got raped or a mother could die, I could see some instances where they should not be banned. But basically everything else to me should be banned. So, due to majority, I will say it should be banned :). The term abstinence has apparently become extinct these days..."
2,I agree with you except on the issue of rape. Why should the child be killed for a crime they didn't commit?
2,Why should the woman carry out the child for a crime in which she was a victim and for a child she did not want to have? It could go both ways. Leave it up to the woman to decide.
1,"Abortion for Rape Victims?  By Gregory KouklIf we allowed an abortion under those circumstances it would send a terrible message, that when someone reminds you of something extremely painful you can eliminate them. But you can't kill another human being just because their existence makes your life physically or emotionally burdensome.If I had a law on my desk that restricted abortion except in the cases of rape or incest I would sign it, even though I don't think rape and incest ought to be exceptions. I'd just rather save 98% of the children whose lives are taken through abortion rather than none.©1999 Gregory Koukl.

2,"You are assuming from a Christian article that everyone in the world must believe in Christianity, which can't happen because God gave man free will. Of course it is not morally right if you are a Christian, but not everyone is a Christian and you have to respect their rights as well. Did not Jesus command, 'love your neighbor as yourself'? Your neighbor could be a Christian, atheist, wiccan, whatever, could they not? It is not up to you to judge someone, leave that to God. No matter what you do or say, people will continue to have abortions in the world. It is an unfortunate fact of life, similar to war, similar to racism, similar to obesity. You see them committing a sin and loudly call them out, but you are being hypocritical because you also sin. You are saying that you are perfect and never sin, which, unless you are Jesus coming back down again, is impossible. I am a Christian as well, but I realize that it is wrong to judge and criticize someone for sinning when I do the same thing as well, albeit a different type. Like I said earlier, leave the judging to God."
1,"So let me see if I understand you. Killing children isn't actually wrong. It is only if you believe it is. So what Hitler did was good because he thought it was. And it would be good, by your logic, to kill you so long as I believed it was right. Since when does right and wrong depend on what one believes? This is certainly not the view of right and wrong that Jesus of Nazareth held. To be a follower of Him means to hold the same worldview has he does.About loving: To love someone means to seek the very best for them and protect them from what harms them, You can't say you love someone and then stand by when they are being harmed when it is within your power to do something. Humans in the early stages of life just happen to be your neighbor. Go back and read the passage on the Good Samaritan. Your position is the one the Pharisee took and the one Jesus condemned.about judging: The passage of scripture were Jesus deals with judging doesn't condemn judging nor forbid it. It does condemn judging hypocritically however. It then goes on to say "" first remove the log from your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers"" If judging is wrong for you? why did you judge what I wrote? are you saying that you are perfect and never sin? I guess you don't leave the judging to God do you."
2,"No, you are way out in left field. Stop the red herrings and keep it to the topic. What does Hitler have to do with abortions? As I said earlier, one of two commandments to adhere to as a Christian (that Jesus said himself in the gospels) is to love your neighbor as yourself. Let me ask you, what did Jesus believe about abortions, since you feel that my interpretation is not right? What is the view of right and wrong according to Jesus of Nazareth?You stand by and watch people kill each other during war. What kind of love is this? Yes, you can do something concerning abortions. Judging them as a murderer however does not encompass this. That is the main point of my argument. I am saying you cannot judge someone to be murderer and that they are automatically going to hell because they have an abortion.What do you mean by 'judging what I wrote'? Judging to me is calling a male gay because he wears pink, calling a person retarded because they fail a grade in school, and calling a person hell-bound who has an abortion. Apparently you did not read the last part of my statement concerning sin. Also, I need to know what your definition of judging is, since you disagree with mine."
1,"Lets see Hitler killed people. abortions kill people. Wow your right, no correlation at all, a true red herring.Want to know what Jesus taught about abortion, right and wrong and judging people? Go get your Bible and knock off the dust because it would be wise to ask Him not me.Final thought; We are all lawbreakers and apart from the grace of God, all of us are going to prison for a long time for comic treason. And since the one we offended is infinite in worth, the debt we owe is infinite also. So consider what infinity minus 10 thousand is, infinity. That's how long it will take to pay the debt. But that's not the question at hand is it; it's about abortion. And for that there is only one question; what's being killed? If it's not human, no justification is necessary. No one needs justification to remove a tumor do they? But if it's a human being killed in an abortion then no justification is adequate.So if you think abortions shouldn't be banned, please tell me exactly what is being killed in an abortion,"
2,"What right does anyone have to deprive another of life on the grounds that they deem that life as not worth living? This arrogant and sinister presumption is impossible to justify, given that many people with disabilities lead fulfilling lives. What disabilities would be regarded as the water-shed between life and termination? The practise of eugenics is roundly condemned by all civilised countries.
"
2,"Hitler was a murderer for having abortions? Like I said, keep it to the topic. Hmm, lets see...You dispute me, I ask for evidence as to why you dispute me, you come up with ""go check the Bible."" I'm still waiting for the evidence. I ask two simple questions. What did Jesus say about abortions? What is right and wrong according to Jesus? I mean, if you want to cop out and not answer them, you shouldn't keep the debate going, since you were the one who disputed me.We are all lawbreakers. So how should one type of sin get emphasized over the other? God looks at every sin the same way, except for blasphemy against HS. A person who commits a murder commits the same sin in the eyes of God as someone who lies. Why are you trying to deny it? You have no right to tell someone that their sin is worse than yours, because you are not God, and God does not judge sins that way except for one, blasphemy against HS. ""Go get your Bible"" if you think I am wrong. I can't keep arguing with you if you continue to take the debate off topic. We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion. I have said this throughout my past statements, yet you want to keep diverting the topic to something you feel comfortable with. I put my first statement under the 'abortions should be banned' view for a reason. The question is not about what is being killed in an abortion. Obviously it is a human being imo. Again, stop cop-ing out and keep it to the topic. Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?"
1,"The funny thing is you say that I say a whole lot of things that I can't find in the things I write. Maybe you could help me out and tell me were I said such things like: ""Hitler was a murderer for having abortions""""You have no right to tell someone that their sin is worse than yours"". I said that?""Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?"" Were did i do that? I thought the question was; Should abortion be banned. And help me with this one: ""We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion.""Who is judging someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?Please show me were I said that.Just for the record; my view is that everyone of us, apart from the grace of Jesus Christ, is hell bound for the high crime of cosmic treason, aka idolatry. Romans 1:18-25Romans 1:25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.If I remember correctly you responded to a post I made quoting Greg Koukl who i thought made a very good point regarding the question of this debate and you responded with, you can't use that, it's Christian. How very judgmental of you.Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches. I'll help you out. And note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder. About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here. That's an objective standard, not a subjective one as you suggest. And he says in the last passage that all men will be judged by this law. That means it applies to all men, at all times and in all places. that is the polar opposite of what you say.So one of you has got to be wrong.Matthew 19:17-19 17 So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”18 He said to Him, “Which ones?”Jesus said, “ ‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ 19 ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”Matthew 5:20 For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven."
2,"infer (v)- to derive by reasoning; conclude or judge from premises or evidence-----I have stated in my previous arguments that you should not judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion, and you disputed my argument. Therefore, I can infer that you are against what I have said.----I can see now that we have been arguing two different questions. The question is not about whether abortions should be banned or not. I already answered that they should, with there being exceptions for special circumstances. One of those special circumstances I mentioned was rape, and you disputed me on that circumstance. That does not mean that I am against abortions being banned; I would like for that to happen. I think you got mixed up when I said that and inferred wrongly. -----Practically all Christians are against abortions, because it goes against what the Bible says. I am against them too, however I do not believe it is right to judge someone in a negative manner if they do have an abortion. The same goes for gays as well concerning harassment. You shouldn't judge someone, period. When you judge someone, it eventually leads to hate, and God will not forgive you if you do not forgive you neighbor for what they have done. People make bad decisions every day. Their (people having abortions) sin should not be ridiculed upon or emphasized as one of the worst sins, because we also commit sin, and God looks at every sin the same way, except for the one I mentioned in my previous statement. You should tell them that what they are doing is sinful and pray for them, but I don't believe you should harass them and look down upon them for what they have done.-----I am inferring that you are a Christian, although I may be wrong. Could you specify what religion you follow? I am a nondenominational evangelical.-----I get what you are saying with Romans 1:18-25, but what you fail to realize is that although a person has an abortion, that does not mean that they cannot be forgiven of it and become Christians later on. The only sin in which you cannot be forgiven is blasphemy against the HS (Mark 3:29). You should not degrade them for what they have done, but encourage them to turn to God so that He can forgive them of their past wrongdoings. -----How very judgmental of you.You took it out of context. Read the entire paragraph and you will see my response. I also put in in bold in response to your other statement.-----Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches.Wow, and you are calling me judgmental...-----note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder. About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here.Jesus condensed them into two commandments for Christians to follow. See Matthew 22:36-40. They revolve around love, not murder.-----Hmmm...so let me see here. According to the verses you mentioned, you believe that you must follow the Ten Commandments in order to have eternal life? I want to make sure I understand your point of view, because I disagree with it if it is so. Romans 10:9,10""If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.""Ephesians 2:8,9:""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from youselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do""I can't go on until I know which religion you follow, but it is clear from these two verses that if you are a Christian, you are saved by faith in God, not by obeying the Ten Commandments. Paul touches on this in his letters. I don't have the time right now to look them all up, but I will list them later on if you would like me to."
2,"You are correct in your assessment of me. Doctrinally I consider myself a Reformed Baptist, but primarily a follower of the historical Jesus of Nazareth. I also think we agree for the most part, however I took exception with several things you said because I found them to be inconsistent with a Christian World-view. Primarily your statement that Christian morality applies solely to Christians. That is known as moral relativism (for a full discussion of this please see the book by Francis J. Beckwith and Greg Koukl titled: Relativism: Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air ) The scripture I quoted was to make the point that morality, according to Jesus, was objective. I was very explicit about that; to infer anything beyond that is to read into what I said something that is not there. I also took and take exception to your insistence that we are commanded not to judge. The only thing I can find is a command not to judge hypocritically and then a command to judge once we have dealt with our own sin. I do agree with your sentiment of judgmentalism and the holier than thou attitude I think your are trying to address. If we are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone then we have nothing in which to boast. Even the faith I have is a gift from God Ephesians 2:8 I am by nature a murderer and hell bound sinner and deserving of the wrath of God, but I have received mercy and I 'm now commanded to go and show mercy as I have been shown mercy.But I ask how are we to fulfill the great commission if we first don't judge that people are murderers( see the sermon on the mount) and hell-bound? If there is no peril, there is no need of a savior and no need to warn people. And that means that Jesus died in vain. But Jesus made a judgment, people are murderers and hell-bound and it matters not how they got there, only that they need to be saved. And He asked me to go for Him and seek and save that which is lost. If I'm His follower than I'll do what he commands me.“If you love Me, keep My commandments"" John 14:15 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen. Matthew 28:19-20"
1,"No, as a Christian, I believe the morality that God gave and still gives applies to everyone of every race, regardless of religion. There is no such thing as another religion, for they are committing idolatry. Either you interpreted my statement wrongly or I misspoke. I don't believe morals are relative to peoples of a certain religion or a certain culture. If I did, I wouldn't be a Christian because I would be contradicting myself and my beliefs. I think it is important that we go over the verses in question and see the meaning behind it.Matthew 7:1-5""Stop judging others and you will not be judged. For others will treat you as you treat them. Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged. And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? How can you think of saying, 'let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.""My interpretation of these verses are that Jesus is warning you from judging someone else for their sin when you sin even worse, in other words being hypocritical. Now, as a Christian, it is your duty in Matthew 18:15-17 to kindly confront the person about what they have done, with the goal being to bring repentance in that person (James 5:20). You could also look at 2 Timothy 4:2, where it says that you should kindly correct, rebuke, and encourage with good teaching. You see what I am saying? You are not to judge someone, but to rather point out the truth to them so that James 5:20 can occur. To kindly come up to someone and tell them that what they are doing is wrong for the purpose of bringing them closer to Christ is not the same as pronouncing judgment upon someone. We are to judge the sin as murder, and always with the goal of helping the person see that Jesus is a solution for the consequences of sin. Now, if I go up to someone who commits an abortion and yell at them that they are going to hell for being a murderer, what does that solve? It doesn't solve anything. This is the kind of hypocritical judgment Jesus was talking about in Matthew 7. On the other hand, if you kindly go up to the person, show them where they made the mistake, tell them that they can be forgiven of it with the blood of Jesus Christ, and send them on their way, you plant the seed in them in which they can hopefully come to Jesus. Of course, it is up to them to decide, but by showing them the solution to the problem, you have a much greater chance of that person coming to grips with what they have done, and then turning to Jesus and becoming saved."
1,"Palinin,Help me with something if you can. As I read back through this debate something odd jumped out at me. You dismiss and ignore every point I raise and then expect me to answer every point you raise; why is that? waiting for a response."
2,"There is a difference between refuting and ignoring. I addressed every point you made and didn't keep bringing up topics that were irrelevant to the debate, such as Hitler.Abortion for Rape Victims?By Gregory KouklYou are assuming from a Christian article that everyone in the world must believe in Christianity, which can't happen because God gave man free will.So what Hitler did was good because he thought it was.What does Hitler have to do with abortions?To be a follower of Him means to hold the same worldview has he does.As I said earlier, one of two commandments to adhere to as a Christian (that Jesus said himself in the gospels) is to love your neighbor as yourself.We are all lawbreakers and apart from the grace of GodWe are all lawbreakers."
1,The Jewish Holocaust is considered a life issue.Life issues also include abortion and euthanasia.
1,HItler has everything to do with abortion!The only difference between the Jewish Holocaust and the Abortion Holocaust is that the abortion holocaust is longer and many more people have died!
1,"nearly everyday of the week, the US government (your tax dollars) is killing innocent children in Iraq and that does NOT seem to be such an issue"
2,"The fact that a child is likely to have a short life does not justify further shortening it: When you see someone who has very little, do you take away all he has? The short life expectancy of a disabled child does not justify his deliberate killing!
"
2,"Prev, show me how this has to deal directly with abortions being banned and I will answer it. I think you meant Afghanistan now anyways, we are pulling out of Iraq."
1,"attn Palinin2040:the double standard used by many anti-abortionist/pro-lifers makes me kinda blah about the so-called abortion debate [just give 'em education and contraception and watch the number of abortions drop]they wail-n-moan about innocents murdered in the womb (something the government has nothing to do with in comparison to war) but turn a blind eye every time a bullet or bomb. that they paid for, kills murders an innocent Iraqi or Afghan childwhy even bother discussing the thousands of Vietnamese killed in ""free fire zones"" and during ""carpet bombing"" raidsa young woman decides to ""kill"" her baby and the ""lifers"" don sack clothes and ashes. your government kills and the ""lifers"" rally behind the flag and cry patriotismthank goodness this rank hypocrisy is being well documented and will not be erased from history"
2,"To sum up your argument:Pro-lifers are hypocrites because they oppose the killing of babies from abortions while approving of the killing of babies during war.I understand your viewpoint, but I disagree with it. I don't approve of war at all, and I am pro-life for the most part. There are other people just like me as well, but you said many, so you are pretty much correct in your reasoning."
2,That is not even the argument. We are debating abortion not the war in iraq.
1,"Well, once it is a child, it already is illegal to kill it.Before the first tri-mester it's a cluster of cells with no more self-awareness than a kitchen table.So that wouldn't be ""killing a child"" at all.And don't start with the potential bs. Because by that logic you would also have to outlaw masterbation, and save every ejaculation in a cup separating out the thousands of sperms representing ""potential"" life and finding female eggs to inject them in.... 'course judging by your past arguement, I guess you'll try anyway."
2,"Yes, you are absolutely right, it is illegal to kill a child, but just because it a simple ""cluster of cells"" in the early stages of pregnancy, does that give us any further right to destroy it? Not convinced? Perhaps this example will help my point:You are walking through a farm one day, and you stumble upon a chicken egg that has been freshly laid. You step on it, and guess what? You have commited murder!I instantly know the reply to that statement, after all, it's just an egg, so therefore there isn't any developed life growing inside... yet! It doesn't matter how far the stages of development have gone, because there is ultimately going to be a child, and forcing an early abortion is the prevention of life, and in my eyes, is nothing short of an abortion at say the six month stage of a human pregnancy.By the way, if I may add this, then I would say that your view on the ""potential bs,"" and how we should ""outlaw masterbation,"" is either incredibly misguided, or incredibly stupid. Need I remind you that there are several billion sperm cells in each male. So, how many sperm cells are produced during the process of masterbation? I certainly wouldn't think billions, millions, or even several thousands!"
1,"Oh jeez, I don't know where you and that J whatever guy came from, but your critical thinking skills are absolutely awful on this topic.My point about the thousands of potential lives every time a guy cums are accurate.There are thousands of sperm, each ""potentially"" able to make a life if it finds an egg. This is every time a guy cums. Look it up. There stored in you, if you don't jack it or screw they're dissolved in the body or come out in your sleep. But it's a sperm holocaust literally everyday within our bodies.And I used that example to show J whatever exactly how silly the ""potential"" life argument is.Potential life is not a legitimate excuse against abortion. Because, exactly... like... I... said... we destroy thousands of potential lives every single time we masturbate, or don't masturbate, or even when we do have sex.Now, reread this twice if you feel a need to reply, and consult a dictionary if you have to, I'm tired of having to over-explain the simplest things."
1,"Every sperm is sacred, every sperm is graced;If a sperm is wasted, God gets quite irate.Let the heathens spill theirs on the dusty ground --God shall make them pay for each sperm that can't be found.Every sperm is wanted; every sperm is good.Every sperm is needed in your neighborhood!Hindus, Taoists, Mormons, just spill theirs anywhere,But God loves those who treat their semen with more care.Every sperm is sacred! Every sperm is great!If a sperm is wasted, God gets quite irate!-- Monty Python"
2,"By the end of the 1st trimester a baby . . . has started to develop blood vessels, brain, spinal cord, nervous system, eyes, ears, arms, legs, mouth, nose, thyroid gland, tongue, color of retina, fingers, toes, joints, teeth, facial muscles, eyelids, fingerprints, fingernails, vocal chords, and taste buds the heart has begun to beat makes reflex movements, swallows, and practices 'breathing' every organ is presentI want you to read that and tell me this is not a baby."
1,"great, another one.I've read it. I've read it a million times on this lame debate alone. You're not saying anything new, there's no great revelation anywhere in your arguement.None of what you say in any way points toward any kind of self-awareness. Science says it's not a baby, and nothing you said will stop a single abortion from happening.So stop, find another cause. Abortions have been going on since the beginning of time and all this foaming-at-the-mouth zealous ignorance has never stopped a single one. Every time in history you zealous foaming-at-the-mouth looney tunes have gotten your way and made abortion illegal it has lead to nothing but a bunch of dead little girls from botched abortions, and still not a single abortion is ever stopped.If you don't want an abortion, you don't have to get one. But if some poor young girl thinks that's her best option, then that's her choice.If god or whoever doesn't like it, then he can come down here and tell her himself.Stay out of it."
