2,"Teaching evolution exclusively is dangerous to science and reason. To exclude a set of ideas a priori is to potentially exclude the truth. Thus, as a matter of principle, science should not be constrained to a single set of ideas.  Creationists argue that both sides should be taught.  Evolutionists, on the other hand, limit the scope of science to a narrow acceptance of just one theory.  Thus, to teach evolution exclusively is to promote limitations on the power of scientific inquiry.  To teach creationism along side evolutionism is to promote open scientific inquiry and critical thought.
"
2," Creationism is scientifically testable. Some creationists have argued that 'creationism' is a theory consistent with the scientific method. The hypothesis it adopts is that God created 'the heaven and earth ...' some thousands of years ago, and that man did not ""evolve"" into his current state. Supporters of Creationism then cite supporting evidence for this theory.
"
1," Allowing creationism in schools would violate the separation of church and state A separation of Church and state necessitates that public schools not be a forum for upholding the validity or truth of certain faiths. This does not necessarily mean that Christian faith and ""creationism"" should not be taught as subjects of interest in public schools.

1,"I cannot argue with your opinions as to what you want to believe. We all seek purpose in life, I fail to see how ID can help us here."
2,Correct the only way that either side could be proven is wether or not we can prove or disprove God
2,evolution has never been proven and will never be proven because it never happened. on that note you also can't prove creationism ever took place because it just happened. there is nothing intelligent about the thought you evolved from hydrogen gas or any other non living thing.
2,"Although I firmly believe in evolution, it is only a theory, and even though theories have evidence and are backed up with facts, they are not 100% true and can probably never really be proven, like the Big Bang Theory. But just because something is a theory does not mean people cannot believe in it; I personally believe in both evolution and the Big Bang."
2,"Why is it more reasonable to conclude common descent rather than common design from the similarity we see among species. I would argue that common design is far more reasonable. Here is why. This is a quote from the article and the full article can be found at the link below.ConclusionThe methodology for inferring common descent has broken down. Proponents of neo-Darwinian evolution are forced into reasoning that similarity implies common ancestry, except for when it doesn’t. And when it doesn’t, they appeal to all sorts of ad hoc rationalizations to save common ancestry. Tellingly, the one assumption and view that they are not willing to jettison is the overall assumption of common ancestry itself. This shows that evolutionists treat common descent in an unfalsifiable, and therefore unscientific and ideological, fashion.Meanwhile, as far as the data is concerned, the New Scientist article admits, “Ever since Darwin the tree has been the unifying principle for understanding the history of life on Earth,” but because “different genes told contradictory evolutionary stories,” the notion of a tree of life is now quickly becoming a vision of the past — as the article stated, it’s being “annihilated.” Perhaps the reason why different genes are telling “different evolutionary stories” is because the genes have wholly different stories to tell, namely stories that indicate that all organisms are not genetically related. For those open-minded enough to consider it, common design is a viable alternative to common descent."
2,"It's all a theory. Scientist don't have a clue when there trying to figure out how life actually got started. Another debunked remember Ida it was supposed to be the missing link and they gave it a huge media plug telling the whole world this is it. Well today they went back on it and said that it's not even close it was some kind of cat. Just like on National Geographic 30 years ago when they showed an ape like skull on the from cover only to find out later that it was a hoax, and it was sold that this is it. It has to make you wonder if there is a agenda behind it."
2,"If man evolved from apes, then why is there still apes? To evolve is to change and the ape didn't. Evolution only an atheist's delusion."
1,"Just like Pluto orbiting the sun completely and gravity! They're theories, but in the scientific way of using the word"
2,"Aha! Exactly! And we now know that pluto is a PLANETOID! Not a planet.Percival Lowell and Clyde Tombaugh were blind fools! - to think they discovered a planet! Now, thankfully from the perspective of 20/20 hindsight we can arrogantly scoff at the error of their ways, for we now know that pluto is a PLANETOID, and that Percival Lowell and Clyde Tombaugh's contributions were actually counterproductive to the advancement of what we today call science...Thanks to the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) decision Pluto is a dwarf planet! Modern reality is defined not by the insane direct observation of physical reality by individuals peering into a tube, but decided upon through CONSENSUS of the GROUP. Certainly the individual mind has no value in todays society, and only the GROUP MIND can come to any real conclusion in the modern sense. And if you disagree and look up at the stars and think you see an object, that is just your personal opinion."
2,"No, evolution has yet to proven. Evolution consists of an organism who progressed into a more complex collection like animals, then into homosapiens,then into what we are today. If this were true, why has the evolution process ceased, why arent there half monkey,half men walking around who have just entered the middle cycle of evolution, why aren't we evolving to some strange terrestrial body? These questions obviously can't be proven. So no, evolution has not yet been proven."
1,"Evolution has not ""ceased"" in any animal. I think you are a little delusional on the subject. Let me clear this up for you:The transition of ""ape"" to homo sapiens is not a process that occurs through one generation.""why aren't we evolving to some strange terrestrial body""For the same reason, the whole transition to a ""new species"" is not a transition that occurs on one generation. And what do you mean by some ""strange terrestrial body""? You mean something different than what we are at this stage? For the same reason, it is not a one-generation process. Why would you not cause us a strange terrestial body today?and ""why aren't there half monkey half men who have just entered the middle cycle of evolution""Evolution has no scripture that is followed. There is no one path that all species must mutate with, which is the reason why chimpanzees still exist to this date.And by half monkey half man I might interpret that as a neanderthal, and those coexisted with homo sapiens for some time. Also if you want to see a half human half monkey today, you're gonna have to have sex with a monkey (although i am unsure if that would work out)."

1,"Again, we hit walls of diction, but it's a great debate and I'm on your side (evolutionists). I want to see the blood and guts of what constitutes ""proof"", however, and I find that blind faith goes in multiple directions. In other words: I've seen evangelists of science as blinded as their christian counterparts. Loops/fractals in math, nature, logic, and many other scientific methods give me the idea that 2 opposing viewpoints can be equally true, just as a segment of light can be seen as a particle or a wave, depending on the method. Quirky? yes. Contradictory? yes. Tell me what 0/infinity could mean, and my answer is: Both. Thinkaboutit."
2,I have not seen any animal turning into another recently to be honest...And I'd rather prefer not to think of myself as coming from an ape. Not too regal you see.
2,"Heck -- his girlfriend HAS more hair than she has now, even as we speak.Have you ever seen an unshaved man or unshaved woman nude in their early fourties?THAT ALONE is evidence that we're all apes."
1,To each their own as a personal belief I have nothing against those that subscribe to creationism but feel strongly that it does not belong in schools. There is no theory of creation it is not even a hypothesis it is a belief or faith. Given the current state of education I dont think america can afford to put faith in schools.
2,"Life consist of nothing but creations. Scientist create medicines such as, anti-biotics, and anti-dotes to fight bacteria and poisons to treat the problem and make you well. Other types of scientists that we wonder why are they getting paid such as (not all agree with me) marine biologist. I believe they study the ocean and sea and all that reside in them. What I'm trying to say is, If man have the ability to create something besides the sun, moon and stars. Who in their right mind would think that it doesnt take time and effort and a little thought into creating these beautiful things you wake up to each day?"
1,To me this is a simple one Evolution all the way. It is science plain and simple when and if creationists can show evidence for creation beside the bible then and only then should it even be considered. The fact of the matter is all they have are criticisms of evolution which does not amount to evidence of creation.
2,"You say the bible is the only proof of creationism. Um, biblical archaeology?? Archaeology is science too. Isn't evolution's bible Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species...""? It has been proved by other branches of science. And also, you think all things just appeared and began to evolve? Was life created out of thin air? And, if so, how was the air created? I beleive evolution could be, but as a stage after creation, that would progress life. Both could be one in the same. Just, I beleive, for evolution to exsist, that creation must have preceeded it. ""The origin of life is a necessary precursor for biological evolution, but understanding that evolution occurred once organisms appeared..."" How did they appear? What? ""... and investigating how this happens does not depend on understanding exactly how life began. The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions, but it is unclear how this occurred...""Unclear? Hmmm?""Not much is certain about the earliest developments in life, the structure of the first living things, or the identity and nature of any last universal common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Consequently, there is no scientific consensus on how life began, but proposals include self-replicating molecules such as RNA, and the assembly of simple cells.""How did RNA first become? I do not believe this debate is fair, because evolution has so many gaps in its reasoning. How can it be compared to creationism? They are two different things. I would say I agree with both, but the blatantly ignoring theology in scientific theory makes a rift between the two. So, creationism."
1,"actully, uncomplext compunds bonded to geather to create chemicals and very very uncomplect cell fragments that then banded to geather with otherthings for survival and formed the first very simple cells that then became more complext. (also, we have proof of human civilization that started with writings and buildings and history and bones before the bible says it all just happened)"
1,God was created by people who needed faith in something.did you know without Christianity we would be at least five-times advanced (forgive my grammar) Creation has been proven by very credited scientists and the only thing supporting god?... a book.
1,"Nothing ""appeared""- its very simple. A very long time ago, after the creation of the oceans, simple chemical reactions occurred that became more and more complex, and eventually created RNA, which developed into 2 cells. those cells began to multiply, and random mutations occurred, changing them ever so slightly. (Also, cyanobacteria developed, which developed that thin air you were talking about). Millions and millions of years of this evolutionary process, and now we have websites where we can debate about how we started."

1,"I think evolution is an actual truth, since we are able to prove it and all. However, i think the two are closely linked.But seeing as how everyone has their own beliefs, bleev what u want. My religion has already influenced me, so i'd like to believe God created the Big Bang and designed how evolution would occur. The Bible is not all truth sometimes, because the story of creation could just be a way to improve faith, not to state the way people came to be, we hav science for that"
1,"hey, i feel the same way! almost took the brain cells out of my head!"
1,"Intelligent Design doesn't refute evolution. it simply says that it was ""guided"" or ""started"" by something beyond explanation (at this time).creationism says ""God created man in his image""... nothing like Intelligent Design. Despite its origins, Intelligent Design has become something much more than just ""God did it"". Think of it based on the philosophy of Plato.and, Evolution is not a theory saying God had nothing to do with it. even its origins were not perfect but BECAME something better as we went along with it (like Darwin saying that the cell was very basic). the cell is actually another Universe."
1,"Evolution may not have been perfect when it was first thought up, but it was still pretty damn good. Why? Because it was based on observation, and evidence. It employed the scientific method to come up with an idea that changed the way we view our world. It is the foundation that unites all fields of biolgy.Intelligent design, on the other hand began as an attempt to discredit evolution, for religious reasons. It was put in text books (such as Of Pandas and People) as a replacement for creationism, because the supreme court ruled that creationism was a violation of the first ammendment. I'D has no scientific evidence to support it's claims and never will because it requires an unobservable ""inteligent agent."" That which is completely unobservable cannot be scuentific because science requires observation.Could ID be taught in schools? Sure...in a philosophy class, or in a science class as an example of what science isn't. As long as there is not one iota of evidence for ID, then it can never be taught as a theory."
1,"no scientific evidence, of course. but plenty of mathematical evidence. mainly because the mathematical answer for Life or the Universe is Undefined. ID doesn't say God directly (anymore, unless you are a creationist who believes in ID).back to math. The existence of the Universe and Life itself is considered mathematically impossible. But if something that's impossible is happening, that would be illogical. but it's also illogical to say that the Universe and life within it doesn't exist because we see with our very own two eyes that it is happening. So how is the impossible possible? Intelligent Design may not answer it, but it does open our minds to the idea that things aren't always as they seem. The very fact that our brains are the rational animal kind, we see things, often, in irrational ways. Our perception, in trying to be rational, has obscured reality into matching what is logical. But, it is both illogical and logical to say that these obscurities are right.idk, maybe what pisses me off is the harsh reaction to the idea of ID. I don't accept it as truth because there is not enough evidence to support it. but when working it out mathematically and looking to philosophy, it's not that improbable.You're right about ID not being taught as a science. But, science teachers should be able to bring it up as a possible answer. My Chemistry Professor (who despised creationists) would sometimes answer ""God did it"" because he knew there was no answer for certain questions (like how and why). He was able to dissect the Universe and Life as we know it into the smallest terms, but he was still unable to answer the most simplest questions on why certain things did things."
1,"The existence of the Universe and Life itself is considered mathematically impossibleI'm curious who (other than yourself) considers this to be the case. I know most scientists don't. The main reasons for this are:1) Much is still unknown about the creation of the universe, and therefore attempting to put a numerical probability on the chances of it's existence is futile, and clearly any figure is going to be wildly inaccurate.2) The universe is huge. The is so much stuff out there, that actually the chances of life occurring at least once, are probably pretty damn likely. As is the case with the previous answer though, we have no way of knowing the probability of life until we find (or don't find) other life.3) Every individual scenario is unlikely. If I were to roll a billion sided dice, the chances of any one number coming up are wildly improbable, however one number will come up. Does this mean God did it? Maybe, but much more likely it was chance. Compare this to life on earth. Every single individual life is wildly improbable (think about all the sperm cells that could have reached your mom's egg) however, once again when we look at the whole picture we see that life did have to happen, it just happened to take this form.idk, maybe what pisses me off is the harsh reaction to the idea of ID.I think the claims you've heard about the ""harsh reaction"" to ID have been either exaggerated, or flat out fabricated. The fight has been to keep ID out of the classroom, because it was being used merely as a way to undermine evolution. There are in fact Christian scientists who, more than likely believe that God is guiding evolution, however these people still know that ID is not scientific.What you need to understand is that no scientist, atheist, Christian, or otherwise takes the idea of ID seriously. You claim that it makes mathematical sense, then prove it! Show me some equations, that says that evolution needs an ""intelligent agent."" There is none. People used to think that rainbows were proof of an intelligent designer, because it was so unlikely that the light would just form in that way by itself. Well turns out it's not unlikely, and is simply refraction. Substituting ""God"" in for what we don't know has never gotten us anywhere. Looking for natural explanations may seem ""both illogical and logical"" (whatever the fuck that means) to you, but look at where it has gotten us (at this point you should look around you and think about what someone from the 1700's would think of your lifestyle). Maybe the world isn't completely rational, but so far all evidence points to the contrary.Edit: Just came across this video which is very relevant to my argument. I hope you take the time to watch it."
1,"ID doesn't undermine evolution. it doesn't say it didn't happen.and it's funny how all of a sudden you speak for every scientist. i think in Logical terms we call that a fallacy.I already said that it shouldn't be taught as a science (don't know what your rambling was about), I was just upset at how some people (not most though) react to it. you know, having to type extremely long explanations on why it's wrong (even though it proves nothing).As i've explained already, our brain automatically attempts to rationalize things and in that effect it is irrational. This has been proven (Mueller). I'm not saying that science is bad (it's one of my most favorite subjects to research on), I'm just saying that things aren't ALWAYS as they seem, and no matter how hard we try, we won't be able to reason certain aspects out because our brain won't accept it.and, I'm not saying ID has to be true just because the probability of life is practically zero. Obviously we hardly know shit about the Universe and Time. But because of this, it's not insane to suggest that there may be more to it (because there obviously is). ID may say that it's a God, and sometimes it will say it's just some kind of guide. Maybe some powerful force of energy that creates a guidance (the one i find most probable).but go ahead. just say that ID is creationist propaganda trying to destroy the theory of evolution."
1,"ID does undermine evolution, because supporters of ID wish to put a sticker in every textbook that says something along the lines of: ""Evolution is just a theory. It is not a fact, and has not been proven. There are other possibilities."" To deny that ID is being used to undermine not only evolution, but science as a whole, is...to put it lightly a dumb thing to do. Look at the video I posted. In it you can actually see people using ID to do just that.If you or anyone else wants to believe in some guiding force, great. That's what freedom of religion is all about. No one is attacking anyone's personal beliefs. If you think that there are significant number of scientists who disagree with me, I challenge you to find me some. I would be interested in hearing their opinion.While on fallacies however, I think we should address the straw man you continue to present as your reason for defending ID. In previous debates, you said scientists were fired for ""just mentioning ID."" I gave you a list of people you might be referring to, and why this was not the case with each of them. You never responded to that argument, and haven't mentioned it since, so I am going to assume that you admit that you were mistaken. (If not, I would love for you to give me an example of someone who was fired for bringing up the topic.) Now, your reason for defending ID is that people (like me) get upset when the topic is brought up. Let me repeat what I said earlier. If you want to talk about philosophy or theology, I would be perfectly willing to talk about a ""guiding force"" that controls life. However, until you have some evidence, or even some type of realistic scenario, then we can't talk about it in a scientific way. It isn't possible. What I get angry about is when people attempt to teach ID in school. You have already agreed that it shouldn't be taught in school. I'm not even sure at this point why you're disagreeing with me.I'm just saying that things aren't ALWAYS as they seem, and no matter how hard we try, we won't be able to reason certain aspects out because our brain won't accept it.So we should fill in the gaps with ""it's magic"", or ""God did it""? Again if you want to say this as a personal belief GREAT*. But it is better to say I don't know, and try to figure it out rationally. Usually, the results are pretty damn useful (modern medicine, airplanes, computers, etc...). But maybe that's all made up and we're just rationalizing magic. Hell, right now maybe I'm typing on a magic keyboard and my brain is rationalizing what it sees by saying that my computer is just a bunch of integrated circuits powered by a stream of electrons. I must be fucking delusional."
2,I don't really care :| 
1,"Once again generalizing on an unfair term. Most people who believe in ID (i've already said that i don't accept it as fact) also believe in Evolution. They do not conflict with each other. Creationists want to say that evolution is just a theory, ID believers do not (usually).I was disagreeing with your generalization of ID belief. as for the scientists thing, Caroline Crocker's contract was no renewed and the reasons mentioned her belief in Intelligent Design. I'm sorry i don't have a list ready of all the scientists who were ever fired.I've posted this before, but here you go again. non-religious scientists who believe in IDa couple are a bit extreme, but most of the guys on here are pretty rational ID believers (and are not religious), and, they're scientists and scholars.I admit that I don't know. I do try to figure things out rationally, and ID happens to be a very rational conquest for the answers to the Universe. It's not the only theory i consider though, I have over 9000 theories in my head and I am constantly dissecting them in my head trying to figure out how i can possibly put them together or change them around a bit so that they are more reasonable.and you keep on trying to make it sound like i want scientific conquests to stop... I don't understand why you continue with that argument after i've constantly repeated that i want scientific research to continue and that i don't want it to stop at ID.it's an unfair argument. You seem to want to paint me as an irrational creationists when it's obvious i'm nowhere near that."
1,"We do seem to be arguing past each other, and I will apologize for some of that.As for Caroline Crocker, I mentioned her in my previous argument, of people who were not fired for merely mentioning ID. If you would like to hear the real story of what happened with her please look here. As the article shows, she actually taught creationism, and made flawed arguments against evolution. The students were the ones that complained, and she later lied about being blacklisted.As for your post of non-religious scientists, I must point out that that is a blog and not a scientific peer reviewed journal. Because I am not a scientist myself I cannot accurately peer review them, however I can say that I can see what appear to be flaws in their arguments. They talk about ""specified complexity."" What this means is that a system, is too complex to have evolved. Another term that is often used by ID proponents is ""irreducible complexity."" This argument has already been debunked by numerous scientists including Ken Miller. Here is a video of him proving the argument to be invalid. What this leads me to believe is that there are other flaws, and that they are merely giving specious reasons for ID."
1,"This is why i have my doubts about ID too, but the main premise of it (which is why i accept it as probable) is still very rational. People will try to make their reasoning for certain ideas, and I don't condone or condemn them (just how the Big Bang theory is still filled with a shit load of holes). It may be because I think more philosophically and mathematically then i do by senses and the scientific method... it's not that i ignore science (as i've said, i embrace it and continue to study it), I just see how science, when taken to an extreme, can lead people to think too linear.I see how we are debating on a sort of different path. We both accept Evolution as a valid and most reasonable theory on the track of life. You think more on the what can be physically proven scale and on what you say, i agree. But concrete thinking was never enough for me. although ID is not acceptable to me just yet (so far, no theory on the Universe is acceptable to me yet), I believe that we can incorporate it (as i've said, the mass form of energy that creates a guidance) with what is rational to even atheists.Or maybe not, Philosophy is a pretty harsh subject now a days. How much I wish more people could become philosophers (seriously, we had three of the greatest in a row and now nothing)."
1,"And I guess those differences bring us right back to the atheist vs. agnostic thing. Oh well.Out of curiosity, what three philosophers are you referring to?"
1,"Aristotle, Socrates and Plato.Plato being my favorite. Socrates I like a lot too mainly because I think like him on how there is no real answer for anything. That if you look into all beliefs and theories, you will find a flaw. This is why i am constantly skeptical of beliefs but I still hold them because I take elements of them to try and rationalize other beliefs.long explanation on how my mind works... i'd rather not.But maybe we can see Philosophers in different lights. After all, Marx and Adam Smith can also be considered philosophers. Marx saw a greater picture kind of thing and Adam Smith was really just an economist, but his Invisible Hand of the Market belief go a great deal along with philosophy. (and, of course, I like Smith and i dislike Marx).Einstein thought philosophically. He thought a bit on the lines of Pantheism, actually, a lot. He considered himself of an agnostic because he was astonished by the brilliance behind the Universe. But, on religion, he didn't focus too much on whether he was agnostic or w/e... he even said that ""if you're religious, you might consider me an atheist"". And on how the atheist would consider him religious (sort of how people constantly view me).So maybe philosophy is still vibrant. or not. maybe i'm wrong about the last few mentioned."
1,"That if you look into all beliefs and theories, you will find a flawThis is very true for almost all theories. In fact even the fundamental theories of sciences still have a surprising number of holes. Molecular theory is a great example.I'm surprised you didn't mention Thoreau. I don't agree with everything he says, however he has been extremely influential. One of my favorite quotes by him is ""simplify, simplify, simplify."" He recognized that modern life, and materialism tend to complicate life, and draw us away from what makes us human. Looking at our culture, it's pretty easy to see how right he was."
1,the list practically goes on. Maybe Einstein was the latest.But I wonder who's the next...
1,"Evolution has more supporting details than the theory of intelligent design. Though, both still remains as a theory because it is still not proven to be otherwise. The evolutionism concept is more based on logic and radical studies. But though I still don't believe that our origin is that of a primate; I like to think that we are an origin of human at the beginning of time and mutate over time. Darwinism concept of primate origin has still a big void that is still left unresolved. So it really comes down to what you want to believe in because both still runs unsupported facts."
1,"OK. Here's the way I think about it.Creationism is most often related to Christianity's form of creation. So, if we taught creationism in school, shouldn't we all have to learn about each religion's form of creationism? That way we keep the divide between church and state. We can't indoctrinate our students one way or the other, and being fair with religious education would mean we spend years talking about each religion's ideas on evolution, creationism, or whatever other ideas are out there. We just can't let there be Evolution and then Christian Creationism. There are others."
2,"""evolution has basically been proven"", ""there is no evidence for the Biblical story"" common claims made by evolutionists. Out of all the claims, I've never heard any solid evidence to support them. There's no evidence for the biblical story? Then why is the top of Mt Everest covered in fossilized clams? Why have sets of human footprints have been found on top and next to dinosaur footprints? Why are there so many ""fossil graveyards"" (the result of swirling water eddies)? Why did the earth have to be created instantaneously (www.halos.com)? Evolution is a fact? Then why have fossilized whales been found standing vertically on their tails? Why are the layers of coal formations connected? Out of the billions of fruit flies/bacteria generations observed, why have they only produced after their kind? Why is the age of the earth severely limited?: The moon is moving away from the earth each year, and would have been touching earth 1.3 billion years ago; long before then lunar tides would have wiped out life. Earth's spin is slowing down, so less than a million years ago it would it have been going much too fast for anything to survive (centrifugal force, 5,000 mph winds). Need more questions?"
2,currently   science   feels it's accelerating... and considering the '13.7 billion years' it's been doing so.. I don't anticipate any collapse...  why would it still be accelerating?the Bible mentions a hint -- 11 times even in 5 chapters... God 'stretched' out the heavens.  Funny how the expansion of the universe is biblical.. yet we have only recently discovered it... but of course - presuming we have a creator can't contribute anything to science! right?  How would we know... so few try.
1,OK. Great. But I don't understand why you opposed my argument...Everything you said sounds so ridiculous it borders made-up. Many of your questions don't even make sense. I don't need more questions. I need more answers. I think andsoccer said most everything that needs to be said other than that.
1,"Wow...where to start?First, there is no such thing as an ""evolutionist"". Evolution is not a religion or belief system, but instead a well tested theory backed up by evidence in many scientific fields such as geology, embryology, genetics, and other fields of biology. A more accurate term to use would be scientist because over 99% of scientists agree with evolution. But hey, what do they know?I will talk about the evidence for evolution later but first allow me to answer some of your questions:Then why is the top of Mt Everest covered in fossilized clams?That's simple. The surface of the earth is covered by large masses of land known as tectonic plates. There are two types of tectonic plates, oceanic and continental. When two continental plates collide, mountains form. In this case, the Indian subcontinent collided with the Eurasian Plate forming the Himalayas. In fact this collision is still occurring and Mt. Everest is rising a few inches each year. What does this have to do with fossilized clams? At one point during earth's history, the rocks that currently make up the Himalayas were underwater and during this time the clams would have been fossilized. The mountains were raised later. In addition, if you are trying to say that these clams are evidence of the biblical flood (if you are not please correct me), then you should know that fossilization of the type witnessed on the top of Mt. Everest could not have happened in a short amount of time. They would have to have been covered for thousands of years. Didn't the flood supposedly only last 40 days?Why have sets of human footprints have been found on top and next to dinosaur footprints?Short answer: They haven'tLong Answer: Although creationists originally claimed that ""man-tracks"" appeared with dinosaur prints near in Glen Rose Texas, these assertions were later proven to be false. The supposed human footprints were in fact shown to be dinosaur footprints that had been eroded, natural features, and some doctored and carved specimens.Why are there so many ""fossil graveyards"" (the result of swirling water eddies)?Could you be more specific? I have never heard the term fossil graveyard, and I fail to see how this could possibly point to ""swirling water eddies.""Why did the earth have to be created instantaneously (www.halos.com)?This theory was thought up by Robert Gentry, who based his conclusion on what he called ""halos"" found in certain primordial rocks. Gentry is a physicist not a geologist however, so his method of observations, and the conclusions he comes to are flawed. You might as well ask a plumber to falsify string theory. The problems with his research are numerous, but for the sake of brevity I will give you the basic reasons why he's wrong. - The rocks he was examining were not part of the primordial crust of earth, but instead much younger, and therefore not reflective of earth's formation. -He does not show that polonium is the only possible cause of the ""halos."" In fact, other scientists who reviewed his work have determined that Uranium (which decays much more slowly) is the real cause. This is because the rings were most common in areas that were Uranium rich. If the cause had been Polonium, this would not have been the case. -Gentry attempts to rationalize the apparent conflict between his results and all other geological evidence for the age of earth, by proposing that decay rates have changed. There is no evidence for this, and the phenomenon is impossible according to current atomic theory. If he is right, then there is no reason that Polonium decay rates couldn't have changed as well, and therefore his entire conclusion is baseless-His theory requires at least three instances of divine intervention. Science does not deal with the supernatural.Then why have fossilized whales been found standing vertically on their tails?What does this have to do with anything? I don't know specifically what your talking about, however, if I were to speculate this could be because either rocks containing the fossils were pushed vertically by volcanic or tectonic activity, or that an underwater avalanche buried a whale vertically. Until you show me specifically what your talking about though, these are just guesses.Why are the layers of coal formations connected?Once again, I'm not sure what your talking about.Out of the billions of fruit flies/bacteria generations observed, why have they only produced after their kind?I assume by kind you mean species. If that is the case, then you are severely mistaken. There are numerous examples of observed speciation, especially among bacteria. In fact, in 1975, a strain of bacteria was found that could digest nylon. Nylon was only invented in 1935, so this was obviously an evolved trait. Fruit flys have also been observed in laboratories to evolve. In addition we see bugs evolving all the time, to become resistant to pesticides. If you want more examples of instances of observed speciation look here.Why is the age of the earth severely limited?: The moon is moving away from the earth each year, and would have been touching earth 1.3 billion years ago; long before then lunar tides would have wiped out life. Earth's spin is slowing down, so less than a million years ago it would it have been going much too fast for anything to survive (centrifugal force, 5,000 mph winds).Your figures are out of date. The whole, moon touching the earth 1.3 billion years ago, was a problem in the 1960s. Since then, newer and more accurate models of the earth-moon system put the moon a good distance away from the earth 4 billion years ago. Scientists had to take into account how shifting landmasses on earth (due to tectonic activity) had an effect on the moon's movement.Your second claim is laughable. I don't really know how to answer you other than to say that it's not true. Yesterday the temperature was one degree colder than today. Does that mean I can conclude there as an ice age less than a year ago? The earth is slowing down, but not nearly in the way that you described.Okay, now that that's over with we can talk about evidence for evolution.Out of all the claims, I've never heard any solid evidence to support themI'd say that's probably because creationist blogs don't have much information on the topic. I however do. Let's break it up into a couple catagories:FossilsScientists have been able to date fossils that are millions of years old, using numerous different techniques. What we see, when we look at the fossils we've found is a very clear representation of the evolutionary tree of life. Scientists have found literally thousands of transitional fossils, and not a single fossil has not fit within what evolution predicts. There were no mammals found during the Precambrian period, and no dinosaurs that dated less than 50 million years ago.If evolution were not true then how could you explain:1) How every dating technique used to identify the age of the fossils, turned up the same result? and how all of these results were consistent with evolutions predictions?2) How these transitional fossils exist?Observed instances of speciationAs I said earlier in the debate, we can actually see species evolving. The reason that the flu vaccine must be updated every year, is because the flu virus evolves each year. In this case, our knowledge of evolution actually saves people's lives. So you must ask yourself:3) If evolution isn't true, then why do we still see things evolving?I could go on, but this argument is already too long. If you have more questions go ahead and ask, but I'm much more interested in answers."
2,"The flu virus doesn't evolve, it mutates. Mutation and evolution are two different things. Evolution has never been witnessed happening. Scientists in support of evolution even state that. Evolution is a theory with a good argument, but it is a theory none-the-less."
1,"Mutation and natural selection are the two driving forces behind evolution. By mutating the flu virus is evolving. There is no difference between the two.Also, you claim that we have never observed organisms evolving: this is completely untrue. In lab experiments evolution is witnessed all the time.For exampleIn addition, scientists have also witnessed the evolution of species in the wild like the Italian wall lizard.This is one of the common misconceptions about evolution. That species evolve is observed fact...that they do so through natural selection is the theory."
2,"The bacteria mutated. They did not evolve into a new creature, granted that would take millions of years to witness. But, I agree, mutation would be a driving force behind evolution. However it isn't evolution itself. Mutations happen all the time in nature that never lead to a new evolved state in. Now the article about the lizards is pretty amazing. I had not seen that. I have never said that evolution or adaptation or what ever someone wants to call it does not happen. These lizards may adapt through a from of evolution to acquire what is necessary to survive in a new environment but there is no evidence of them changing into a completely different creature to survive. Still, that is pretty amazing. Now, if they grew feathered wings I'd be convinced."
1,"I think you have some misconceptions about what evolution actually is. Nothing ever changes into something completely different...that's impossible. Every generation is the same species as the previous generation, but with some added mutations orginally these mutations occur to the point where the end species cannot mate with the original, and that is where biologists arbitrarily draw the line as to a different species. In this sense we have seen many many examples of evolution.In addition, we really do see new species of bacteria, and no it wouldn't take millions of years for them to evolve into a new species. It might take a long time for them to be mostly unrecognizeable from their parent species but dissimilarity to an ancester species is not a requirement to the observation of evolution.In addition you claim that you would only except that scientists have observed evolution if they saw something without wings evolve into something with wings. Now obviously this is virtually impossible because the chances of parralel evolution of an exact same feature are virtually none, however I'm pretty sure you were being fecicious. Would you instead settle for the evolution of a mechanism in an organism that could didn't exist previously?I present for your consideration nylon-eating bacteria. Nylon obviously wasn't invented until 1935 and therefore this mechanism could not possibly have existed before this time.So there, it's not feathers but it is evolution."

Science has working theories for most of this stuff and if it doesn't it's working on them because that's what science does. It knows it doesnt have all the answers yet but the very fact that you can make arguments that you made is because you have a basic understanding of science. Dont worry, friend, the answers are coming faster every day."
1,"Evolution has been proven many times. The fossil records, DNA analysis, geographical distribution, real-time observations all point to evolution. It all makes perfect sense and no discovery has contradicted it yet."
2,"Evolution has not been proven. Were you there when evolution was happening? Are there any videos? Records? Pictures? No, there are not. Therefore, there is no concrete proof that directly points to evolution. Believing in evoluition requires an element of faith, because there isn't any concrete proof for it."
1,"""God 'stretched' out the heavens. ""That's the past tense, a process that happened but has since stoped... ""God is   stretching   out the heavens"" implies an active process."
2,"There is no actual absolute proof of evolution as some of the people here have stated. Before people post things, they should really do their research first. And for those reading this I implore you to do your own. Here are three basic reasons for why evolution is only theory and not a proven fact:1.) Evolution has never been witnessed. Dawkin's even states that, ""evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening."" He goes on to say that its like coming upon a murder scene after the murder has already taken place. It seems pretty obvious but there is no concrete evidence. Just obvious clues. ""It might as well be spelled out in words of English."" Well, it might seem obvious, but its not concrete evidence. It seemed pretty obvious that the world was flat once too. 2.) Science is constantly trying to prove the theory of evolution with suggesting that life itself was generated in a pool of amino acids and proteins by complete chance. However, so far all experiments to attempt to manufacture a self replicating DNA based Molecule have failed. If you don't believe me, look it up. Now, there is evidence supporting RNA based molecules. But, even if that turned out to be successful, it would still pose an interesting paradox being that science created the self replicating molecule, it did not create itself as theory of evolution suggests. 3.) The last point is the fossil record is incomplete. We do share similar bone structures with other animals but there is no defined developmental line. Not even slight mutations within each generation to warrant there being evidence of evolution. Though, I will add they are getting closer and closer every year to finding that missing link but closer and closer does not equal found. Now speaking about creation. I have read a lot of the arguments that are saying that creationism is faith based. Well, its just as faith based as evolution is. And there is just as much evidence, if not more, supporting intelligent design as there is supporting evolution. In all fairness there is no absolute proof for intelligent design as well. However, there is more substantial evidence for it. Here is one example:Patterns occur naturally without the need for a 'designer'. For example: snowflakes, tornados, hurricanes, sand dunes, stalactites, rivers, ocean waves etc... These patterns are a natural result of what scientists categorize as chaos. Science, in support of evolution, also uses chaos to describe what was before the ""big bang"". These things are well-understood and there is no debate in the scientific community. Now, take codes. Codes do not occur without a designer (programmer). Some examples of these include stuff like music, blueprints, languages, computer programs, and even codes of DNA. The basic difference is what happens between patterns and codes. Chaos can produce patterns, but it has never been shown to produce codes. Codes store information which is pretty good proof that DNA just might have been designed (programed). DNA is not a molecule with a pattern. It's a code, basically a language, and a storage device for information. All codes that we know of were created by a conscious mind. Therefore, evidence dictates that DNA was designed by a mind of sorts. The language and information of our very own DNA is proof of some sort of intelligent design.I for one believe that elements from both evolution and creation, working in tandem, is more likely that one or the other. But if I had to pick one I would say creation."
1,"Evolution has never been witnessed...All observations are retroactive. We have observed evolution in the lab and in nature. That s, we have seen novel structures and abilities rise in diversified populations in various settings, whether it by nylonase in flavobacterium or cecil valves in Italian lizards, polyploidy in flowering plants, infertile and fertile hybridization in mammals, speciation of Drosphilia and Promonella among many, many other observed instances of speciationScience is constantly trying to prove the theory of evolution with suggesting that life itself was generated in a pool of amino acids and proteins by complete chance.You're mixing up theories. And there are no proofs in science. Proofs exist only in mathematics and liquor.The last point is the fossil record is incomplete.First, your understanding of the field, which you are discussing is woefully lacking. Two, there are thousands upon thousands of fossils categorically identifying diversification over time of various phylogenetic lineages. Third, there is no such thing as a missing link. That's just a media term. Every new generation of a population consists of physiological and genetic differences from the parent lineage, thereby becoming intermediate exemplars.We do share similar bone structures with other animals but there is no defined developmental line.An organic, DNA/RNA replicating, protein based, metabolic and metazoic, diploid, bilaterally symmetric, gilless, internally heated, coelomate, with a spinal chord, reduced olfactory system, lacteal mammaries, a jawed skull, specialized teeth, with canines and molars, forward oriented and fully enclosed optical systems in a singal temporal fenestra in an amniote skull that is attached to a vertebrate, that are hind-leg dominant, with sacral pelvis, clavicle, with wrist and ankle bones, lungs, tear-ducts, body hair, opposable thumbs, plantigrade extremities with an embryonic development, including amniotic fluid and placental birth leading ultimately to a highly social lifestyle based on a shared complexity in the frontal lobe, enhanced limbic system all connected to a reptilian brain, shared bi-hemispheres that help process language and spatial cognition... etc. etc. That's just the apes. Of course we have a bloody idea of a defined developmental line. Don't confuse yourself.Well, its just as faith based as evolution is.No. No. No. No. No. Evolution is not faith based. It is observed. And it is verified by biology, virology, paleontology, embryology, genetics, population genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, phylogenetics. it is evidenced by ring species, gene frequency change, observations and descriptions of populations in controlled settings and in nature. Endogenous retroviruses, body plans, homologous structures, basal features... and the list goes on and on.I for one believe that elements from both evolution and creation, working in tandem, is more likely that one or the other. But if I had to pick one I would say creation.Of course you. But you also have no idea what you're talking about. At all, it seems. And that explains fully why you'd go with the fantasy instead of learning about the things that make the world you live in tick. And if you just knew--simply knew--what you are talking about, you wouldn't have to go to some ridiculous, undefined, designer using undefined terms like ""information"" and talk about chemistry as if it's a computer program. Do what you said: research (IT IS SO ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE NOT DONE ANY)."
2,"The aftermath of evolution has been witnessed but never the actual process itself. Its pretty good evidence but not concrete. With that said I never once stated that I don't believe in evolution personally. You said my understanding of the field is lacking. Well, I am not a scientist but I have researched this on both sides. If I am lacking I am open to learning more about it. But in this case I don't believe you are correct. You're are right about one thing though. There are thousands of fossils showing what look like steps but there is no gradual change. Your examples of a defined developmental line are actually examples of a fragmented developmental line. And there are a ton more you could list. What you are talking about is macro evolution. These are changes within a species but there is no evidence of micro evolution. There should be millions if not billions of transitional phases between species but we have yet to find them. Therefore, I suggest that the fossil record is incomplete. And I was being ironic when I made a comment about evolution being faith based. What I mean is, there is just as little, or as much evidence to support both sides. It always seems to me that Creationists are open to science but science is never open to creation. It comes across as incredibly close-minded. You say that evolution is observed. Well, intelligent design can be observed by the same definition. I even gave an example of it. But all you had to say was ""And if you just knew--simply knew--what you are talking about, you wouldn't have to go to some ridiculous, undefined, designer using undefined terms like ""information"" and talk about chemistry as if it's a computer program."" That isn't debating that is childish arguing which I don't participate in. I am also pretty sure its obvious what I meant by ""information"". And calling what I believe a ""fantasy"" and trying make me look like a fool is also a terrible way to approach a debate. Its just immature and proves that you are close-minded, not to mention it makes you seem incredibly unintelligent. You didn't even try to disprove the argument you just called it, in other words, stupid and left it alone. I typically don't debate with people that are immature. It just doesn't seem fair to them."
1,"I have no patience for people like you. I use to spend days arguing with know-nothings about the evidence for evolution, when I was studying biology. And that was when I cared. We'll start with evidence for design. And we'll start step by step.If it is so obvious, define ""information"" and pinpoint where it is located in a genome, in the chemicals: adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine (that make up DNA) or any combination of those chemicals, or in proteins or amino-acid chains (whichever you choose is fine). Explain how this ""information"" is transferred and adapted between living organisms and provide examples. How is the information stored?"
2,Why couldn't God have created everything through evolution?
2,Intelligent design is the conclusion of deductive reasoning. No other conclusion can be validly deduced. (The degree of faith that is required to embrace an unintelligent design greatly exceeds a rational faith)
1,Faith is believeing in something without evidence. You're the only one using faith here buddy. Evolution has more evidence than I could possibly tell you. From the fossil record to plant homologies to speciation. We've even observed evolution in labs at this point.
2,Evolution has actually never been observed. The aftermath of it has been observed. But there is no concrete evidence. Now mutations have been observed but mutation and evolution are two different things.
2,"Your definition of faith is atheistic; it actually denotes the essence of the term foolish. Explain how any person can believe in something about nothing that doesn’t exist. People can only know or not know of that which exists. If evolution is observable in the laboratory what is the name of the new species? Are you asserting that evolution is observable in controlled artificial laboratory experiments? Then, if you are, how is that evidence of evolution when it can only be evidence of artificial manipulation of a species? I thought evolution is a naturally occurring process, not a consequence of a controlled experiment in a lab. Allow me an opportunity, here and now, to describe in part my approach in answering the question of intelligent cause.The axiom of my argument: The laws of mathematics are the consequences of an intelligent eternal cause. No man or group of men can claim that he/they is/are the author of the laws of mathematics, for the laws existed before a man recognized them. We can however, fundamentally claim that man recognized by reason the known laws of mathematics, but never can it be claimed that man is the author of that which he has recognized by reason. The laws of mathematics existed before they were identified by man. They are eternally true. For example, 1+1+1+1+1100=1104 is true now, and is true thirty trillion centuries from now, and has always been true apart from time itself. This is an eternal truth for the equation is true apart from time itself. When there exists eternal truths that are only recognized by intelligence such as I describe there is an eternal cause of those consequences. And since mathematics is an exercise of knowledge and intelligence it is therefore the consequence of an intelligent cause.If someone would like to contradict the conclusion of my argument I offer an invitation to do so. However, the difficulty in opposing this view is that the opposition must prove that there was a time when 1+1= not 2. I have loosely laid out some of the evidence that supports the deductive conclusion that the whole of the creation is a consequence of intelligent design. And as necessary, I will add thereto so that my statements are understood in the manner I have intended."
1,"""I thought evolution is a naturally occurring process, not a consequence of a controlled experiment in a lab.""So you don't believe it's possible for a naturally occuring processes to be the consequence of an controlled experiment? That would be an interesting position to hold considering that's what science is all about. All the philosophical logic in the world won't help you if you don't have a basic understanding of what science is."
1,"PSYOP asks (rhetorically?): ""if the universe is expanding, what happens when that expansion ceases?"" First of all, the expansion of our universe is an observed fact.  No ""if"" about it.And why would cosmological expansion cease?  The same measurements which revealed the effects of some ""dark energy"" indicate that the expansion is accelerating.  If that is so then the question is mooted."
2,"Please take no offence to my response. I refute arguments not people.I do not believe, as implicated in your rhetorical question, that evolution is the consequence of a controlled experiment. For your rhetorical question expresses that the evolutionary natural process is a consequence of a controlled experiment. A controlled experiment evidences only a consequence of a controlled experiment. In a laboratory we can conclude as a consequence of an experiment that plastic is derived from petroleum. We can not say that petroleum will become plastic one day. We must always be vigilantly mindful of that which we think evidences one thing when we are controlling only some of the variables in any given experiment."
2,"It's called the THEORY of evolution for a reason. Do you know why? Because it's not the LAW of evolution because it has no proof! Even IF evolution was truth(which it isn't) it doesn't proove against intelligent design. Intelligent design constitutes that something created the universe; Aithiesm constitutes that NOTHING created the universe.Personally, I believe that the earth and universe was created in six literal days, and evolution has no more proof than creationism IMHO"
1,"Ignorance of terminology. A ""Law"" is just a description of a phenomenon.For instance: in a closed system, the amount of energy in that system is finite and thus the ability for that system to work reduces over time. That is the second law of thermodynamics. An example of a closed system is a small lighter, after so many uses it just won't work anymore.A theory, on the other hand, is a model of observations that explains those observations, and has predictive power. A theory is the highest point in scientific endeavor, because it utilizes facts, laws and observations in its explanatory powers, and is the direct result of verified hypotheses."
1,"A theory (as the word is used by scientists) is a detailed description of some aspect of the universes workings that is based on long-continued observation and, where possible, experiment, that is the result of careful reasoning from those oservations and experiments, and that has survived the critical studies of scientists generally.Example... we have the description of the cellular nature of living organisms (the ""cell theory""), of objects attracting each other according to the fixed rule (the theory of gravitation), of energy behaving in discrete bits (the quantum theory), of light traveling through a vacuum at a fixed measurable velocity (the theory of relativity). I could go on and on... but I think you get the picture. All are theories... all are firmly founded... all are accepted as valid descriptions of whatever aspect of the universe. AND NO THEORY is better founded, more closely examined, more critically argued, and more thoroughly accepted than the theory of evolution. If it is only a ""theory""... that is all it has to be.Creationism... on the other hand... IS NOT A THEORY! There is no evidence, in the scientific sense, that supports it. Creationism is an expression of Middle Eastern legend. It is no more than a MYTH.""Aithiesm constitutes that NOTHING created the universe.""Not a very good choice of words, by the way... atheists believe that God IS Nothing (in other words... something that is non-existent)."

1," What I feel in this context is creationism is nothing but a wrong assumption. Generally there are many supporters existing for the creationism but they are just living life in their own utopia. They should be guided right now. Normally we can find that many of them think this only for what the Bible says. Apart from this, a person who does not know science or evolution of life tends to believe that creationism is true. Sometimes, people think that creationism is science. According to the Bible, earth is flat but no one would believe this. If people trust Bible blindly then why do they not believe each and every theory said by Bible? My suggestion is to forget those things written long years ago without any logical approach. Modern science accelerated our life and we should respect the logical views without being driven by the blind dependence."
1, Yes evolution has hard scientific fact and the creationists put all of their faith in a book that is supposed to be the word of god but it was written by people. You see where I'm going here? Blind faith
1," None of the things that people put forward as evidence of a god are evidence for a specific religion. Thor? Zeus? Eighty Bird Men from Krypton?

1," There's no rational reason to accept creationism, it's simply empty claims with no evidence, it has no predictive powers, it cannot explain what we see in nature and it introduces a level of complexity with no explanation, requiring mindless faith.

1," The prospect of creationism is pretty absurd. One can't deny it from a logical point of view. I propose a compromise: Why can't we just agree that God created science and evolution? Wouldn't that yield the same result and please everyone?  />   /> The Scientists:  /> You would still have a place in the world because science would be even more of a mystery if God created it for you (that, and you would still have to figure things out on your own, like a real scientist).  />   /> The Religious People:  /> You can finally say that God created science, but that doesn't change the fact that our knowledge of it is still limited. We will need scientists, yes?  />   /> From what I can see, everyone wins."
1," As an archaeologist I have to say that creationism is wrong.  / Scientific dating , geology, paleontology and other sciences have proved beyond doubt that the evolution of the earth and life forms has taken place over billions of years.  /> Creationists might argue that this is all made up to discredit their theories but this isn't a credible argument.  /> What ever one's belief in a God or there is just no way that the earth was made in 7 days and came into being in 6006BC or whenever.  /> Humans or sub -human species have been around and evolving for over a million years.

1," Creationism is absurd and wrong and so its fellow-traveller, intelligent design. For one thing, the creationists hold that the Earth is only 6000 years old. That is laughably and provably false.

It is amazing that this sheer nonsense can be sustained in the midst of an advanced technological society.   />   /> Of course, as long as creationists do nothing other than hold their false beliefs privately, they don't do much harm.

1," To me, there is no proof of a greater hand other than from the word of believers, whose faith is based in belief and not in any form of evidence at all.

There is no explanation of how God fits into the mix there, it is simply natural functions that create birth through biology.  />   /> Cancer11's rhetoric is fluffy and without any proof or evidence, it is plainly to me utter faith.  Cancer11 believes that A is A because the Almighty says so.  Whereas science has constantly attempted to explore, examine and answer the questions of the universe by aiming to find proof, systems, patterns and was to name the world.   />   /> It is simply not possible for creationism is to be true. It has more holes than a leaky bucket."
1," Amusing, is all I can really say to cancer11's response. By questions such as 'can you make the sun shine on your own?' are you implying that the only reason for such a thing to happen is that God made it so? Do you require a proper scientific answer to that question?   /> I think the entire idea of creationism has gotten dearly out of hand. With science advancing so far it's strange to hear that people think, for example, that a God randomly, without any particular reason whatsoever, created the universe and everything in it. There are so many illogical flaws in that theory, it's unbelievable. Who would have thought that such a belief could spread so far?"
2," I'm AGAINST IT!!!  / Ahh!! I love the arguments in everyone the ""against it"" section. It totally rings true to my heart. I do see God everywhere! His beauty. Creation is just too darn beautiful to believe that it all evolved and happened by chance. People (part of creation) are just too amazingly built: Reproductive system, ears, eyes, brain, mind, a conscience (the sense of right and wrong),etc. I just will NEVER allow myself to believe in anything different than a creator."
1,"So if the Bible can be used as a source for scientific discovery or guidance then what else in there can be demonstrated to be true scientifically?  By what process did God 'stretch out' the heavens, where does God get the   energy   to do so?"
2, You see a building and you HAVE PROOF there is a builder...  /   /> You see a car and you HAVE PROOF there is a builder...  />   /> When you see creation there must be a CREATOR...  />   /> Faith.
2," Creationism is not out of the picture. God is still VERY much alive. And ya know what? The latest science, (that's right SCIENCE), is proving that. The Theory of Evolution is the linchpin for society and Science... Of course they're not going to want to abandon it. But... It will have to be abandoned. It's inevitable. There are too many holes in this THEORY. From the depths of space, down to the tiny, irreducibly complex machines within the cell, 'the glory of His work' can be seen. :]"
2, I do believe in creationism. God has created this universe and every living thing in it. Can‚Äôt you see the signs of God in each and everything; if not then I am sorry to say that you have no sense. A human being is created from a sperm. If he examines the process of his creation then he would definitely say that there is someone who is Almighty. Can you make the sun shine on your own? Do you have power to extend your life? Do you think you are unique and one of your own kind then you got the answer of this question. God is unique and He who to be worshiped only.
2," Read my comments, and you will truly see the mistake and stupidity in evolution."
2," Yes Yes Yes!!! The Bible so contradicts that. ""And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: And God saw that it was good."" Genesis 1:21"
1, You are under the mistaken impression that complexity and ability to buy washing machines equals more evolved. Prokaryotes are by far the most successful species on the planet earth and they don‚Äôt even have cell nuclei. 99% of the species and 50% of the biomass on this planet are prokaryotes. They constantly evolve and are thought to be the first living organisms on the planet.    /> As for the other simian species they have evolved just as much as we have just not in the same ways. The big question is big brains have allowed us to expand very quickly as a species but will it ultimately prove to be a quality that lends to survivability or not.
1," Just judging from the question, obviously the OP hasn't got even a high school understanding of what evolution is.  It's no wonder that you people don't get it, you're uneducated."
1," First, this topic has been on the site at least 50 times, even as recently as a week or so ago, and you should run a search before relaunching the same tired junk.  I've written more on other debates.  />   /> Second, all animals are subject to evolution, the versions you see them at now are the result of millions of years of natural selection, and as the environment continues to change all life will change or die, but that takes millions of years to play out.  />   /> Third, if evolution is wrong then what do you offer to compete with it?  Creationism?  Far far far more laughable than the holes you say exist in evolution.  Or if not creationism then are you just peddaling ignorance?  Are you just going to say you don't know or care where everything came from?  Not knowing or caring would just about make you a monkey after all Pyrus."
1," Look! There is no proof that God or any thing in the Bible existed! Where as, there is proof to suggest that we are related to monkeys as we have the same arm structure and the same bio-organisms."
1," It's impossible to argue with you people. I don't even know why i bother. Creationists not only do not attempt to learn anything about science, they resist learning about science. Every primate has evolved over the years. We were just the one's that managed to become sentient and intelligent."
2,"I'm hardly the authority for all the great questions in life.. and these debates make me feel as if I'm submitted as being so.. or required to be so.... That doesn't mean I don't have an answer... it just means it might not be correct... I'm flawed like everyone.As I already said.. the Bible is not meant to be a   science   handbook... but it does profess to being correct in every detail.. since it is divinely inspired. Thus it can be useful as the tool to verify God exists.  One aspect of that is the reason there is an 'old' and 'new' testament... the old testament largely consisted of future predictions - such as those in Isaiah - the new testament was verification that these predictions came to pass.  These are discounted by people by claiming they were written after the fact.. though I think the dead sea scrolls show otherwise - and I believe the Bible's teachings were written even earlier than this - and passed in verbal form even further back.Also in many regards you can find on the   internet   long lists of Bible statements which were not common scientific knowledge at the time.. As is with all things.. people attack many of them on many levels... One such statement in the Bible is that the world is described as a circle..this was completely unknown at the time - those who discredit the statement point out that the hebrew word could also be translated as 'circuit' or 'compass'....though obviously that wouldn't make as much sense..'It is He who sits above the circle of the earth,And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers'that one is from Isaiah 40:22... and is old testament.. very ancient stuff. 740-680 b.c. is commonly held. The point being.. just when in history did we learn the earth was circular?  Around 300 years later Aristotle proposed the idea in his book 'on the heavens'.. but it wasn't accepted as a given.one nice example of Biblical 'science'''He [  god  ] hangs the earth on nothing''first off..this is from Job - and as I recall that was old testament stuff as well -definitely B.C. - which I believe is in the dead sea scrolls as well.. at the time people had various beliefs about the earth... whether it be it was on the backs of infinite turtles or the like... and many other views -. but the knowledge that the earth floats in space was not known as a fact.There are other examples.. and of course they can be debated on different levels.. one being the translation.. another being the date written.. and third the exact meaning implied..The point is not that the Bible should be used as a science handbook - it was never intended to be so..that was never it's intended purpose.  The point is that this 'primitive' text is consistent with science - and appears to be ahead of it's time from the things it points out, some of which would ironically be heresy at the time.  There's much more.. but I'm not going to list them all.. descriptions of the process of water evaporation and clouds.. things like that - which may sound unimpressive until you consider what people of the time commonly knew about weather.  Also.. scientists typically wonder why the Bible doesn't contain some more obvious reference.. like say to the DNA double helix.. or something similar.. though this would definitely be convenient -- it goes directly against God's purposes... as I mentioned to you before - it is necessary for God to maintain 'plausible deniability'.. a rough balance... he has to give enough evidence to support belief - yet not so much that it would make faith unnecessary - a mention of something such as DNA would clearly destroy this... (though I assume some still wouldn't believe... man's capacity for disbelief, especially these days, is amazing).as far as your question..Where does God get the   energy   to do so?..You are kidding right?

1," All animals share the same DNA, so we must be related, if you look at the evidence (something religious people don't do) you will see that there is more evidence for it than against it."

2," I'm voting no based on the title of the debate and it's relationship to the explanation.  /   /> Evolution is true, is a statement that would be (it's usually stated as Evolution is a fact) and is debated at length amongst learned people who accept the substantial volume of evidence that supports the theory of evolution.  />   /> These debates usually revolve around the scientific definitions of truth, fact and theory.  />   /> The explanation that a belief in evolution is based on it being a very logical explanation is not good enough to claim it as being true.  />   /> There have been many findings regarding evolution that are fact.

1,"Evolution has no implications for morality: it describes what has happened, making no judgement about whether what has happened is good: Non-religious ethicists are perfectly capable of making moral judgements, and they regularly do so.

That doesn't mean I don't have an answer... it just means it might not be correct... I'm flawed like everyone.”But they are the answers you have come to.  That makes the question of HOW you got to those valid in my book.  “As I already said.. the Bible is not meant to be a   science   handbook... but it does profess to being correct in every detail.. since it is divinely inspired.”Then it can be used to make accurate predictions of physical phenomena, because it is ‘correct in every detail’. “Thus it can be useful as the tool to verify God exists.

How did you, logically, come to that belief?“Also in many regards you can find on the   internet   long lists of Bible statements which were not common scientific knowledge at the time.. As is with all things.. people attack many of them on many levels... One such statement in the Bible is that the world is described as a circle..this was completely unknown at the time –“How so?  What is the verifiable age of that statement?  The circular nature of the Earth comes out quite easily when you start doing astronomy… it can be seen using very primitive tools (two wells positioned at different latitudes can be used to run rough calculations… which both the Egyptians and the Greeks did).  An interpretation of Vedic texts (from what is now India) that date to around the same time can also be interpreted as to a spherical Earth… in many ways it is clearer because it can be interpreted to indicate the sun moving around the Earth.""The [sun] never really sets or rises. In that they think of him “He is setting,” having reached the end of the day, he inverts himself; thus he makes evening below, day above. Again in that they think of him “He is rising in the morning,” having reached the end of the night he inverts himself; thus he makes day below, night above. He never sets; indeed he never sets.""	-Aitareya Brahmana vrs. 4.18“'It is He who sits above the circle of the Earth,And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers'”That is an observation that anyone who has stood on a high point can make… from a distance above you can see in a circle around you, and things do look smaller.  It is in no way contradictory to what anyone at that time could have understood, nor necessarily indicative of the Earth as a circle.The Earth is spherical after all, not a circle.  If the statement was translated as ‘above the sphere of the Earth’ then a case could be made."
2, It is very wrong we didn't evolve from apes

2, God created the world we did not evolve from monkeys- it's in the good book!!!!!!!!
2, The evolution that I believe in is not the kind you think.  I am a Christian an the evolution that I believe in is the kind like metamorphosis and things like that not the kind that we evolved from apes and space exploded and created the earth.
2, Evolutionist say we were boiling outer-space for a 84billion years in soup then bang we have earth                               RETARTED                 If evolution is real how come we can't take monkeys with us on airplanes??????????   Supposedly we evolved out of animals???????!!!!!!!!!!
2," I believe in evolution; evolution is the mechanism that some species of animals and plants use to adapt to certain circumstances do to the change. Because our planet is currently changing, some animals need to adapt to that, if they don't or are incapable then they can become extinct.  And It does exist there are animals who evolve from the dinosaurs age, like aligators, tortules and many others."
2," There are lots of proofs that show evolution is not at all a proper scientific law which can give a perfect explanation to human appearance. It is not at all hundred percent correct and thus it is not considered as a law. This theory of evolution fails to elucidate many things which are expected to be revealed by this theory. Apart from this evolution theory is not fully truthful. Thus after so many days it is still said to be a theory in lieu of law. The theory of natural selection, theory from Darwin did not succeed to give the proper enlightenment to this evolution theory. Those theories were sounding good but not 100% scientifically correct. This evolution theory can easily make a student to ask the logical base of this theory to his or her teacher. Only the teacher can avoid and nothing else."
2," I do agree that evolution is wrong in the sense that it does not explain or support our existence.  There are some great studies done to show that evolution is happening and that we have adapted to our surroundings.  But to me, that does not support evolution.  Evolution is a broad topic.  I have done quite a bit of research and have found that people who are looking for answers will find things to support their belief.  There is nothing that proves evolution 100%.  Sure there are some great scientists and some very smart people that have made claims based on their research that evolution is real.  But this is like someone wanting something so bad that they will go to any length to find evidence to support their belief.  Nobody wants to prove themselves wrong, so i think that the majority of evolutionists will search for things to back themselves up.  That is too easy and comfortable.  Until I see some absolute evidence that supports evolution, rather than one's theory, then i have to conclude that it is wrong and that we are part of something more powerful than we could ever fathom.  Besides, has evolution ever turned someones life around?  Has evolution ever impacted someone so much that they make steps in their life to improve and influence people in a positive and loving way?  Evidence to support something and faith in something are two different things.  If you have faith in something, you don't need an explanation of it's existence.  It's like the whole airplane thing.  I don't know how a big hunk of metal flies through the air to get me somewhere, i don't even think that should be possible.  But apparently it is, and I have experienced it.  And every time I get on a plane, i have faith, blind faith."

You have even stated that the phrases about ‘  stretching  ’ are describing the accelerating universe.   Thus the Bible can be used to determine new theories as well.  After all if scientists had paid more attention to the Bible then the accelerating universe would not have been a surprise to them (remember that an accelerating universe was not among the original three outcomes of our observations regarding the expanding universe).“The point is that this 'primitive' text is consistent with science - and appears to be ahead of it's time from the things it points out, some of which would ironically be heresy at the time.”Remember that scholars of that time knew that the Earth was round (it is surprisingly easy to prove really).  Indeed the Greeks were very close to showing that the Earth revolved around the sun, put off only because they had miscalculated the size of the universe (lacking telescopes they could not correctly calculate stellar distances using parallax)“descriptions of the process of water evaporation and clouds..”Which can easily be observed by the people at that time, Aristotle himself gave crude descriptions of cloud formation processes.“it goes directly against God's purposes... as I mentioned to you before - it is necessary for God to maintain 'plausible deniability'.. a rough balance... he has to give enough evidence to support belief - yet not so much that it would make faith unnecessary”What about all the stuff in the Old Testament?

2," Yes I believe the theory of evolution is wrong as there are no scientific facts about that. Every living thing on this earth is created by God with miracle. If we see creation of this universe then every single thing gives us the idea of the greatness of God. God first made Adam and Eve. Adam was the first human being and then the human race begins from there. If you think, how the first man was made then logic says that some creator has created the first man and He is God. Similarly is the case of every living thing on this earth. These creatures are created by God."
2," Yes, the theory of evolution is wrong, it got popular when Darwin wrote the book ""The Origin of Species"" but later on many scientists proved from several experiments that it is an incorrect theory.  />   /> Even if evolution is correct, then why have we not seen any change in known history? By just using your common sense you can see that evolution is a fake theory. Many scientists have also confessed it. For example, you can see the result in the modern science journals. One of these results is here, it is narrated in ""Science, vol. 207, 7 March 1980, p. 1103; A. J. Kelso, Physical Anthropology, 1st ed., J. B. Lipincott Co., New York, 1970, p. 221; M. D. Leakey, Olduvai Gorge, vol. 3, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1971, p. 272."" that by outlining the link chain as Australopithecus > Homo habilis > Homo erectus > Homo sapiens, evolutionists imply that each of these species is one another's ancestor. However, recent findings of paleoanthropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time.  />   /> So, you can see from above passage that scientists have themselves confessed, unconsciously, the right thing."
1," ""There is no scientist can give strong evidence to support evolution.""  /   /> Have you read the Origin of the Species?  I think you might find some evidence in there.  If you want strong evidence you could also have see some literature from any evolutionary biologist.  Richard Dawkins would be a start."
2,"Yes, God is by his nature - supernatural.  That's not an excuse.. It's a core concept.  So just by that nature some things are likely to not be measurable.. or have materialistic explanations.   Including 'where God got the   energy  ' to create the universe.  Although, possibly through   science   there may be a way to measure such a thing.. possibly it relates to dark matter.. and dark energy? But at this point I truly couldn't say.. and considering I'm not 'in the field' - I'd really have to depend on what is presented to us like most people.. and judge from the data.Many things would leave signs... often creationist's view the big bang with mixed feelings.. because in one hand it seems to confirm creation.. but also conflicts.   Even though I believe the big bang theory is flawed.. it does give an example of what I mean by signs.. - Then it comes down to comparing the biblical narrative with our scientific understanding..  To test what agrees..This is why the age of the earth and Genesis have received so much focus - although an old earth doesn't truly rule out the   bible  's authority - it does leave creationists with a genesis which is symbolic.. not literal.. You could still believe in God.. but the weight of the argument would be dramatically lessened.  Though geology feels it's an open and shut case... there are plenty of questions - if the Grand Canyon is the result of millions of years of erosion... where would the land from that erosion end up?  It doesn't appear to be there. - also why is the river that is claimed to have created it so drastically small in comparison... a catastrophic flood doesn't suffer from these types of problems.As far as the miracles of the Bible... including those of the life of Christ - these were necessary at the time for the purposes of that same 'plausible deniability' I spoke of.. it served to build God's case for believers.  I never said that God doesn't do miracles.. for that matter the reason I'm so positive of God's existence is through things which happened in my own life.  Since they are personal experiences they don't have weight with other people.. only for me.  It left nothing physical - no faces of Jesus in pancake batter.. or anything I can point to as an example.. But definitely in some cases in the past as well as currently God reveals himself in a way to some people which leaves no chance of denying..(but oddly enough.. there were those who witnessed these things that still didn't believe)  But generally speaking, parting the red sea.. and things of this nature occurred during biblical times and not now...  These things were deliberately done by God during a time period that proving them would be very difficult... yet there should be signs of them happening if we look.  To summarize.. it was necessary at one point in history for God to make himself more clearly known.. for him to take a more visibly active part in the world.What was known at that time in history is debatable.. like the earth being 'round'.  There were pockets of scholars at the time that had views on these things.. - but it's not as if they had a printing press.  Although really the point of mentioning a round world.. or a mentioning of the world hanging on nothing. (which seems to imply gravity to me... though the line is 'poetic' it is an accurate description.. it truly hangs on nothing)  but anyway.. the point of these lines is more that they do not disagree with science.. creation myths from different civilizations throughout time cannot make that claim - they often do disagree with known science .. matter of fact more often than they agree with it."

1," I believe Evolution is correct, and what's up with this lack of understanding that evolution is a sloooooooow process?   />   /> With the making everything is 6 days (and resting on the seventh) , which conveniently happens to be a week.

1," I believe its right. My scientific evidence is the fossil record, (You may look that up.) My religious belief is this... Pope Pius once said that, ""True science finds God behind every door"" This is saying that science is just mans way of explaining Gods workings. Evolution is creation. For all of you who want to disprove me by saying from the bible, God made the earth in six days and rested on the seventh; allow me to tell you what I believe with a verse from the bible too. It says something like this. The human life is like a vapor of smoke to God. This is saying that the 100 years of a human life is like a second to God. So seven days very well may have been billions of years."
1," If we weren't continually evolving, most of us  wouldn't be offended by the way the rest are degenerating.   /> When there are people going around beating up the elderly or murdering each other for the price of a six pack, and being rewarded instead of punished, there is no place to go than up.  /> But that might be what has to happen in order for mankind to achieve the next level of understanding."

1, They all kinds of evidence that evolution exists.  What are you suggesting?  That we were just here?
1," Evolution is just logic.  The individuals with better characteristics survive more often, so they are passed on.  This causes species to change, but not all at once, and because the others are not completely unfit for survival they survive as well."
1," HAHAHA there's always one that slips through the net.  Firstly, there's concrete evidence that we have evolved.  Secondly, if God did create everything, then we would have EVOLVED from what he made.  Darwin was a genius and a legend man!  /> Thirdly, don't take the bible literally.  If you believe in the Adam and Eve bullshit then more fool you.  That book contradicts itself more times than I've flicked a light switch.  It's not something that's supposed to be taken literally.   /> Anyone hoppin' on ma ark tomorrow..? ;)"
1," I remember bumping into a jehovah's witness and he was blabbing on about some bullshit that the earth is in a stage called its 'Last Days.' I seriously had to stifle a laugh. Then he went on to say how Darwin's theory of evolution is wrong because ""up until a certain era, there was no recorded forms of life and no fossil evidence, and afterwards, there was a sudden explosion of life. So God must exist to cause this"" (his words). I talked to my biology teacher and he says the reason for that was because they ""Before the period stated, all life had no form of rigid skeletal structure, because everything EVOLVED from ameobas."""
1," You don't need to ""believe"" in Evolution, you just need to understand it. Evolution is really the only of explaining the diversity of life, right now.  />   /> If the theory of evolution were to be proved false by a better theory (Just as Einstein's theory of Gravity replaced Newtons). Biologists would be more than happy to disregard it, in favor of the better theory.  />   /> Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"
2,"First of all, the Bible is not a   science   book. But what it does says about Gods creation is scientifically true. In science there is a first cause that is beyond direct observation. This is called the Unified Force. In   religion   the Unified Force is called God. Where did God get the   energy   to ""stretch out"" the universe? He didn't. He was the energy. "
1," You shouldn't just blindly repeat things you hear. There is actually far more evidence, and from many different fields, for the Theory of Evolution than there are for the Theories of Gravity, Relativity, or quantum mechanics. Yet all of these are far more accepted than evolution... People are strange."
1," Did you really just say that no scientist can support evolution?  The theory of evolution came about from scientific discovery, so your statement makes hardly any sense."
1," Evolution is the real deal. We have fossil evidence and DNA to strongly back it up. By using forensics, we can determine what happened in the past without having to physically be there. Like a detective. But there is no need to be threatened by Evolution. The theory does not eliminate God or Gods from the picture."
1," I believe there was some sort of evolution, but the question is what made that evolution take place.  I think some sort of higher being made it take place."
1," We have similar DNA to a cabbage, is that just because God was having a good joke with his angel mates...  />   /> This is a ridiculous debate, the evidence for Evolution completely outweighs the evidence for god, or any divine presence, or did god just plant all the different fossils in the ground for fun, like we do at zoos for children playing in the sand pit"
1, Evolution is true i'm a Christian but i'm not in denial ADAM AND EVE is a load of Sh**  / its probably meant to be symbolic and easy to understand for the people of the day (remember that was over 2000 years ago)
1," Evolution is completely true, Darwin hit the nail right on the head when he defined the theory of evolution and the survival of the fittest understanding. Fossils should be enough proof for everyone to see that evolution is true"
1," Evolution is simply the genetic change in populations of organisms over successive generations. So are you saying that you are genetically identical to your parents, your grandparents, and your neighbors? Exactly how and why these changes take place is subject to debate I suppose, but to suggest it does not exist is just denying the evidence of genetic diversity you see, with your own eyes, all around you every day."
1," Of course evolution is real, as someone said ""it is fact"" there is no arguing, and i find it really funny that people who agreed with someone on this side in saying evolution does not contradict god have actually put their comments on the for side its ridiculous, you cant deny something that's being proven,,,, and i know this isn't the side for it but, do i believe in god NO! And I'm the only one with any proof, unless you don't count the fact you cant see or hear and then have the excuse ""yeah but i have faith"" as proof  /> and one more things those of you that think we evolved from monkeys, its apes for a start and just because you are not a scientist and emencly intelligent like them and cannot understand the process don't make it any less true, so to some up EVOLUTION IS FACT weather god is real or not, maybe open your mind to the thought that evolution could be the answer to how and not why."
1," The theories of Evolution and Creationism are not mutually exclusive but are actually complimentary.  Simply put, Evolution explains the history of the human beings physical transformation over time, and Creationism explains the birth of the human soul and spirit.  (See the opening scene in the move ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" when the first monkey, in the presence of the great black monolith, gains the consciousness needed to crossover and become human in spirit.)   /> The book of Genesis was written in the literary form of allegory typical of its period and was never meant to be a scientific manual.  History tells us that science as an empirically studied discipline did not come into existence until the late the 18th century in Europe so to think that the Book of Genesis some 5000 years before should have included more scientific evidence is simply preposterous.  /> And despite all of the advances in science today, no one will ever find the fossilized remains of the human spirit in any rock.   Human beings would never have discovered the theory of evolution were it not for the gift of intellectual consciousness which uniquely distinguishes us from all other species.     /> For those then who believe only in Evolution, life is but a scientific accident, a metaphysical mistake.  For those who believe only in Creationism, life is just magic.  Given the choice between ""magic"" or a ""mistake"", I choose Purpose."
1,"Science can never conclusively prove that there is no God (unless proof of another   god   is somehow found)... so it is always 'possible' to push the 'God did it' into those gaps in our knowledge.  However Science has consistently pushed into those areas where it was formerly declared 'God did it'The forces behind the creation of the cosmos do not care in the least for the actions of humans, lumps of self amusing, self replicating proteins sandwiched between layers of clay, that we are. "
1," Mate. If you want to play this game then eat this: There's no proof for God either. Don't give me any rubbish ""Can you get a car without a car maker"". There's more proof FOR evolution than God. Ever played Chinese whispers? In my view the bible and that game have a lot in common"
1," Can we get one thing straight. Evolution is fact. A theory in science, is an explanation for observations, and you cannot deny that evolution has taken place over the last millions of years. One thing no-one can say for sure is the driving force behind evolution, it could be down to a supreme deity, but evolution is fact, and it is in no way wrong."
1," The simplest way to prove it is this.  The next time  you get an infection and the doctor gives you 10 days of antibiotics, take them for 5 days, then stop.  The only remaining bacteria will be the strongest ones that could survive 5 days of pounding from the antibiotics.  These 'superbugs' will then multiply, and instead of a mediocre infection, you now have a antibiotic resistant microbial community which you cannot get rid of.  Evolution in a week.  PS: DON'T do this."
1," I am a Christian, and I do believe in evolution because there are quite an amount of amazing proofs for it. Evolution does not contradict the idea of God's creation, since the Bible employs metaphorical descriptions and it is very possible that the ""days"" are not actually days, but million of years."
1," Well, to begin with, there is a lot of strong evidence to support evolution: The discovery of DNA, the discovery of fossils and primitive primates etc.  /> And okay, there is no DEFINITIVE evidence for evolution, but there is not definitive evidence for any other theory of creation either."
1, I definitely think it has something to do with everything as there is quite a lot of evidence for it (e.g different skulls show steady progress as do certain fossils) and I personally find it difficult to see how anything could survive in the constantly changing world without it.
1," ""No scientist can give strong evidence to support evolution""?  /   /> Your dishonesty and ignorance of science proves you are not fit to even ask the question.  />   /> The big bang, abiogenesis and evolution were ALL produced by the same methodology that produced cars, televisions, computers, and doctors.  To reject evolution requires rejecting all the modern benefits of science as well.  Taking the benefits (e.g. Reading this on the Internet) while rejecting evolution is moral cowardice and hypocrisy of the worst sort.  />   /> Edit:   />   /> Dishonest arguments do not deserve respect or ""nice words"".  They deserve to be exposed for the lies they are, and as long as I don't use profanity or insults, I won't retract them.  The facts will stand up for themselves - he has none, and he is wilfully ignorant of the facts."
1," There's really no way yet to prove it, BUT the precedence of the evolution of all other species including our own has led to a conclusion that we MOST LIKELY came from something else. We have evolved over the years, but what we started out as is still a mystery because we have no proof yet to claim evidence of our beginnings either way (creation or evolution)."
1," As far as evolution, god, and the creation of man is concerned, maybe evolution is an explanation of how and not why. Maybe god does exist and he set things in motion and evolution took over after that. If you argue that ""it says in the bible god created man, period"" then how do you explain the fact that we don't see human remains in the same sedimentary layers as many of the dinosaurs. If you want to believe the bible, fine. But you cant pick and choose what parts of the bible to abide by. If you believe in a book written by a bunch of ""translators"" for king james which contradicts itself about a million times, then you are as delusional as the bible you thump."
1," As a general common sense rule you really shouldn't get into a debate against Evolution unless you have some basic understanding of the process of Evolution. Otherwise, you make false statements and use worn out phrases that creationist have used for years to run-down evolution. For the most part creationist deny evolution because it contradicts what they believe, so they choose not to even begin to understand evolution."
2,"  Intelligent design does have merit. However it maybe usefulto use clearer terms then, ""intelligent design"". (Designed with for knowledge of purpose), is much more to the point.   Macro Evolution is all about, problem solving mechanisms, spontaneously generating.    It is difficult, even improbable to imagine how such a process could happen; without being jump started. There are as many opposing forces in the environment as there are beneficial. How could, fragile, non-evolved life, survive in a hostile environment? Further, what would cause successfuldesigns to leave one environment, for a totally alien environments? Sea life too land life.  There would be nothing that would lead a successful species, to make such a drastic move from one environment to a totally alien one, and fill the earth. Unless we view the environment as an intelligent entity.. IF such change was forced upon a species by catastrophic events, the species would become extinct; before random mutation, could find the correct body designs, to allow survival. So not only is the survival of the first life improbable, without pre-designed survival mechanisms. Life evolving  drastic body plan changes, to survive in totally different environments. Is also unlikely to have happened.    I don't believe an honest mind could conclude this happened incrementally over eons of time. No matter how much time is involved, because with that idea, your always putting the cart before the horse. The designed (cart) can be pulled by the environment (horse). But a horsecannot build a cart. Neither can it change a cart into a boat or airplane.The mindless environment can't do anything, without a pre-designed mechanism. We don't see the environment incubating new life,  or totally new body plans today. Why would we conclude it only happened in the past;in a even more hostel environment?!"
1," I find it relevant to point out that the answers in the ""AGAINST: Evolution Is Wrong"" Column are nearly twice as long as those in the ""FOR: Evolution Is Wrong"". This, despite the fact that nearly the debate is actually very close in terms of numbers on each side.  />   /> I would suggest the reason for this is that those who support Evolution have detailed positions based on numerous supporting FACTS. And those who oppose Evolution have relatively brief positions based on few supporting OPINIONS."
1, It can't  be wrong!!! This is something natural!!
1," Evolution is defined in Wikipedia as ""a change in the inherited traits of a population from one generation to the next"". You refer to the scientific model of evolution which is based on biology - can't see why everyone's jumped on the religion bandwagon by assuming that you are talking about Darwin's Theory of Evolution. So no I disagree that ""evolution"" is bad - and if you believe that it is bad why are you using the Internet rather than reverting to the ""unevolved"" practices of our ancestors?"
1," Well evolution is by far the most logical idea I have heard about where man came from.....I mean it could be worse people could tell you that man and woman started off naked in a garden with nothing but an apple tree and a talking snake for company,...LOL how ludicrous is that?  The theory of evolution wins every time!"
1," Scientists can present a great deal more evidence for evolution (various fossils in chronological order clearly showing an evolving skeletal structure) than a Christian can present for intelligent design (none). Therefore, until I see some real evidence for intelligent design, evolution is the most likely culprit for my existence."
1," Well, as being one of the denoted tie breakers of this debating conversation topic, I would like to point out that Evolution is both a fact and a theory. While on this particular topic, I‚Äôd like to cover the definition of the word ‚Äútheory‚Äù briefly. The word theory, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty. By its definition it means ‚Äúa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena‚Äù. On another topic of discussion, I would like to point out, for those who say that evolution cannot be proven, that nothing in the real world can be proven with absolute certainty (since no one will ever know everything there is to know about anything). However, high degrees of certainty can be reached. In the case of evolution, we have huge amounts of data from diverse fields. The following are some of the phenomena involved.  />   /> All of the information listed below is fact:  />   /> -Life appeared on earth more than two billion years ago;   /> -Life forms have changed and diversified over life‚Äôs history;   /> -Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors;   /> -Natural selection is a significant factor affecting how species change.  />   /> Evolution has explained many other facts concerning similar aspects as well (of which I will reference to should I be asked to). The theory of evolution has also proved itself in practice. It has useful applications in epidemiology, pest control, drug discovery, and other areas. Furthermore, if the claim of ‚Äúit‚Äôs only a theory‚Äù were a real objection, creationists would also be issuing disclaimers complaining about the theory of gravity, atomic theory, the germ theory of disease, and the theory of limits (on which calculus is based). The theory of evolution is no less valid than any of the theories given above. So why aren‚Äôt the ones complaining about the Evolutionary Theory also complaining in separate debating topics about why we shouldn't accept the existence of gravity, since it‚Äôs only a theory? Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact."
1," Why is it that when you try to look at the theory of evolution that it comes down to a god thing ?  />   /> As far as I am aware evolution has been tested,  proven, and those conditions reproduced.. The criteria for scientific acceptance..  />   /> Those of you that have such faith in god, I can not understand why your faith can not stretch to the wonder of evolution, that is one amazing process, whoever thought of that ? ;-)"
1," I think you will find that there is a vast amount of evidence for evolution if you would care to look. In fact, as scientific theories go, evolution stands out as being one of the most supported theories in existence, this is evident since it has fought off decades of scrutiny and is still accepted by biologists today - more so than ever. As i say, take the time to look and you will find. Also, i don't see much evidence being provided by the other camp."
1," Being an atheist in a catholic school i can tell you that Catholicism, or Christianity does not dispel the idea of evolution. It says that you are free to accept as long as you understand two things,  /> The Book of Genesis is not literal, and so the 7 days could represent hundreds of millions of years,  /> and that God is behind evolution in its stem of creation."
1," You have to consider the alternative explanations for our existence and the evidence for and against each - oh, by the way, 2000 year long consensus doesn't count as evidence!  />   /> I don't think there's any need to go too deeply into the evidence for evolution by natural selection, but as most people will know, there is some (although controversially scarce) evidence in the fossil records for common ancestry, as well as similarities of existing species physiological and genetic makeup.    />   /> Geographical distribution of species is also worth consideration (this is also evidently apparent in human racial distinction throughout the world - I can't quite understand a Gods reasoning in creating a peaceful world by segregating us through racial differences!).    />   /> Evolutionary psychology is also worth investigating, as it suggests that our behaviour can be explained through our need to survive and reproduce in our evolutionary past, and it is surprisingly convincing (depending on what book you read!).  But as Richard Dawkins says; if you can't understand how a physiological or psychological trait could have been created through natural selection, it means you're not trying hard enough!'.  />   /> For those who say that there is no evidence that evolution exists in our own lifetime, the fact is that evolution by natural selection in such complex organisms as ourselves can take tens of thousands of generations for its effects to become obviously apparent to us.    />   /> However, for micro-organisms (such as viruses that can reproduce relatively quickly) we are all witness to the effects of evolution by natural selection.  As particular species of a virus evolves in various host cells, they are battling with an organisms immune system for survival.  This is survival of the fittest at the microscopic level!  And I can't see any reason why this would not occur at the macroscopic level.  As I explained before, other evidence also points in this direction."
1,"Jumpstart helps us understand the eliminative nature of ID--It is difficult, even improbable to imagine how such a process could happen; without being jump started. --In other words, his lack of imagination or familiarity with science causes him to propose the need for a designer.Ignorance is a powerful foundation for ID causing it to remain scientifically irrelevant.PS: Contrary to his musings, selection and variation are highly plausible, all that is needed is variation, inheritance and a fitness difference. And while science may not have all the answers to origin of life, it has done far more science in this area to resolve this than ID could even dream of.Ah the power of ignorance."
1," I think evolution is a far better explanation than the idea that the world is 5000 years old and there's a guy-in-the-sky. Like most scientific theories is not 100% defensible, but on a balance of probabilities, it is the most likely scenario.   />   /> The problem with this debate is that it falls easily into a debate on the existence of God. It is important to note that Evolution could be wrong or right whether God exists or not - in other words, the two arguments, while related, are not identical. Furthermore, an argument on God's existence fails often because it is an argument where one side brings arguments based on logic, whereas the other relies on feelings and more esoteric ""reasoning"". Evolution is simply a scientific theory and there is no reason why the counterarguments to Evolution shouldn't be scientific.  />   /> While I concede that Evolution theory may be false, at least in some minute details, overall is, in my view, the best and most convincing theory we have to explain our world. That is why I accept it."
1," Genetic tests have proven that we are very closely related to certain apes- a branch on the same family tree. A proven fact is just that, a fact, and isn't ""wrong."""
1," Evolution is a theory that is supported at the micro level.  The macro level of evolution has a long way to go to provide proof, but there is enough work going on in this subject that links can eventually be found.  Creationism is also a theory based on faith, yes there are some historical evidence of links to the stories within the Bible, but that only proves that the Bible has some historical value and does not prove the Creationism theory."
1," This is pure ignorance.  Yes evolution is a theory which is more than I can say for any religious pretext for how we have all come to be.   If you actually read scientific papers about evolution they do not claim to be law because it is still a working theory.  Up to this point evolution is the best explanation for how we are here.  You are entitled to your religious beliefs but religion is based on faith and science is based on fact, and the facts are definitely not on your side."
1," I really do not know where to start with this one, at the time of writing this response apparently evolution is incorrect. I quote ""There is no scientist can give strong evidence to support evolution.""  every recognized scientist in existence could give you evidence of evolution by looking at any living thing. The evidence for evolution is all around us, it does however require you to think in different dimensions of time which can be hard to imagine.   />   /> FoxFire makes a great argument for evolution and natural selection. I am an agnostic, but there is no reason you cannot believe in god and evolution, the two are compatible. Its really only the people who take everything in the bible literally, the fundamentalists who cannot find a place for god and evolution."
1, Has anyone got a more rational explanation?
1," And what proof do you have for intelligent design?  /   /> Microevolution is indisputable. The evidence is clear.  /> Moving on...  />   /> As for macroevolution, most of you clearly don't fully understand evolution. You wouldn't have a semi-formed liver. You'd have an organ with a similar function that would gradually gain and lose attributes until it turned into a liver.  /> Any of you who are thinking that natural selection doesn't explain it, natural selection isn't all there is to evolution. Genetic drift and mutations also function in, among other things.  /> Also, most scientists no longer believe that we evolved from cavemen or whatever.

1," People who believe that god created the earth keep saying that they got this from the bible. History says that the bible was written by a few profits that claimed to hear the voice of god. All the bible is, is a book written by some guys who heard some voices in their heads, and people today are making judgments by that writing without any evidence to support those judgements. Evolution however does have evidence."
1," I believe in evolution. I also believe in God. So how do I answer the question presented by either side? The evolutionists state that there is unequivocal evidence of life before man. Their right! The evangelical Christians believe in the literal translations of the Bible that God made the heavens and earth in six days. Their right too! How can both be right? My answer is that God's clock is not our clock. Our day is one revolution of the earth, God's day is something much different."
2,How did life begin? 
1," ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution."" - Theodosius Dobzhansky  /   /> Those who refuse to accept the overwhelming amount of evidence for evolution are either ignorant of the subject matter or religiously delusional."
1," I definitely agree with evolution. So does the vast majority of the scientific community. And you know what? If one person wants to believe that god helped with evolution, that's fine. I don't care. As long as they can accept that evolution happened, and does not turn a blind to the blaring evidence.  />   /> On this website I've come across a couple people saying how there are flaws within Darwin's theory. Of course there were! It was the first time anything like that had been submitted! But then there was Wallace, lamark, then there was Eldredge and Gould (punctuated equilibrium) and hundreds of scientists since the 1860's who have taken Darwin's theory and tweaked and changed and improved bits of it. The idea to go into the nittygrittys of The Origin Of Species looking for places where things may be false is ridiculous. When John Dalton made his atomic theory it was brilliant at the time. Today we know only 3 of his 4 points were correct, but it doesn't matter. Darwin had the right idea and scientists after him have researched it further."
1," WHAT! This is pointless!! First off if there wasn't evolution the diseases we have today wouldn't be as strong as they are! And there wouldn't be humans! Everything starts somewhere and evolves!  /> Notice that almost all forms of complex life have both male and female--horses, cats, dogs, humans, moths, monkeys, fish, elephants, etc. The male needs the female to reproduce, and female needs the male to reproduce. One cannot carry on life without the other. Which then came first according to the evolutionary theory? If the males came before the females, how did the males of each species appear without the females? If you believe that perhaps, maybe, probably, possibly, male and female evolved over a long period of time, what then made evolution change its initial plan and require the necessity of male and female? There is another little problem for evolutionists. Did the first fish that crawled onto dry land millions of years ago have lungs or gills? If he had gills, he would have gasped and died the moment he crawled onto dry land. If he had lungs, why did he evolve them while he was in the ocean? Also, he had to find a female (to carry on the species) who had also crawled onto the land, and she would have had to have evolved lungs also. Would you remotely consider the possibility that the Bible is right when it says that God created male and female? Why do you prefer to choose to believe a ridiculous theory than believe the truth with so much evidence around you? Is it because the Bible has moral dictates you disagree with?"
1," There are documented CASES of specific species adapting over time. Whether or not you agree that God is the cause of this change, you must agree that there WAS a change, and that evolution occurred to keep a certain species alive."
1," I think  the case against evolution is wrong and misinformed.  / How can the arguments for evolution necessarily dismiss the idea of a God?  /> Why can't God and evolution be compatible. Possibly God designed things to include a long evolutionary process?  /> Because early hominids were not necessarily related to and evolved from each other doesn't dismiss the case for evolution. Many species died out because they couldn't compete with rivals for food and other resources and that argues for evolution of the strongest, more intelligent and resourceful. Sometimes they died out because of climatic changes in the areas they lived in.  /> Fossils can detect patterns in evolutionary change and development. They show growth patterns.  /> Evolutionary theory can help to predict that related organisms do share similarities and evolution can be seen at this micro-scale.  /> We've seen many changes in known history and in pre-history and too many to argue against.  /> The whole evolutionary process for hominids is too complicated to argue here and is wrongfully discussed in the opposing views."

1," Actually, most leading scientists nowadays support evolution, and of course it's going to have massive holes in it: That's what makes it a theory.  As with most theories, Darwin was not the only one to hook onto the idea - there was also Wallace, Lamarck and several others around that time. And there are masses of evidence for the theory of evolution. You shouldn't immediately dismiss it because it states in a religious book that God created everything in seven days with the click of his fingers, which is an insupportable idea. Besides, many Christian priests have accepted that God created us through evolution :D As for the question 'Even if evolution is correct, why have we not seen any change since the known history?' Have you been living in a cave? Switch over to the UKTV Documentary once in a while. You'll find that species are changing and forming all the time as changes in the environment force them to. You have to understand adaptation before you debate evolution."
1," Well maybe there are some mistakes in the theory but as a whole concept is quite right and logical, no?"
1, Of course they're nonsense.  Theistic evolution is nonsense for the same reason. :)
1, I see the creation story as one perspective from one group of people...the Hebrews.  Full of metaphor.   To suggest that this is about the first humans is silly and a waste of people's time to dwell on it.
1,"Saying there are experts on Intelligent Design is like saying there are experts on astrology.ID is a pseudoscience.  The best definition of pseudoscience comes from Prof. Thagard at the univ. of Wisconsin.""A theory or discipline which purports to be scientific is pseudoscientific if and only if:1. it has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; but2. the community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in ralation to others, and is selective in considering confirmation and disconfirmations.""    http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/PH29A/thagard.html    "
1," I interpret the creation story as a metaphor; with Science as HOW God made humans. Humans at the time may have been unable to comprehend the complexities of science, and therefore the Bible had it written the way it does now.   />   /> But hey, take it whatever way you want to. People can't force you into thinking certain ways.."
2," Then again, I often wondered as a child why and how the whole universe was created in the first place."
2, Evidence indicating Intelligent Design is abundant and overwhelming.
2," Granted creationism is not provable through the use of the scientific method.  This does not mean it is false.  Evolution (life arising from nonlife or nothingness) is also not provable through the scientific method.  Both are speculation on the part of the person that believes them to be true.    />   /> And haters, don't bother commenting on how science has proven evolution through the fossil record or the fact that species change through natural selection because neither of those contradict creationism."
2, Creationism is mythology and intelligent design is a politically based movement to secure the support of a certain segment of the population. Not nonsense just nothing particularly to do with the truth.
2," I don't attempt to defend either intelligent design or creationism....However:  / Here is the problem with science: It is completely ill equipped to answer any questions of ascribing meaning.  Those of science cannot answer the question of why we are here.  There is no measurement or experiment that science has that can address this.  Because there is no ability to answer why, they say there is no why.  Those of faith use elements that are also outside the domain of science to answer their questions.  Through morality, love, virtues, evils etc. Life has meaning, and is elevated.    />   /> Making sense of life and of why we exist is not nonsense at all.  Personally, i find those questions of far greater depth, than all the hows.  Science in the end (for me) is less intellectually satisfying than theology and philosophy."

2," You know a debate like this can be put up to get intelligent information exchange. Obviously, it triggers some people inner child too much and all they can do is try to put people down. It's a shame, I came to this site to express my opinion and hear others GOOD opinions. Hizashi usually doesn't let me down. That can't be said for dog boy or ibanex and a few other. They should go back to playing with toys, I'll find a more intelligent site."
2," Yes, if what you are saying is true, then I'm for it.   / But evolution has been a bag-full of lies from the beginning anyways."
1,"What always gets me with the Intelligent Design crowd is that, in their aim of inserting an external designer into the mix of biological science, they seem to miss or deliberately avoid one glaring fact - once life exists, with varying degrees of success, life designs itself according to the rules established by its environment and its own specific nature. Life needs no external designer. It has the power to design itself over time. Each of us is the design - conscious or not - of our two parents, or rather, of the egg and sperm that joined to create us. Some chance and some decision-making, some design is involved. Our parents, in turn, are the chance and deliberate design of their parents before them and so on. We purposely select our mates and the environment determines whether our coupling is successful or not. No matter the species, a great amount of examination and decision-making is involved one generation to the next. That is design, however, it is life designing life.Of course, how life first appeared is a separate issue. Nevertheless, knowledge of exactly what happened is not the same as mere supposition. Hard objective science will provide the answers to our questions. Supposition remains mere supposition unless it is followed by indisputable facts. Could the basic blocks for life been externally inserted upon the Earth by intelligent beings? Perhaps, however, before one intends to teach such as knowledge, it must be more than mere imagination. If the evidence substantially supports such a proposition, then, by all means, integrate it into ""what we know"" and relate such knowledge to children so that they too will have your understanding. If one's imagination remains mere imagination without substantiation by objective facts, then do not behave criminally by relaying it to children as knowledge when it is clearly not."
1," No, it is not falling apart.  Your statement is just worthless  penny-stock church rhetoric."
1," This sounds like religious faith speaking... Evolution grows more established literally every day. Just a few weeks ago they found the best transitional fossil yet, a creature with both reptile and amphibian features. Gene studies actually back up every claim darwinism makes and in fact make it easier to track evolutionary change over time.  And quantum physics doesn't affect evolution at all as far as I can tell... Evolution follows the rules of the atomic level, QM the rules of the subatomic level. And while they may be different rules, obviously the 2 systems are linked somehow or we'd all just fly apart."
1, Evolution is one of the most strongly supported theories in all of science. It is nowhere near a theory in crisis. Quantum Physics and DNA research do not harm evolution in the least. I honestly have no idea where you‚Äôre getting this information from. I suppose next we‚Äôre going to see a debate speaking about how the theory of gravity will soon be rejected as well.
1," Despite every lie told be cretins - I mean, creationists - like you, nothing has been shown that contradicts the theory of evolution.  One of two things always happens:  />   /> 1) The theory makes predictions, and new evidence found fits the theory.  />   /> 2) Rarely, new evidence is found that does not fit the theory, so the theory is changed to fit the evidence. Croutonist - I mean, creationists - ignore evidence that doesn't fit their claims, which is an act of pure cowardice as well as intellectual dishonesty."
1, No it isn't. It's BEEN falling apart is more like it.
1," No, it isn't. As far as I can tell the evidence is getting stronger."
1," Nope, not remotely.  In fact, evolution remains one of the single best supported theories in all of science and while recent discoveries may have altered our understanding of evolution somewhat, it hasn't demonstrated in any way, shape or form that evolution did not and does not occur."
1," Nope, just the opposite.   /   /> I'll talk about both Quantum Physics and DNA research. Quantum physics is a complicated subject, I've studied it for years and still don't completely understand it. One thing I do know is that Quantum physics has absolutely nothing to do with Evolution, Evolution has to do with Biology. In physics, Quantum mechanics is a physical science dealing with the behavior of matter and energy on the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.   />   /> Everything that has been found in the fossil record and in DNA seems to confirm that evolution has happened in the past, it is happening now and will continue to happen in the future."
1," It's not falling apart its evolving as new data arrives. That‚Äôs what logical people do in the face of new information. What would be really ridiculous is to take one set of ideas invented by a bunch of superstitious tribesmen 2000 years ago and refuse to credit any new thoughts, philosophies, or sciences developed since."
1, People like you should be banned from this website. I'm not even going to try and penetrate your thick skull. That's all I am going to say.
1,"Creationism makes a false historical/scientific claim that is detached from the broader precepts of belief in God. The belief that God creates and sustains the world is not the same as the belief that God created the world in seven days a few thousand years ago. The former is a theological position which implies the goodness and sovereignty of God, and his continuing involvement with his creation, not a scientific claim. The latter is an empirically testable claim which has been empirically tested and found to be false. We should not allow schools to teach our children things that are just plain wrong, and known to be wrong. This is distinct from allowing the teaching of religion, which is culturally and historically significant and which involves beliefs which are in principle distinct from science.
"
2,"This is the age old question.  This has been the battle of philosophers for all of time.  Great minds have struggled with it.  Nations have died fighting over it.  Are we created or an accident?  Are we machines choosing between incorrect and correct responses, or are we sentient being choosing between good and evil?  How could you not teach this? "
2," There is positive evidence against macroevolution.  / Whether or not evidence convinces anyone is irrelevant, it just has to be real and demonstrable. Some of the atheotards around here will never accept any evidence of any kind that disagrees with their aetheist beliefs, that doesn't mean that the evidence isn't factually real, only that they carry a ridiculous bias."
2," There is eye witness, reproducable evidence for ""micro"" evolution or change within a species which is irrefutable. However, the goo to you via the zoo evolution or ""macro"" evolution is a theory with way to many holes in it to be considered plausable. 1) macro evolution cannot explain first life, or how non-intelligent lifeless matter through nature (which by nature randomizes) could have created the first life which we now know thru DNA and protien sequences had a highly intelligent and spacific design. Creation or intelligent design theory fits perfectly. 2)macro evolution cannot explain the viability of transitional forms. In other words how could a half lizard half bird survive. Creation/intelligent design doesn't need this step. And the fossil record is proof for creation/ID and completely against evolution. The fossil record shows all life came into existance all at once and fully formed sometime between 600millionBC and 500millionBC. (life's big bang) there have been NO fossils that have shown ANY transitional forms, much less viable transitional forms... Micro evolution yes, girraffes necks might have grown longer over time to better enable them to reach tree branches, a cheetah's sense of sight and smell could have developed over time to make him a better hunter, and humans might have less body hair than our ancestors thanks to airconditioning/heating and the fact we now live indoors and wear more cloths. But a girraffe is still a girraffe, and a cheetah is still a cheetah and a human is still a human. Sharks have been the same since the time of the dinasours with little or no change....Macro evolution not plausable."
2," I don't believe in evolution, or anything contemporary beyond the dictionary definition of it. But one thing many non evolutionists need to believe is, that most evolutionists have way too many ways of defining evolution. First there is periodic evolution, then a gradual changing species, or even a change in genetic DNA(not mutation but simple reproduction). The DNA example can be something as insignificant as my parents made me and that is sufficient enough as proof as I am a byproduct of evolution. Any way you flip it, the hard result is that I am still a human being. Not evolving too fast, eh? I think we need to better define what is evolving and how other than the use of pictographs and stuff. It makes it hard to argue because I believe in Creationism (not trying to through religion into the argument.) And I am trying to be as respectable to evolutionists and am eagerly awaiting opinions."
2," There is absolutely no proof for Evolution. Despite the fact that Darwin is hailed as a genius in much of the scientific community, there are many holes in his theory. Darwin himself stated that if it was proven that an organism could not have come to exist through slight, successive changes over a long period of time, (in other words, if an organism was shown to be Irreducibly Complex) then his theory would fall apart. Irreducible Complexity has been proven with the example of the Flagella Motor, an extremely intricate system which requires all parts of itself to exist together in order to function."
2, I didn't see it so it cant be true
2, I have repeatedly asked for proof on this site and have yet to be supplied with any real proof.  I'm still up for it if there are any takers.
2, Evolution is just an excuse for biology to occupy the adolescent young mind.
1," Go read ""On the Origin of Species""...  /   /> I need not make a point of my own!"
1, If you wanted to start an actual debate you should have said there is no ‚Äòconvincing‚Äô evidence. Because the simple fact of the matter is that there is more evidence than you could examine in several lifetimes of study. The question is whether you agree in the interpretation of the evidence. It is your privilege if you wish to disagree with those that know and understand vast amounts more than you do on the subject.
1," Wow. Do you really think that a theory with NO evidence would be as widely recognized in the science world (and the rest of the world as well)? That doesn't make any sense.  There's a lot of evidence, I'm just not going to give examples because that would take a long time.  But really, how would such a  controversial theory (especially at the time it was proposed) get as far as it did with no evidence?"
1,"--OasthadAre we machines choosing between incorrect and correct responses, or are we sentient being choosing between good and evil? How could you not teach this?--That's a good topic for sunday school. As far as I can tell, this is part of the message they are teaching.What more do you want"
1," Evolution is STILL happening.. Viruses evolve constantly to not be ""killed off"" by antibiotics, which is why we have to constantly change the antibiotics. Everything evolves currently. Even humans.....the average height of a grown man in 1800 was a lot shorter than that of a man today.Evolution. I could go on for days about the proof.

1, I think you'll find there is. And rather a lot of it too.

1," Who enters into a scientific debate about evolution asking only for opinions? Are you serious? Forget opinions. This is science we‚Äôre talking about, not political controversies concerning presidential candidates. My bet is that you probably don‚Äôt know hardly anything about evolution to begin with. With that being said, I‚Äôll ask you a simply question before proceeding any further in such a debate. In layman‚Äôs terms, what does evolutionary theory postulate? If you can answer this question correctly, I‚Äôll go on to show you some evidence for the theory."
1," Wrong - evolution is probably the most supported theory in biology - it's withstood considerable scrutiny for the past 150 years and is as strong as ever.  />   /> Anyone who doesn't agree is one of two things - a liar or plain ignorant (willfully or otherwise). The evidence is readily available to all but the problem is that people will only read stuff that backs up their pre-concieved beliefs, which only reinforces their ignorant beliefs.   />   /> It's incredible how many people will use arguments against evolution that have been thoroughly refuted over, and over again."
1," If your trying to find evidence in the Bible, your right.....of course, the Bible wasn't written to make evolutionist happy, it just supplies about 2 pages to creation. If God had thought it a more important subject, I'm sure He(she) would have told you more. But the Bible was written to tell people how to live a better life, here and how to fit in, in heaven.  />      If you know anything about Quantum Physics, you know that things change and you believe and look for them....that's where you're evidence will be found.....like the Bible said 5000 years ago,  ""believe and then you will see""  />      A person with a closed or filled mind, doesn't have room to learn anything......especially the truth."
1, God is just an imaginary friend for adults
1,"ID is offered as an explanation for the complexity of life on Earth, which, according to ID proponents, cannot be explained by random chance and survival of the fittest.  But ID suffers a fatal flaw.  If we have to hypothesize an intelligent designer to explain life, then we need to hypothesize another intelligent designer to explain that intelligent designer, which also could not have come about from random chance.  We then need to explain the second intelligent designer with a third, and so on ad infinitum.  There are only two ways to end this infinite regression. First we could accept that intelligence and complex life CAN come about by random chance, and that the first intelligent designer in this regression did exactly that.  But if we do this, then why not just accept that WE came about by random chance and avoid the need for any regression?  Second, we could hypothesize a supernatural god that did not need to be designed by a previous intelligent designer (maybe god is a self-designing designer?).  But if we do this, then ID clearly becomes a religious argument, something ID proponents in this debate have denied. At this point no one can explain how life/intelligence formed on this planet.  But human ignorance does not constitute evidence for an even more complex and inexplicable intelligence.  Just because we can't explain something doesn't mean it can not be explained.  Sid"

However there are some examples of evidence based arguments for the existence of God the creator as opposed to anything else. Any example is the red-shift observation that the universe is expanding at an ever slowing rate. It is the logical (as science has noted) that the universe therefore came at one point from a single spot, and the question must arise of how something can exist from nothing. Whilst this is somewhat tenous, and not entirely evidence for earth based creationism, I think it is valid.  />   /> Further to my response, but unrelated to this topic, do please comment on my debut in new debates:  />   /> Http://www.forandagainst.com/Debates_Should_Have_A_Neutral_Column"

1,"On Pandasthumb, Nick Matzke, whose contributions to Dover v Kitzmiller were instrumental in the stunning defeat of Intelligent Design and whose contributions to exposing the fallacies in Behe''s arguments as well as the extent of ignorance of science amongst ID proponents has caused much concern amongst ID proponents, so much that in general they have chosen to pretend, in a typical creationist fashion, that Matzke's arguments do not exist. In this example, Matzke shows how Luskin's attempts to rebut the Kitzmiller decision by exposing the scientific vacuity of ID, once again backfire in light of the current state of scientific knowledge.   http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/09/luskin-and-the-2.html   Nick Matzke:Over on the opposingviews.com website, Casey Luskin of the DI tries to rebut the Kitzmiller decision by re-fighting Behe’s spectacular implosion on the issue of the evolution of the vertebrate immune system. To review, in his 1996 book Darwin’s Black Box, Behe claimed that:--Behe    “As scientists we yearn to understand how this magnificent mechanism came to be, but the complexity of the system dooms all Darwinian explanations to frustruation.” (Darwin’s Black Box, p. 139)    “We can look high or we can look low, in books or in journals, but the result is the same. The scientific literature has no answers to the question of the origin of the immune system.” (Darwin’s Black Box, p. 138)--(PvM: Note how these are the typical ID arguments against science, we do not know, thus designed)As the debate over “irreducible complexity” developed in the next decade, the most detailed arguments would go basically like this:--    ID: Gradual evolution by natural selection can’t produce IC structures because any structure missing a part would be nonfunctional    Evo: You are ignoring cooption of structures with different functions, which has a been a major feature of the evolutionary explanation of complex structures ever since the Origin of Species.    ID: Cooption explanations are too improbable.    Evo: Why?    ID: Because we say so.    Evo: But homology evidence shows that “IC systems” lacking parts can still have other functions, and therefore your claim that structures missing parts would be nonfunctional is wrong    ID: OK well I don’t have a comeback on that point, so instead I will claim that evolutionary cooption explanations aren’t detailed & tested enough to satisfy me.    Evo: Here’s a bunch of detailed & tested research papers on the evolution of system X.    ID: Not detailed enough. I need every single mutation & selection pressure before I admit that evolution produced this IC system rather than ID.--At this point the ID proponent has abandoned the original argument and therefore lost, even though he won’t admit it. Knowing all of this before the Kitzmiller trial, we devised ways to bring this point to the attention of the judge. The most famous example was the fabled “immune system cross”. A large amount of evidence was submitted that showed how the key feature of the vertebrate adaptive immune system, rearranging immune receptors (antibodies), evolved. Read the rest at    http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/09/luskin-and-the-2.html    and educate yourself on the current status of science regarding the immune system and its evolution, and compare it with how ID 'explains' said immune system ('poof'). "
2,"I read the entire article.. and of course not being a member of the various fields of genetic research - it was not simple reading, nor did I understand even half of the references they made to various receptors and such.  That considered... it appears to not actually prove the point and also does not answer Behe's original question.also the comments show mixed reactions - and many of the readers reacted as I did... the original question was disregarded. First and foremost - how does an animal without an immune system survive to acquire one.  You would need to live to do so.... a dead animal does not good genetics make.This is what Behe asked... instead what we have is a list of genetic comparisons of immune systems.. showing some as simple and some as complex... well, duh.   This is the same technique as lining up skeletons and saying 'see.... a progression!'.... or not a progression - depending on whether you want to commit to a   crime   of assumption.and besides... the article is about an ID trial... and Behe was presented with this pile of information... how could the judge (who is a judge by trade.. not a geneticist) decide whether or not these technical papers had proven anything?in the articles words ''Judge Jones ruled that “Dr. Miller presented peer-reviewed studies refuting Professor Behe’s claim that the immune system was irreducibly complex.''how would the judge know that... ?  He could have handed the judge a pile of recipes for sponge cake and called it a refutation."
1,"""First and foremost - how does an animal without an immune system survive to acquire one.

As such when an animal 'evolved' the immune system of it's ancestor evolve with it.

2,..... I'm talking about the EVOLUTION of the first immune system.  You can't inherit what doesn't exist..
1,“... I'm talking about the EVOLUTION of the first immune system. You can't inherit what doesn't exist..”True.However for multi cellular life to survive and reproduce it would have to have a way to keep other life from interfering in it’s processes.   As such the only multi-cellular life that would endure would be those that had mutations protecting them from other life forms.  That would be the beginning of the immune system.
2,I think this comes down to an irreducible complexity argument...  how many mutations would be necessary to build this simple defense mechanism.. they would all need to happen simultaneously (or as a stretch.. nearly simultaneously) to be effective.. and thus superior by natural selection.  
1,"“I think this comes down to an irreducible complexity argument...”So far Irreducible Complexity has failed ever time it was tested.  It’s validity as a Scientific theory has never been demonstrated.“how many mutations would be necessary to build this simple defense mechanism.. they would all need to happen simultaneously (or as a stretch.. nearly simultaneously) to be effective.. and thus superior by natural selection.”To reach modern levels quite a few mutations, however they built slowly over the past few million years.  The immune system did not have to arise simultaneously after all…   evolution   is a game of oneupmanship.One species develops defenses against a form of attach and goes on to prosper, while another species develops a new mechanism of attack that bypasses those defenses.  All this happens in a constantly changing   environment   where multiple pressures exist.Also, once a defense against one kind of attack has bee developed it is much easier to develop new defenses against a similar form of attack (once a species has developed a defense against one type of virus it is easier to develop defenses to similar types of viruses)."
1,"The Bible is simply wrong if a literal interpretation is taken: On this question, the Bible just is wrong, and if you insist on holding a literalistic approach to Scripture then the implications you claim do indeed follow. However, there is no theological need to do this. The Roman Catholic and the Anglican churches, for example, have accepted the truth of evolution and they still hold what is a recognisably and distinctively Christian faith. If the authors of the Bible meant their creation stories to be taken literally then their claims are open to scientific test. It is widely held that they wrote stories designed to account for the world as they knew it, and by todays standards these could not be held up as scientific accounts.

1,"ID has no merit except as a religious idea.  For ID to be even minimally logical, the IDer must be God.  Positing any other possible Designer is illogical because the question can be fairly asked: where did they come from?  If they are naturally occuring, then we can be too.  If they are not, then ID just posits God at some degree of separation.ID is, in fact, just a version of creationism.  Actually, ID is one of the oldest forms of scientific creationism; a version of it was proposed by William Paley around 1802; about seven (7) years BEFORE CHARLES DARWIN WAS BORN.  The modern version of ID is differnt from Paley's watchmaker, but only because 206 years have passed.  At least Paley was honest enough to not obscure the religious nature of his idea."
1,"What I desire to beleive is totally irrelevant. If desire guided my beliefs, I would be not only a supporter of Intelligent Design, but a young Earth Creationist and a fundamentalist Christian.

I think is it absolutly shameful for anyone to imply that my position is fanatical because I WANT to be the supreme intelligence in my universe.

I believed in nothing for 25 years.. and now I believe wholeheartedly in God.You should never judge a   religion   by it's followers for one -- people are sinful, perverse, bigoted beings and are not the ruler to go by.  No matter what denomination.  Though I do think I find much more animosity spouted by the atheist... and for balance I do usually find more ignorance from christians...not all - just on the average.

1,"Just as advances in genetic and protein research and mathematics are enabling us to understand and explain how evolution works, a growing number of our society are rejecting science in favor of myth and fake science.Is it that people are losing touch with science because of its complexity; our education system is letting us down; the quality of our news sources is deteriorating; or informative (and could have been enlightening) books like “A New Kind of Science” are so poorly written?"
2,"I really have to give the anti-IDer's credit, you have a lot of faith.  More than I do actually.  Some say that God does not exist and that there is no way in this universe that he created everything, yet what doesn't make sense to me is that there is less of a chance that The Big Bang happened then God actually creating the universe.  Do the math: The Big Bang is really impossible.  I heard a statistic that said the possibility of The Big Bang happening is like a tornado going through a junkyard and assembling A WORKING BOEING 747.Look around you.  Look away from your computer screen for a moment and glance out your window.  Really ask yourself, ""Did all this happen by chance?""  The trees, water, mountains, birds, cats, dogs; I'm not sure how people can believe that this was all a freak accident.  Was it really a concidence that the planet we call Earth just happened to be the IDEAL place for life?  Any closer to the sun, we'd fry.  Any farther, we'd freeze.  We're perfectly placed in the universe and thrive because of it.  Coincidence?  I think not.Most of all, look at yourself.  Ask any doctor and they will tell you that the human body is a remarkable machine.  Well lubricated, efficient, intelligent; what are the chances of the body that you are in now coming from a pile of goo struck by lightning (or however you believe we came to existance).  For those of you who believe that we were not created and came into existance randomly, I give you props for believing in something that mathmatically probably never happened.Also, if there is no God, then we have no purpose; we are useless beings that try to make the most of of what we have been dealt.  Is that what you want to believe?  If you do, then you have more faith than most people.I've found purpose.  I've found happiness.  Have you?"
2,"While in science you cannot prove or falsify the existence of God (and ID doesn't change that), I agree that when it comes to blind faith Dawkins and PZ Myers are guilty of the same thing. I considered atheism for a while after having a growing distaste for what seemed to be an elitist mentality among Christians, but then I realized that this new atheist movement is basically guilty of the same thing.  My mind was made up when I a couple people on youtube posted videos saying atheism offered nothing, and after viewing some of the attempts to prove atheism DID have something to offer, I realized that even if religion WAS false, it at least serves as a catalyst for a happier life. "
2,"The idea that creationists reject mutation or natural selection is ridiculous. These are observable facts. What creationists defend is the idea that these changes cannot create new species, and as a result, a design, a designer, and a creator is necessary. Furthermore, if schools do not teach competing theories, it is comparable to teaching there is no alien life. This cannot be proven or demonstrated, however, it would seem that if that fit in with their theory for the rest of biology, the evolutionists would teach it without question. 
"
1,"Theism is a belief in god/s. Atheism is a *lack* of belief in god/s. Atheists do not claim to have proof that there is no God, but rather are confident to work on the assumption that none exists. The person who makes an outlandish claim has to provide the proof; it doesn't work the other way around. Saying, ""I'm waiting for evidence that God exists, and if that happens I'll reconsider my position, but until then I won't believe"" -- that's atheism, and there's no faith involved there."

1,"Atheism is merely the lack of theistic belief, and it offers nothing beyond that. It exists as a social movement only because arrogant and self-righteous theism is so rampant in this country. If most everyone accepted the lack of religion as readily as they accepted red hair or tattoos, atheism as a movement would cease to exist.If you're looking for a catalyst for a happier life, you'd need to look elsewhere. There are atheistic philosophies that can fill such a gap. Secular humanism is my favorite, but there are atheistic spiritual traditions, including subsets of Taoism and Confucianism."
1,"First of all, science does not make a claim that every feature of the universe can be explained without God. Instead, it makes a host of positive claims that a particular feature of the universe can be explained by some particular mechanism.So, belief in the efficacy and scope of evolution does not equate to a belief in a universe with no metaphysical purpose, or a universe with no creator. Furthermore, you conflate cosmology with biology. The theory of evolution has nothing to say about the origin of the universe. The theory of evolution only explains why living beings posses complex structures which aid in the propagation of life.Finally: ""Did all this happen by chance?"" Scientists do not believe that life is the result of ""chance."" Instead, we believe that life the result of the uniform operation of natural laws. During pregnancy a new organism is formed entirely by the operation of natural laws. This is not the result of chance, and does not make life purposeless."
2,"You're right, science is not atheism, but not that's what most people make it out to be.  They take God totally out of the equation and most deny that He even exists.  Some are even more open to the fact that aliens created us, which takes a lot of faith to believe.I am not just addressing cosmology or biology, I'm addressing the whole concept that God was not involved in creating the universe.  Whether your talking about either one of those particular topics is irrelevant, the real issue is that some people (maybe not yourself) make God absent in creating the universe, you, me, my dog, that that tree outside, and so on.  I do appreciate that you state that ""science is not atheism"" and there are reason's the universe functions as it does (cosmology or biology), but what other explanation is there to...life...or the universe?  Do you have a hypothesis on how we came to be?  I would love to hear it.I think you missed my point about the whole issue of ""chance"".  When I said that, I meant that some believe the universe (cosmology) spontaniously came together by a giant expolsion, and later, just happened to create life as we know it (biology).  ""Chance"" was just a point to illustrate the randomness of our whole universe and ourselves coming together.  I still fail to grasp the amount of faith it takes to believe this.Yes, a baby being formed is natural, but the fact that we as humans are able to reproduce is a miracle all in itself; just look at all the things that it takes to make it all happen.  I just can't understand how some people can think this all came together by ""chance"".  The belief in something other than intelligent design takes much more faith than what I believe.You also missed the point about purpose.  As a Christian, I know that the God who created me has a one-of-a-kind plan for my life.  If God didn't create us (which is highly, highly unlikely) and there is no plan for each of us, then what's the point of living?  If I'm here just to live and die, no wonder the suicide rate is as high as it is!I'll say it again: I've found purpose.  I've found happiness.  HAVE YOU?"
1,"Your argument is compelling until we expand the question of ""How did we get here?"" to encompass the divine. I understand the Christian god had no beginning. I'm not asking, ""Who created god?"" but rather, ""Why should there be a god at all?"" What are the mathematical odds that your god would be the way he is? In light of that question, suddenly the big bang doesn't seem like such an outlandish problem in comparison.We know the big bang happened, for whatever reason. The existence of a divine creator (conveniently) makes no difference in the observable predictions of the big bang, so why does it require faith to eliminate the assumption of a god?I've found purpose and happiness too. Meaning doesn't need to be handed down from above; it comes from within too. That isn't faith; it's the courage to face reality."
2,"With belief.. facing reality doesn't require 'courage'... but facing a world with no purpose behind it.. with no reason except cause and effect, electrons and neutrons, yes - that world requires courage for sure.  Keep in mind that I did not find God out of some need to have an explanation..though I admit even as an atheist the concept sounded 'nice'. Nor was it a need to have this innate courage that comes from a world with reason, it was instead just a bonus.  It's a typical atheistic viewpoint that because the believer lacked the courage to live in a world without some form of security blanket.. that they invent God..on the contrary I came to the conclusion from looking at the evidence and from personal experiences.  The realization was unavoidable.  I was a happy person as an atheist.. -- though I can't describe the happiness that comes from knowing this isn't just a cosmic accident.As far as you question of 'what are the odds your God would be the way he is?'... I truly don't get the question... I'd say 1:1... but that would mean I knew what that meant in the first place?  It's awfully esoteric...  Do you mean what are the odds.. that if there were a God that he would want to have a creation? I'd figure 1:1... though it's rather hard for an imperfect being to imagine the wants of God - but it would seem any God by necessity would 'do' something.... not simply be content as an all encompassing complete and perfect whole... it would most likely 'create' in some form.. and what are the chances that this creation would likely be a reflection of himself in some form.. I'd say 1:1... when you create your creation reflects your character... does it not?  Now the next step becomes more conjectural... if you were to create this 'creation' would it be proper to force upon it absolute obedience?  I'd say that wouldn't be right.. I'd say you'd have to give it a right to dissent... matter of fact I'd give it a 1:1 chance that the only path would be free will.. and thus an imperfect creation - since you cannot have the option to do wrong without it.. so free will is another 1:1 chance.. Now we have a creation.. and it's flawed and yet shows similarities to it's creator.. we need to give this creation some purpose.. some form of reason to exist of sorts.. well I figure the obvious choice would be that the very purpose the creator would devise is a great mystery of 'where did I come from?'  .. in other words.. a beautiful mystery would be 'am I an accident.. or did I come from a creator?'... now THAT would be an ingenious idea... it would be like a game of hide and seek with my creation... It would be the ultimate question and the ultimate purpose... yes, I would give a 1:1 chance that this would be the perfect concept for my creation's 'fulfilling purpose'..  Now another problem... considering I am a perfect creator.. but have made an imperfect being... doomed to mistakes - and suffering.. and now he has a reason for life.. the search for the truth of me.. the creator.. I need to instill a reason for this search...a reward of sorts - since simply knowing I exist is not going to really provide meaning or even reason to search... I have it! the ultimate reward.. to return to me.. their perfect creator - ahhh... but there's a problem.. any reward means a punishment.. and that doesn't sound very benevolent of a perfect creator....hmm.. well then I will come to earth and live as them - in earthly form - yes! perfect idea... and even allow myself to die at their hands to show that I have suffered as they have! .. and I will make the rule that due to my own sacrifice... all that is necessary to return to me - the perfect creator is simply a heartfelt belief.. and an apology!! ingenious .. and perfectly simple!... in conclusion... I'd say if there were a God... which there is... there's a 1:1 chance he would be precisely as we perceive him."

2,"Open-mindedness toward creationism is important. People should not reject discussion of Creationist theory simply because their belief in science and evolution contradict evolution. That would be closed-minded toward the subject. One must be open to the concept or idea (not just debunk it because the theory states a power called GOD and that's not yet proven by science). Many have had a meta-physical experience in their lives that cannot be explained by the existing science. People take to deep faith in these experiences, and would not accept someone else telling them that their experience was false or an illusion. The same can be considered in the notion of creationism, and that off-hand rejection of it is overly closed-minded to the possibility of valid metaphysical realities unexplained by science and evolution.

1,"`Guided by a larger force`. I can't be sure of course, but I believe that that is not the case. If that is true then it seems that it will turn out to be a religious matter, because humans will automatically consider that force as god. Even if some force created us, humans shouldn't take for granted that it did it so that we worship it. He might did it for fun or more likely just because that`s what is does. Why do ants make colonies on the ground and gather in big teams? Because that`s what they do, to survive. Maybe the force needs to create things to survive and if that is the case by now it will probably have forgotten about this place a long long time ago since it will be far far away creating other things."

1,"In order to better understand Intelligent Design, it is important to appreciate how it abuses and conflates terminologies. For instance, ID claims that science is unable to explain 'design' and yet it appeals to science being able to explain design as evidence that ID has content.Let's look at the argument in more detail:---“In all irreducibly complex systems in which the cause of the system is known by experience or observation, intelligent design or engineering played a role [in] the origin of the system.” ---Now remember that complexity refers to our absence to understand how to explain something, and that the statement basically states that ""when we do not understand something"" and it is 'irreducible' then it must be designed. However, we do know that natural pathways to irreducibly complex systems exist, of course, since these pathways are natural, the complexity disappears. However, the same applies when we provide a design explanation.In order for the design inference to be reliable, ID has to be able to show that there are no false positives. And yet we know that historically, people have erroneously assigned design and designers to thunder and lightning, disease, natural disasters, solar eclipses and so on, so the claim that design inferences are reliable is flawed. Now, the mere fact that design inferences are not reliable, does not mean that science cannot use design inferences reliably. But for that science assigns a plausible positive hypothesis which can compete with other explanations. For instance in criminology we look at means, motives and opportunities, combined with eye-witnesses, alibis and physical evidence to generate a plausible hypothesis which can establish ""beyond reasonable doubt"" the guilt or innocence. These forms of design as known as regular design as opposed to rarefied design. In an excellent paper Wilkins et al explain the differences (1)--he second way that the inconsistency can be resolved is as we have already indicated, by recognizing a distinction between ordinary design and rarefied design. For those events where our background information includes information about how agents or processes produce events of high probability, we would assign those to the HP category and explain them with reference to regularity. This would preserve a place for a class of rarefied design in the Explanatory Filter, but Dembski's earlier arguments about design indicating agent causation because his Explanatory Filter captures our usual means of recognizing design would only apply to the class of ordinary design, not the desired rarefied design. It is only by the attempt to inconsistently treat agent causation as a privileged hypothesis that Dembski can (erroneously) claim that ordinary design and rarefied design share a node on the Explanatory Filter.--In other words, instances of rarefied design, since they cannot really compete with the ""we don't know"" explanation, cannot be assigned the category of 'design'.Notice how ID manages by bait and switch to claim both that ID provides an alternative explanation to scientific explanations as well as that ID uses the same scientific approaches as science to make its case. Needless to say, it is trivial to point out the inherent contradiction and show that because of this conflation, ID attempts to claim that it uses similar approaches to science to infer design. However, even a cursory scrutiny of their claims quickly reveals that ID relies not on a scientific approach of providing positive explanations and hypothesis, but rather on elimination and since they refuse to present any way to constrain their designer and thus the design, they are unable to compete with our ignorance.Needless to say, science has found that such simple mechanisms as regularity and chance can in fact increase information and complexity and create what is called in ID parlance ""specified complexity"" in the same manner as ID claims that 'designers' can create such complexity.Finally, it is worth pointing out that ID refuses to admit that there exists a theory which outcompetes their preferred 'single designer' thesis, and shows that a hypothesis of ""multiple designers"" explains the data much better. The unwillingness and inability to address even the simple alternative, shows that ID is more concerned about its religious position than about science.Ask yourself: What has ID done in a non trivial manner, that increases our scientific understanding in a positive manner? Nothing, in fact, it has attempted to downplay scientific knowledge, misrepresent scientific findings, to further its case. More on the latter part in a future contribution.(1) Wilkins, John S, and Wesley R Elsberry. 2001. The advantages of theft over toil: the design inference and arguing from ignorance. Biology and Philosophy 16 (November):711-724."
1,"How does science explain information in life versus Intelligent Design proponents? And why do ID proponents misrepresent science when describing for instance neo-Darwinism?--Casey Luskin writes:Proponents of neo-Darwinism contend that the information in life arose via purposeless, blind, and unguided processes. ID proponents contend that the information in life arose via purposeful, intelligently guided processes. Both claims are scientifically testable using scientific methods employed by standard historical sciences.--While I agree with Casey that science provides testable mechanisms to explain information in life, I disagree strongly with Casey's representation of neo-Darwinism where he conflates theological concepts such as purpose and where he equivocates on 'guided' and 'blind'. Anyone familiar with evolutionary theory would quickly come to realize that evolutionary processes are not 'blind' or even 'unguided', in fact, the only aspect of evolutionary theory which comes close to this description is the concept of 'random' as used when describing mutations. And all random really means is 'random with respect to the effect in a particular environment', in other words, mutations do no arise in response to environmental pressures immediately beneficial to said environment. Casey's suggestion that evolutionary processes are blind and unguided, ignore, as is quite common amongst Creationists, that evolutionary processes include ""natural selection"" where the environment both guides and where the outcome of the process is not 'blind' but rather leads to function. In fact, it is trivial to realize that natural selection is very similar to 'intelligent selection' where in the former case, information is transferred from the environment into the genome (as science has clearly shown to be the case), where the latter one involves the guidance of an intelligence responsible for said increase.So, now we have a situation where we know that both natural and intelligent processes can cause information to increase and we are left to establish which of the various explanations are the best. Since ID refuses to contribute any scientific explanation which positively identifies the processes, mechanisms etc, it remains unable to compete not just with evolutionary science but also with our ignorance ""we don't know hypothesis"".ID claims that information is best explained by intelligence and yet it provides no explanations.Weird eh?"
1,"--Taxibound2--I must say that PvM has a way with words. A few of those words were when he claims that Casey Luskin misrepresents neo-Darwinism because, claiming that “Anyone familiar with evolutionary theory would quickly come to realize that evolutionary processes are not 'blind' or even 'unguided', in fact, the only aspect of evolutionary theory which comes close to this description is the concept of 'random' as used when describing mutations.”--But if you read Casey’s posts, it seems like he is familiar with evolutionary theory because he documents where textbooks and leading evolutionary biologists have described evolution in this fashion. For example, Luskin writes:“Even the widely-touted theistic evolutionary biologist Kenneth Miller has claimed in five editions of his highly popular high school biology textbooks that the implication of evolution is that it works “without either plan or purpose” and is “random and undirected.”(22)”--So in other words, Casey's ignorance is justifiable because he can find a textbook which fails to explain the concept correctly? Is that the full extent of your argument? In fact, are you aware that the author of the textbook accepted responsibility for the flawed definition and had it removed?As to Ayala, I fail to see your point since Ayala correctly describes the historical past--“Similarly, in the prestigious scientific journal, Proceedings for the National Academy of Sciences, leading evolutionary biologist Francisco Ayala celebrates that ""Darwin’s greatest accomplishment” was to show that the origin of life’s complexity “can be explained as the result of a natural process--natural selection--without any need to resort to a Creator or other external agent.""(13)--Without the need to resort to a Creator is what good science is all about. We all know how simplistically easy it is to assign our fears and ignorance to 'God's will', imagine our ancestors who saw God's hand in such issues as thunder and lightning or the stability of orbits of planets (Isaac Newton). You may of course use Luskin's arguments but I suggest that there is a risk involved, namely that his own writings expose a further level of unfamiliarity with evolutionary science.I am here to help you understand the 'rest of the story'"
2,"Attempts to conceal the creationism-evolution controversy from students are dogmatic promotions of evolution.

1,"From Mr. Luskin's argument:""Design theorists *hypothesize* that if a natural object was designed, it will contain high levels of CSI. Scientists then perform experimental tests upon natural objects to determine if they contain complex and specified information.... When experimental work uncovers irreducible complexity in biology, they *conclude* that such structures were designed."" (*emphasis* added)So ID first hypothesizes that CSI implies design, and then concludes that the CSI in biology implies design.  But this is nothing but a restatement of the hypothesis!  What ID forgets to do is to confirm their hypothesis, and somehow empirically support the claim that CSI necessarily implies conscious planning.  ID never even tries to do this.  Instead, ID attempts to make an induction from a single data point, arguing that since human beings can build complex machines and humans are conscious, then everything which can build complex machines must be conscious.  But one data point is not sufficient to induce the characteristics of all possible ""intelligent agents"", and so there is no justification for suggesting the cause of biological complexity (whatever it might have been) was a conscious entity.  One could, by the exact same reasoning, argue that everything which can build complex machines must have large, complex, biological brains.  But this would mean ID can't account for the *origin* of biological complexity after all.So ID does not use the scientific method to infer anything at all.  It merely assumes that all CSI must come from conscious minds because we humans can create it too, which is a perfectly unscientific argument."
1,"I have yet to read a single sentence from any ID proponent that provides ""testable predictions about the type of informational properties we expect to find in nature if an intelligent agent were at work in designing a natural object."" Over and over this or similar verbiage is used to defend ID, but ID never produces any predictions. This isn't a theory, this is an untested hypothesis.""Design theorists hypothesize that if a natural object was designed, it will contain high levels of CSI."" Explicitly and accurately defining CSI in such a manner that a specific prediction can be made would be a good first step. For instance, no where do I find in any ID writing anything that I can use to identify CSI. Is CSI DNA? Is CSI morphology? Is CSI hair color or eye color? Is CSI behavior? How would I know CSI when I see it? Since I can't pin down exactly what CSI is, I can't make any predictions about it, or with it.""Scientists employing ID compare observations of how intelligent agents act when they design things to observations of phenomena whose origin is unknown. Human intelligence provides a large empirical dataset for studying the products of the action of intelligent agents.""In the experience of human beings, other human beings are the only creatures we have ever demonstrably seen design anything. (Meaning we can prove that the designed thing was designed)  ID STARTS from a biased position. How often has the design hypothesis, caused by this human bias to detect agents, failed when used to explain natural phenomena? Ask any child in Sunday school what thunder is, and you will hear a failed design hypothesis: ""the angels are bowling.""""Mathematician and philosopher William Dembski observes that ""the principal characteristic of intelligent agency is directed contingency, or what we call choice.""(5) When ""an intelligent agent acts, it chooses from a range of competing possibilities"" to create some complex and specified event. Dembski calls ID ""a theory of information"" where ""information becomes a reliable indicator of design as well as a proper object for scientific investigation."" ID thus seeks to find in nature the types of information which are known to be produced by intelligent agents, and reliably indicate the prior action of intelligence.""What information is 'known to be produced by intelligent agents, and reliably indicate the prior action of intelligence?' Again, define explicitly what CSI is.""Irreducible complexity is a form of specified complexity, which exists in systems composed of ""several interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.""

""ID is a historical science, meaning it employs the principle of uniformitarianism, which holds that the present is the key to the past.

What are the 'positive predictions' made by ID?""Specifically, the theory predicts that we will find large amounts of specified complexity in natural objects.""Oh, there they are. ID predicts that complex things are complex. Does ID offer anything MORE specific?""Intelligent design has scientific merit because it is an empirically based argument that uses well-accepted scientific methods of historical sciences in order to detect in nature the types of complexity which we understand, from present-day observations, are derived from intelligent causes.""And it does so without explicit definitions of terms used in it's arguments, specific predictions, experiments that have validated it's predictions, or any other kind of evidence that is useful or relevant when evaluating it's truth claims.When held to the standards of proof required for all other scientific theories, ID fails."

1,"I am curious about one thing - Luskin states:""ID investigations thus begin with observations about how intelligent agents operate and then proceed to convert those observations into positive predictions of what scientists should find in nature if intelligent design was involved in the origin of a given natural object.""He justifies this assertion with this:""Specifically, the theory predicts that we will find large amounts of specified complexity in natural objects [after an exposition on an analogy employed by theologian/philosopher Meyer)...As Meyer explains, “by invoking design to explain the origin of new biological information, contemporary design theorists are not positing an arbitrary explanatory element unmotivated by a consideration of the evidence. Instead, they are positing an entity possessing precisely the attributes and causal powers that the phenomenon in question requires as a condition of its production and explanation.”(18) ""In other words - Meyer is making an argument via analogy - made with lots of buzzwords and unnecessarily verbose prose.If that is why ID is scientific, and if that is an example of a ""prediction"" that has been ""tested"", then I am afraid that ID is utterly worthless, for it consists of:1. Construct an analogyDNA is sort of like languiage, it is a code - why, we even call it th egenetic code2. Make a syllogism employing the sketchy analogy -Humans are complex.  Humans make language/codes.  DNA is like a language/code. Therefore, DNA was made by a complex being like a human3. Manipulate syllogism so as to appear to be an hypothesis -DNA, being coded information, must have been made by complex intelligent agents, since we know that other complex intelligent agents, us, make codes/languages4. Conclude what was assumed in step 1 and call it a tested and confirmed prediction - ID predicted that DNA would be the product of an intelligent agent because it contains coded informaiton.We know that coded inforaiton comes from intelligent agents.Therefore, DNA was made by an intelligent agent.Therefore, DNA was designed.Brilliant."

1,"Casey Luskin knows how to use impressive multi-syllabic words to suggest that he's intelligent. By gosh, he almost sounds like a scientist when he says that ""The form of information which reliably indicates design is generally called 'specified complexity' or 'complex and specified information,' "" whatever the hell that means. Apparently, all it means is that if a process with many components (therefore ""complex"") behaves so as to head coherently in a single direction (therefore ""specified""), then it must be the result of   intelligent design  . OK, then try this one.Get a hundred people to each throw a handfull of sand, perhaps a thousand grains per handfull (that's ""complex""), at a wall. Watch to see what happens. If all of the 100,000 grains reverse direction when they hit the wall and then curve downward and end up on the floor (that's ""specified""), with absolutely no communication among them, then surely they must have been guided by an intelligent designer.Ah, but Mr. Luskin would object that the analogy is irrelevant, because while there was some random component to the movement of the various grains of sand, in the final analysis they were all subject to the overriding influence of gravity, and that's why they moved in a similar way and ended up on the floor. That's true. And in the same way, the various organisms and their various organs have shown significant randomness throughout their evolution, but in the final analysis, they were all subject to the overriding influence of natural selection and the survival of the fittest. The least fit died; the most fit survived and contributed their genes to the next generation. The grains of sand all ended up on the floor without any conscious intention of going there, just because they were all influenced by gravity. In the same way, all those organisms kept on improving their fitness without any intention on anyone's part, just because those who were most fit survived and reproduced while the least fit died, as any reasonable person would expect. What's so mysterious about that? Would you expect anything different? Do you need to hypothesize a grandfatherly old codger in the sky who manipulated every gene in every organism? Get real."
1,"ALL human design (and resulting construction) starts with what exists: a designer and things (entities).  Human design is impossible without the designer understanding something about the existents he's designing with else he's not designing. At minimum he's juxtoposing entities at a certain time and place, in a certain orientation, which, itself is a form of design requiring human thought, a human able to act, and the ability to separate those entities from others by distinguishing their fixed attributes (order) from those of other existing entities.ID trys to switch the argument from design with existents---a common human activity, to a non-existing designer that designs and constructs something from nothing. The design argument is false because of this bait-and-switch as noted by other commenter.ID makes the common mistake of seeing what order and assuming that means it must have been designed. But, as I've shown, design requires order to prexist in the designer and the entities the designer designs with. Yes, new order is the result of the design, but that's how we distinguish what was designed or not. Not whether it has order, but whether it's possible for a human to have created it---designed and construct it."
2,"Theories are not supported by finding confirming evidence only.  They are largely supported by consistently failing to find disconfirming evidence.  Conversely, they are refuted by consistently finding disconfirming evidence.  Confirming or disconfirming evidence is determined by making predictions. On the condition that the predictions logically follow from the explanation the theory provides, failed predictions are disconfirming evidence and successful predictions are confirming evidence. Although it is clear that ID has led to some successful predictions, the best way to test ID is ultimately to derive predictions that logically follow from the explanation and never (or hardly ever) make failed predictions.Those opposed to ID must use ID and generate failed predictions even when the predictions logically follow from the explanation.  Predictions that do not logically follow from the explanation will not be a test of ID.  For example, stating ""If there is design in nature, then nature will be perfect"" contains a prediction that does not logically follow from the explanation.  This is because we have a wealth of experiences with designed objects, none of which are ""perfect"".  Another example of an illogical prediction is ""If the world is designed, then there should be no pain and suffering"".  This is because we have experiences of designed things that cause great pain and suffering.I would like to see real scientists do real tests of ID. "

2,"“So what, using   intelligent design   , is the purpose of the appendix?”ID simply predicted that the appendix would have a function.

Since the appendix was once used as evidence for evolutionary theory (  http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/vestiges/appendix.html  ), I am skeptical that evolutionary theory also found a function for the appendix.  Any theory that predicts both A and Not A is no theory at all.  So, it seems as though evolutionary theory's ability to predict both function of the appendix and non-function makes it not a theory, but merely a set of observations which themselves need explaining by a genuine scientific theory.

Evolutionary theory needed to be revised because it was wrong, but ID need not be revised because it never made that false prediction.  ID predicts that   change   occurs at different rates.  However, a theory can be revised so much that it really isn't a theory anymore but simply a set of observations.  Natural selection can explain slow change, but how can it explain the Cambrian Explosion?  It is not enough for evolutionary theory to simply admit that this explosion occurred, but evolutionists must explain how random mutation and natural selection can produce this event.  In other words, a theory that revises it's prediction must also revise it's explanation, but the explanation offered by evolutionary theory has not been revised.  What makes me skeptical that evolutionary theory can be falsified is that evolutionists will simply revise the observational aspects of the theory whenever it is contradicted by evidence and then claim that evolutionary theory can explain that evidence when, in fact, in cannot.

Essentially then, the e. coli had 1.2 million years to change into a new species via natural selection and random mutation.  Evolutionary theory claims that the past 1.2 million years of our history has included not just one but at least three examples of speciation via random mutation and natural selection.  The e. coli did not undergo any speciation even though it is a much simpler organism.  Lenski's study failed to find support for evolutionary theory.

This contradiction was ignored by the reviewers and editor of the journal.  “Can you show one recorded demonstration of intelligent design in action? One scientific study that would show the manipulation of a designer?”I could remind you of many examples of homo sapiens intelligently altering organisms, but I cannot show you a non-homo sapien live and in-person designing anything.   Intelligent Design is inferred from the evidence, much like the intelligent design of pyramids is inferred from the evidence even though no one can actually show me Egyptians building them thousands of years ago.  Unobserved entities are allowed in science, such as dark matter/  energy  ."

When the design happens does a herd of the new species miraculously materialize into existence? Are they born to mothers of a completely different species?I'll consider that ID is more than smoke and mirrors if someone can give me good answers to how these designed species come into existence."
1,"""In fact, the history of life shows a pattern of explosions where new fossil forms come into existence without any clear evolutionary precursors, concurring with design theory that predicts that species might appear abruptly.""This is a good example of how ID creationists describe the scientific data of the Cambrian explosion. They even extensively quote mine expert Valentine who recently has argued that based on the evidence, he believes that Darwinian processes are quite sufficient to explain this so called 'explosion' which was neither an explosion nor without evolutionary precursors.Weird stuff, but anyone familiar with the vast research in this area has to reject these simplistic and even erroneous representations of the Cambrian 'explosion'.So why do we still hear about them?"
1,"-- Jay --Intelligent design (ID) has scientific merit in paleontology because in many instances, it can be applied to the fossil record to detect where design has occurred in the history of life by finding the rapid introduction of large amounts of complex and specified information (CSI).(2) (CSI was described in greater detail in my first opening statement.)---First of all, no such calculations have ever been applied so it is at best a promissory note. Worse, CSI is not even a reliable detector of 'design' as it cannot preclude natural processes. Worse of course is that even if CSI could be calculated, it would have no relevance as it provides us with no explanations, no mechanisms, nothing. At best, a minor mystery for science to unravel.What is fascinating to me is how Jay continues to quote mine Darwin and misrepresent the science when it comes for instance to intermediates. Worse, he continues a fine tradition of quote mining Gould. And then he claims that Gould somehow changed his position. While rhetorically understandable, I find it hard to understand why such arguments are made since they not only are trivially shown to be wrong or misleading. But lacking science of their own, what other choices are there for ID proponents?Now it can be at least partially excused by observing that Jay is not a biologist and thus he may have failed to appreciate Gould's statements which are not contradictory. According to the DI's website, Richard is--Jay Wesley Richards has a Ph.D.(honors) in philosophy and theology from Princeton Theological Seminary, where he was formerly a Teaching Fellow.--I am sure that his theological backgrounds have found a good home with the center of Intelligent Design, the Discovery Institute. One may ask oneself what theology and philosophy have to contribute to the scientific status of ID. On the other hand, given that ID is scientifically without content, the theological angle may be more promising? Of course, even there ID has countered much opposition from Christians.But perhaps Jay can help us understand how ID explains these observations? Was a God involved in all these species transitionals, although he was less involved in transitions between higher groups? How was such achieved? Why are species still following the expected nested hierarchies? Is the creator restricted in how he can create? Surely such questions seem perhaps more appropriate for a theology PhD to address?"
1,"---Since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists -- whether through design or stupidity, I do not know -- as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are abundant between larger groups.- Gould, Stephen Jay 1983. ""Evolution as Fact and Theory"" in Hens Teeth and Horse's Toes: Further Reflections in Natural History. New York: W. W. Norton & Co., p. 258-260.----Part of the extensive resources at Talkorigins,     http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/part3.html    More after I do some more research, it's time to reject these arguments once and for all because they add no credibility to ID and they serve to do a disservice to these scientists."
2,"Preventing the teaching of creationism violates freedom of religion. Many groups contend that evolution directly instructs that Genesis is wrong. If this is true, than allowing only the teaching of evolutionary theory directly undermines a religious doctrine. Young, impressionable students are more likely to believe such teachings. This should not be the case. Public schools should allow for the teaching of all salient doctrines and theories. No favor should be given one way or another. This principle is known as ""Freedom of Religion"" and is protected in the United States by the Establishment Clause. This clause ensures that no favor or dis-favor be given to any religious doctrine, yet this is precisely what is happening if creationism is prevented by the state from being taught in schools.

I would like for Luskin to explain why he thinks that ID should predict an abrupt rather than a non-abrupt appearance of species."
1,"Perhaps the author can explain why, of all of the thousands of researchers in geology, biology (particularly evolutionary biologists), and paleontology.. in other words the people who are truly eperts in this area.... no more than a very tiny minority support ID. Why so much emphasis on the fossil record, and little reference to what DNA tells us?And, if a common ancestor is not incompatible with ID, then why is evolution incompatible with the concept of God? Couldn't God have created the evolutionary process as his way of propagating life? Fundamental religious people often blindly call on faith to explain difficult or even paradoxical concepts (why do children die?). They appeal to God's mysterious ways, and cite mankind's hubris in attempting a rational explanation. But in the case of evolution, they turn around and claim to know that God does not favor this particular format for the creation of life. Presumably this is because the Bible provides evidence to the contrary. But now we hear that the Bible is subject to interpretation, as, instead of a 7 day process, the creation of life was done over eons, with new forms appearing spontaneously. Do you believe in the Bible literally, or do you not? And if not, how can you use it to support ID?"

1,"The DI is correct to point out that a lack of merit of ID should not be confused with its religious implications, however the combinations of its religious foundations with a lack of scientific content, provides a strong argument against ID having merit scientifically and delegates it to the realm of theology. As Schloss points out in his review of the movie ""Expelled"", in response of the following statement by Hugh Ross, who is leads a prominent Christian apologetics organization called ""Reasons to Believe""--Ross:they affirm that the approach of seeking the right to be heard avoids denigrating the scientific enterprise, either its individuals or institutions…we have encountered no significant evidence of censorship, blackballing, or disrespect. [and] have witnessed an increasing openness on the part of unbelieving scientists to offer their honest and respectful critique. Our main concern about Expelled is that it paints a distorted picture. It certainly doesn't match our experience. Sadly, it may do more to alienate than to engage the scientific community, and that can only harm our mission.--Schloss comments that:--While both are important, earning the “right to be heard,” as Ross emphasizes, is surely not the same as demanding the “right to speak,” as Expelled focuses on. Expelled never ends up convincingly demonstrating that the latter is in any real jeopardy, but sadly, it does much to jeopardize the former.--Source: Jeffrey P. Schloss, ""Overcoming or Raising Walls of Division?"" Center for Faith, Ethics, and Life Sciences Westmont CollegeA right to speak does not mean a right to be earned, the latter one needs to be earned and in order for ID to have any merit to be discussed in science classrooms, it first needs to show a compelling reason as to why. So far ID has failed miserably in presenting a scientific argument. From a theological perspective, the concept of ID seems rather dangerous as it pretends to open up religious faith to scientific scrutiny and thus disproof."
1,"--But I think you don’t realize the importance of your concession that “The DI is correct to point out that a lack of merit of ID should not be confused with its religious implications.” Do you realize that your concession actually refutes many of the critics’ arguments that the implications of ID make it unscientific? For example, see The Ayn Rand Institute’s posts argue that if ID implies a supernatural creator (at the bottom of a chain of designers), then ID is unscientific.--I am very aware of my 'concession' namely that it is not just the religious motivations of ID which disqualifies ID as having merit as a science, it's the lack of scientific contributions (the examples you mention have little or no relevance to the concept of ID but are at best examples of ""ID proponents can also do real science"") which dooms ID to a lack of merit as a scientific contribution.That ID points to the supernatural is one of the major reasons why it lacks content as such a 'creator' (oops designer) cannot be constrained and thus explains nothing.I am not sure if the NCSE argues that ID is unscientific just because it is religiously motivated. I think that their argument may be better phrased as ""ID's religious motivation helps explain why it has remained scientifically vacuous"". This is after all not really about science.Sure, ID proponents can do real and even good science, but that hardly has any relevance to the issue of whether or not ID has any scientific merit. I hope you understand this major distinction."
1,"Intelligent design, if true, would indeed have amazing implications.  Again...if it were true.ID is an incomplete hypothesis, not a scientific theory.  It does not show a detailed analysis of the data that supports the assertions it makes.  It does not offer predictions that will validate it's claims.  It has not proposed experiments that can be done to either falsify or support it.ID's entire argument is: As a biased observer, I think life is designed, therefore it is.  I'm not going to explain it, or attempt to prove it, it's obvious.  If you don't agree, you must have an agenda.Newton and Kepler did turn out to be right, and the author is right, it was not because of their religious beliefs.  It was because of their solid science.  ID will not be proven right; not because it has religious foundations, but because it has no solid science."
2," Evolution is unobserved; it is an unproven theory - The term evolution can describe a number of things, some of which are directly observable while others are not.  Evolutionists extrapolate evidence for observed evolution to be evidence for unobserved evolution. We have directly observed that random mutations invoke change and that nature sometimes selects for these mutations. Such mutations, however, are the result of the degregation of already existing information, not the development of new information.  The development of new information via random mutation has not been observed. What has been observed is a very low ceiling for the number of mutations that the economy of life will allow before fitness costs become fatal. This is why bacteria have yet to grow arms, despite our direct observation of billions of generations.

1,"In arguing for the existence of god, Dr. Rihards' states... ""we see physical laws that look like they were set up for the existence of complex life"".This from a man who is committed to Intelligent Design, which is at its core, the the idea that physical laws are not sufficient to account for complex life."
1,"Of course, ID has to move from its position of ignorance, to a position which allows it to be fully reconcilable with science, namely by arguing a position of 'front loading' which moves the design event to coincide with the Big Bang.Neat to see how ID proponents have come to move towards a more scientific position, although it does render the ID position to a status of fully religious."
1,"I don't agree with the very first statement that ""ID limits its claims to what can be scientifically inferred from the empirical domain."" A force unaffected by time and physics that cannot be detected or measured and does not reliably or predictably act cannot be scientifically inferred. But, since ID supposes a supernatural source, isn't it obligated to investigate the supernatural and find said source? ID works from the presupposition that there is an intelligence out there that created our world and situation. So one would think it makes a big difference to humanity if Earth was formed from a goddess ripped apart by a pair of Aztec gods, or if we all happen to be living in the Dreamtime. "
1,"Sharky has pointed out the problem with ID, namely the flawed concept that ordinary and rarefied design can be detected reliably based on the same approach. In fact, we know that in case of ordinary design, science relies on positive hypotheses based on means, motives, opportunities, physical and circumstantial evidence, eye witnesses and more. Rarefied design, by its nature, cannot be constrained and thus science lacks methodology to reliably detect it using the 'design inference' method proposed by ID.Simple really, if the design inference would lead to false positives (inferring design where there wasn't) it is useless per Dembski's own statements. Since we know of quite a few examples where design inferences led to false positives, the conclusion seems self evident.When will ID admit to this?"
1,"""A.    Intelligent design does not study the designer, but rather studies natural objects to determine if they bear the tell-tale signs that they were designed by an intelligent cause.""And that study has completely failed to convince real scientists that there really are any biological entities that bear such supposedly tell-tale signs.  So intelligent design fails in its anti-evolution purpose.""B.    Intelligent design does not attempt to address religious questions about the identity or metaphysical nature of the designer.""Wise choice.  But what about non-religious questions like how, what, and when?  Oops.  Intelligent design does not try to address those questions either.""C.    Intelligent design’s non-identification of the designer stems from an intent to respect for limits of scientific inquiry and not make claims that go beyond what can be learned using scientific methods.""Hilarious.  You aren't actually using the scientific method and you are not making any claims that make any sense, so talking about a supposed designer doesn't make any sense anyway.""Explanations that call on intelligent causes require no miracles but cannot be reduced to materialistic explanations.""Riiight.  So it's not natural, but it's also not supernatural.  Silly me, I thought those two categories were rather all-encompassing.""What has kept design outside the scientific mainstream these last 130 years is the absence of precise methods for distinguishing intelligently caused objects from unintelligently caused ones.""Seems reasonable to me.  And since that is still true today, ...""Intelligent causes can be inferred through confirmable data.""So you say.  How come those silly scientists don't believe you?  Do they just look at your ""confirmable data"" and say ""nonsense""?  No intelligent cause required?  Isn't it just ""obvious""?  What kind of proof are they demanding?  Oh, that's right, you refuse to speculate about the nature of this ""intelligent cause"".  So why don't they simply think your explanation is a miracle?  What's the difference between an unexplainable ""intelligent cause"" and a ""miracle""?"
1,"The DI agrees that “Methodological naturalism simply requires that, in trying to explain any particular observation or experimental result, an investigator may not resort to miracles. (14)""  Note the word ""requires"".  This is the fundamental definition of science.The DI claims:""ID is not an appeal to a supernatural cause""but that is not the right question.  The right question is - does ID ALLOW a supernatural cause?  If it does, then it can never be science.""Critics will immediately reply that while ID may not specifically invoke supernatural causation, it leaves open the possibility there was a supernatural creator.  For this reason, they will argue that by permitting supernatural causation, ID may be subject to the “whim of a deity” and loses the predictability and reliability required by methodological naturalism.""Of course.  And that means it can never be science.  So in the next sentence, the DI waves its hands and asserts that:""This argument is logically flawed.""Hilarious.  Why are they allowed to claim this argument is logically flawed?  The supernatural can never be part of science and ID admits that their ""intelligent cause"" could be supernatural.  Therefore it follows that ID can never be part of science.  If their ""intelligent designer"" swoops into this natural world on a ""whim"" and does something, science could never understand or explain it.  Science would always say ""I don't know why this happened.""  If ID admits that searching for a natural cause to explain some natural effect could be fruitless, then ID should give up that search and remain outside of science.  If ID thinks that there really could be a natural cause that explains their supposed design effect, they should tell their religious supporters and stop taking money from them.So in the next paragraph, let's change the subject:""While it is true that ID permits supernatural causation, the same is true of neo-Darwinism.""Again hilarious.  Fundamentally, science assumes that there will never be a supernatural cause that produces a natural effect.  If this happened, science would be ""baffled"".  Science would say ""I don't know yet.""  Science would continue to look for a natural cause forever.  Science never gives up.  Maybe that Nobel Prize for a new natural law discovery will be found next year.The DI has spent millions of dollars on their campaign of propaganda.  They may claim that they are spending dollars on ""research"".  But is it research to find a natural cause for their supposed natural ""design effect""?  Of course not.  They are forever in a state of ""I don't know"" so that really means ""Let's don't go there.""  So they can never do real scientific research into the question of WHY and HOW this cause produces this effect.  They can never come up with a scientific explanation.  (And that would assume that there is something which actually needs explaining.)And their propaganda continues:""More importantly, the design can be strongly inferred regardless of whether the designer is natural or supernatural.""Baloney.  No evolutionary scientist agrees with that assertion.And then their final statement:""The theory of ID is simply an effort to empirically detect whether the “apparent design” in nature acknowledged by virtually all biologists is genuine design (the product of an intelligent cause)""A ""theory"" must do more than ""detect"".  A theory must EXPLAIN WHY.  So it is very clear from this admission that there can never be a ""theory of ID"".  A supernatural cause is outside of science and can never be used to explain why something happens in the natural world.So, does ""intelligent design"" have scientific merit?  Of course not."
2,"When I grew up, science was a useful tool for discovering things about the world around us.  What is this revised definition?  If science excludes possibilities before considering them, it has ceased to be a useful tool for learning about reality.The problem is that the origin of life is not science; it was an historical event.  Both evolutionary scientists and IDers make a major mistake by sometimes claiming to address a historical topic (the origin of life) while ignoring historical evidence.  No human observed the origin of life.  The Bible claims to be the Word of God, who did observe life's origin (as He created it).  To make up excuses to refuse to consider this possibility is shows a glaring lack of critical thinking.So while ID is useful in understanding reality because it is willing to consider the possibility of a designer, it still avoids considering important historical evidence recorded in the Bible."
2, And this site says it better than I could. I love this site. I often go to read its comments and periodicals and newsletters. Here is an article on ID that does discuss the supernatural and I felt it did so very well.  http://www.godandscience.org/evolution/intelligentdesign.html  There are other nice articles too and I like the resources he uses and states at end of articles.

Clearly, it is because his concept of the “designer” is a supernatural one—which was exactly what I was arguing.""If discussion and consideration on the source or identity of the designing force are NOT a part of ID then how would that argument hold?"
2,"The history of God's creation should be taught irrespective of it being considered ""science"". Why does creationism have to be considered ""scientific"" to be taught?

2,"The Ayn Rand Center says:- ID claims that design can be inferred merely from observed complexity (“specified complexity”)—i.e., that complexity is prima facie evidence for design.- But on this premise, any natural being capable of designing the complex features of earthly life would exhibit sufficient complexity to require its own designer.---------------------------------yes.. a scientist who creates life requires a designer. still -- this is really your argument?

A 'supernatural' agent CAN be documented... evidence of a ghost for example...to say we shouldn't look for 'supernatural' agents is to say we shouldn't look for anything we haven't seen already.  It's like the idea of 'don't talk to strangers'... well if you don't talk to strangers.. how would you ever meet anyone?..

1,"“This whole argument is just using flaws in our definitions..   science   looks for 'supernatural' things all the time.. and sometimes we find them.. and they become natural.”Science does not look for things outside of nature (Super natural) it makes an observation of a phenomena and (under the assumption that there is a natural explanation for the phenomena) attempts to produce a theory that can be used to explain the phenomena, and to predict when the phenomena occurs.“The dragonfly gave us ideas on how to build a helicopter.... but our helicopters suck in comparison.”How so?  Our helicopters are far more useful then the dragonfly.  We can ride in it and have them lift massive objects.  Also the principals behind dragonfly flight (and all insect flight) is drastically different from how helicopters fly.“Nature is impressive.. man, not as much.

1,"Needless to say, even ID proponents have come to realize that ID is lacking scientifically speakingFor instance Young Earth Creationist, philosopher and ID proponent Paul Nelson is on the record as saying-- Easily the biggest challenge facing the ID community is to develop a full-fledged theory of biological design. We don’t have such a theory right now, and that’s a problem. Without a theory, it’s very hard to know where to direct your research focus. Right now, we’ve got a bag of powerful intuitions, and a handful of notions such as ‘irreducible complexity’ and ‘specified complexity’-but, as yet, no general theory of biological design.--Paul Nelson, Touchstone Magazine 7/8 (2004): pp 64 – 65.More recently, godfather of ID, lawyer Phil Johnson has stated--I also don’t think that there is really a theory of intelligent design at the present time to propose as a comparable alternative to the Darwinian theory, which is, whatever errors it might contain, a fully worked out scheme. There is no intelligent design theory that’s comparable. Working out a positive theory is the job of the scientific people that we have affiliated with the movement. Some of them are quite convinced that it’s doable, but that’s for them to prove…No product is ready for competition in the educational world.--Michelangelo D’Agostino ""In the matter of Berkeley v. Berkeley"", Berkeley Science Review, issue 10, spring 2006Now remember that Johnson has described quite accurately the goal of ID-- “Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools.”--Source: American Family Radio, Jan 10, 2003 broadcast, in which Johnson “discusses his book The Right Questions, encouraging Christians to actively debate issues of eternal value.”Various other ID proponents have similarly come to this conclusion, not only arguing that the issue of ID is not really about science, since ID lacks much of any scientific foundation allowing it to be a scientific hypothesis, but also that it is all about religion.It's not the religious motivations which doom ID to irrelevance, it's the lack of scientific merit and content which makes ID at best a flawed religious argument, an argument which many Christians, including me, have come to reject.The ASA (American Scientific Affiliation) is an organization where scientists of Christian faith can share their faith and science and they have come to reject Intelligent Design because it is scientifically vacuous and theologically flawed."
1,"This post by Casey Luskin graphically illustrates why Intelligent Design is not science. Lack of even simple standards of scholarship fatally flaw ID arguments. For example, in attempting to discuss a paper by Pancer et al., (Nature, 2004 Vol. 430: 174-180) that Luskin thinks shows that there was a big gap in the origin of the vertebrate immune system, Lusking claims:  Furthermore, when these authors say that the usage of IG domains is “untraceable,” they are not asking the question “from what were these materials co-opted during evolution?” IG domains are found throughout biology from bacteria to humans and thus it is simple to imagine where higher vertebrates might have co-opted such domains. Rather, this paper is talking about the type of deeper question Behe raises: by what Darwinian pathway did IG domains evolve into the type of IG domain used by antibodies in the adaptive immune system of higher vertebrates?  This completely misrepresents the Pancer paper. It was not in anyway about the evolution of Ig domains, and as such it did not ask questions about Darwinian pathways to Ig, contray to what Luskin implies. The Pancer et al., paper reports the discovery of  the class of molecules that produced allograft rejection in Lampreys. They found it was not an Ig system, as in jawed fish and the rest of us vertebrates, but due to a completely different class of molecule. In Jawless fish, there is no adaptive Ig system. The one throwaway line line that Luskin quotes needs to be seen in the context that the paper was written (discovering the mechanism of adaptive immunity in an organism without rearranging Ig molecules), it is not saying that we have no idea of how Ig molecules evolved. In fact, it says nothing about the evolution of Ig molecules at all.For a paper that actually does look at the evolution of Ig molecules, one need look no further than another paper Pancer et all published in 2004. Note that before this paper was published, it was already known that several Ig-like molecules had been identified in amphioxus and sea squirts that could play the role of the ancestor of Ig. This is not just proteins with the Ig fold, but deeper Ig structure.  In sea squirts there are Ig fold proteins (nectin and Junctional Adehesion Molecules) with an Ig fold and a Constant-Variable domain architecture just like the immunoglobulins. Also in amphioxus there is an Ig protein which is used in innate immunity (the Variable Domain Chitin Binding proteins) that was known in 2004 (in 2006 a protein that is a very similar to the T Cell Receptor and is involved in innate immunity was found in the amphioxus, be here I'm dealing with 2004  knowledge relevant to Behe's testimony).Pancer's paper on the evolution of Ig molecules  Pancer Z, Mayer WE, Klein J, Cooper MD (2004) Prototypic T cell receptor and CD4-like coreceptor are expressed by lymphocytes in the agnathan sea lamprey. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:13273-13278 . Here they report finding a molecule in the lymphocytes of Lampreys that looks very much like the immunogloblulin T Cell Receptor. Not only does it have an Ig fold, and a constant-variable domain structure, it also has a joining, constant and cytoplasmic chain structure  that matches the structure of  modern rearranging T Cell Receptors. It looks just like you would expect a non-rearranging ancestor of  TCR/Ig to look like. SInce then several other memebrs of non-rearranging Ig like molecules have been found in Lamprey lymphocytes. Now, it wouldn't take much to discover this paper on Ig evolution, a simple PubMed search would have found this paper, it is also listed in reviews on the evolution of adaptive immunity from 2004 to 2005. Yet Luskin ignores it completely and discusses, as his key argument against our account of the evolutuon of immunity, a paper which does not look at the evolution of Ig at all.Let me repeat this, Luskin is using a paper that reports that a) Lampreys have an adaptive immune system and b) the Lamprey genome does not adaptive immunoglobulin genes, and then discoverers the mechanisms that produce adaptive immunity (a novel variant of an innate immunity mechanism) to claim that we have no accounts of how Ig molecules could have evolved. He ignores the paper by the same group that reports the very protein that Luskin claims is missing from our account of immune system evolution. If a prominent ID advocate can't even get the description of one basic paper right, how are they going to handle more complicated papers on the evolution of the immune system? "
1,"--Ian asksIf a prominent ID advocate can't even get the description of one basic paper right, how are they going to handle more complicated papers on the evolution of the immune system?--In other words, it's not just the ignorance of science but the ignorance of the ID proponent which seems to trigger 'design inferences'.  The subjective nature of the design inference seems to be another problematic component. And remember, according to Dembski if the filter triggers a false positive (detects design where there is none) it would render the filter useless. Dembski goes on to claim that no false positives are ever triggered by the filter but we already know that this is wrong."
1,"""ID has legal and educational merit because it is a bona fide scientific theory ...""The problem is that the word ""theory"" has a scientific definition and ""  intelligent design  "" has never provided any definition that would qualify it as a ""scientific theory"".""Legally assessing whether ID science or religion is complicated by the fact that courts have not agreed upon a consensus definition of science or religion.""Fortunately, the courts have let scientists decide what is science and theologists decide what is religion.  Since ""intelligent design"" is not actually science, whether or not it is religion is irrelevant.  But the words ""intelligent design"" are clearly used by creationists in their attempts to claim that evolution is wrong.  So if those words actually had any meaning, everyone would assume it was a religious meaning."
1,"None of these promises have much relevance to ID as a concept nor have few if any come to fruition. The proof is in the pudding, the saying goes and ID so far has remained scientifically without content and while it surely makes a lot of promises, it has made little or no progress to actually live up to said promises.As to the 'hostility' towards intelligent design, scientists have come to realize that ID's foundations and its lack of scientific content make it an enemy of reason, as an unconstitutional attempt to introduce a yet to be proven scientific concept into our public schools. As guardians of science, scientists and their organizations have a duty to speak out as to the nature of ID.ID has the right to speak, but that does not mean a right to be heard."
1,The only reason there would be more research into junk DNA would be because ID supporters have misunderstood what ID has to say about junk DNA - which is precisely nothing.Might I suggest that the main reason why the authors think that ID would open up new avenues of scientific research in animal biology is because they don't know the meaning of the word 'vestigial'?
2,"Schools should teach competing theories The idea that creationists reject mutation or natural selection is ridiculous. These are observable facts. What creationists defend is the idea that these changes cannot create new species, and as a result, a design, a designer, and a creator is necessary. Furthermore, if schools do not teach competing theories, it is comparable to teaching there is no alien life. This cannot be proven or demonstrated, however, it would seem that if that fit in with their theory for the rest of biology, the evolutionists would teach it without question.

1,"Unfortunately Dr. Behe continues his standard modus operandi, which is making bald assertions backed up by incredibly tenditious interpretations of mainstream evolutionary research, and ignoring the counterevidence which has been publicly presented to him again and again.In this essay Behe makes basically two assertions: (1) observed evolution mostly produces ""degradative changes"" and (2) mutation & selection cannot produce irreducibly complex systems.  Addressing them in turn:1. Behe, either here or elsewhere, has provided no objective definition of what evolutionary changes are ""degradative"" and what are ""improvements"".  It's entirely his subjective opinion, which lets him arbitrarily declare anything he feels forced to accept as a natural evolutionary product to be ""degradative"".  But what is degradative?  Probably most evolutionary changes that improve e.g. a protein in one aspect ""degrade"" a protein in some other aspects.  Optimization for specific binding to substrate A will often (not always) decrease binding to substrate B.  But on this standard, a great number of evolutionary changes that Behe surely would consider ""improvements"" would actually be ""degradative.""  Ape feet are prehensile, with thumbs and great dexterity.  They evolved into human feet, which have pretty miserable dexterity and actually aren't even that good as feet compared to, say, virtually any other large running vertebrate (think of cow hooves or ostrich feet).  Bird wings are pretty spiffy at flight, but they're no good at what they used to be (the grasping forelimbs of bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs).  Human brains are certainly great evolutionary innovations, but came at the cost of numerous, pretty much ludicrous compromises from the point of view of a tidy-minded designer focused on a general sense of improvement (i.e., someone like Michael Behe): that huge head has to be jammed through the female pelvis (why?  why not put the birth canal in just any other part of the female body?  You will find the answers in evolution, not intelligent design), resulting in difficult, very painful births compared to other animals, and high rates of mother & infant mortality & injury.  To this we can add literally years of painstaking childcare and teaching (compare to the large animals on the African savanna, who can stand and run within hours of being born) to train up the brain and the underdeveloped infant body, and a major energetic cost.The point is that someone using Behe's loose, arbitrary standards could pretty much argue that any evolutionary change was ""degradative.""  He isn't doing science, he's just name-calling.If we move to Behe's likely defense position, the situation doesn't improve.  Perhaps Behe would argue that ""breaking genes"" or ""decreasing substrate specificity"" are objectively degradative.  Perhaps, but if that's his standard, then his argument is easily disproven, because we have numerous examples of (a) evolution producing new genes with new functions and (b) evolution producing increases in substrate specificity.  Examples are easy to find, Behe likely won't even dispute this point since he knows it is true (unlike most ID advocates, incidentally), but here are references to reviews for those who are interested:Long, M., E. Betrán, K. Thornton, and W. Wang. 2003. The origin of new genes: glimpses from the young and old.

1,"Nadège Philippe, Estelle Crozat, Richard E. Lenski , Dominique Schneider, Evolution of global regulatory networks during a long-term experiment with Escherichia coli, BioEssays, Volume 29 Issue 9, Pages 846 - 860AbstractEvolution has shaped all living organisms on Earth, although many details of this process are shrouded in time. However, it is possible to see, with one's own eyes, evolution as it happens by performing experiments in defined laboratory conditions with microbes that have suitably fast generations. The longest-running microbial evolution experiment was started in 1988, at which time twelve populations were founded by the same strain of Escherichia coli. Since then, the populations have been serially propagated and have evolved for tens of thousands of generations in the same environment. The populations show numerous parallel phenotypic changes, and such parallelism is a hallmark of adaptive evolution. Many genetic targets of natural selection have been identified, revealing a high level of genetic parallelism as well. Beneficial mutations affect all levels of gene regulation in the cells including individual genes and operons all the way to global regulatory networks. Of particular interest, two highly interconnected networks - governing DNA superhelicity and the stringent response - have been demonstrated to be deeply involved in the phenotypic and genetic adaptation of these experimental populations.---Wow who would have guessed this from reading Behe's descriptions."
1,"2. Behe claims that normal evolutionary processes cannot, or are very unlikely, to produce irreducibly complex systems that make the cell ""reek of design.""  Behe, while he claims Lenski's work shows that evolution doesn't lead to new complexity and new systems, someone manages to avoid mentioning that that Lenski's E. coli bacteria were able to evolve a new biochemical pathway that could eat citrate, a chemical that E. coli in the wild cannot eat (Blount, Z.D., Borland, C.Z., and Lenski, R.E. 2008. Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A 105:7899-7906.).  Behe was forced to write a laughable response (    http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/post/PLNK3U696N278Z93O     ) that dodged the implications (evolution even in a limited lab population can produce a new beneficial system, i.e. an improvement that was not ""degradative""), but, as per his modus operandi, he will dance and redefine his terms rather than admit that his argument against evolution has been falsified.Unfortunately for Behe, Lenski's work is not isolated.  The adaptation of bacteria to eat substrates that are indigestible to the wild-type bacteria -- or even compounds that are toxic -- is an extremely common phenomenon in labs that has been known for decades.  And it is known to occur in the wild.  There are several cases where bacteria in the wild have developed the ability to break down compounds that purely anthropogenic -- that is, chemicals that did not exist in the environment until humans manufactured them.  For this very reason, these chemicals are often good preservatives (for example, wooden telephone polls) and/or highly toxic.  They are often considered pollutants in the soil or water, so a fair bit of work has gone into discovering what happens to them.  Again and again, the pattern seems to be that after a few decades, some bacterium has assembled a novel pathway -- always by assembling and modifying pre-existing enzymes with other original functions.  Well-known examples include nylon, PCP (pentachlorophenol, a preservative of e.g. wood), and 2,4-DNT (dinitrotoluene, a breakdown product of the explosive TNT, or trinitrotoluene, which is often a soil pollutant on military bases).  In at least the cases of PCP and 2,4-DNT, the breakdown pathways have multiple required parts, and therefore ought to be considered irreducibly complex (except that Behe will often dodge here also and invoke a ""strict"" definition of IC which excludes metabolic pathways, a definition which he invokes only when convenient, and which is arbitrary because the IC argument really only relies on the ""multiple required features, too improbable to evolve at once"" logic; in other situations he and his allies have declared various metabolic pathways to be IC when it seems to help the argument).One more alternative might be to say that evolution hasn't produced anything ""new"" in these situations, only re-used old parts.  This too would be the ID advocates sawing off the limb they sitting on; for every ""irreducibly complex"" system the ID guys like to tout as evidence for ID -- the flagellum, the cilium, the immune system, the blood-clotting cascade, etc. -- is basically just a combination of parts known to have other functions in related organisms or systems.  The parts have statistically strong sequence similarity, and sequence similarity is explained by copying, and copying of sequence is the result of gene duplication, which (along with subsequent modification) is the main explanation that evolutionary biologists have invoked for the origin of new genes and ""new information"" for generations.  The ID advocates have almost completely ignored this simple, obvious, well-documented, testable, and well-tested explanation for biological ""information"" and ""complexity"" for nearly 20 years now.  This demonstrates scientific incompetence and carelessness, and lends support to the view (which is undeniable but outside the scope of this post; read the Kitzmiller decision for some of that) that ID is not about good science at all, but really just a branch of conservative religious apologetics."
1,"To those unfamiliar with Nick Matzke, he was one of the (many) instrumental contributors to the success of the Kitzmiller v Dover ruling, as part of the plaintiffs' team. Not only has Nick contributed significantly to the unraveling of Behe's 'flagellum must have been designed' argument but he has also shown the evolution of ID from ""creationist"" via the intermediate fossil ""cdesign proponentsist"" to ""design proponent"". In fact, thanks to Nick Matzke and the plaintiffs' team, Behe's testimony during the Kitzmiller trials became useful evidence for the plaintiffs and the judge quoted extensively from Behe's testimony in his final ruling to show not only why the school board was motivated by religion but also that ID fails to be scientifically relevant.And of course, Nick has always been at the frontline of defending scientific competence and accuracy."
1,I understand that Michael Behe is one of the participants on this forum and I am looking forward to his contributions addressing Matzke's observations.
1,"Behe claims that --They can bring together separate components and place them in relationship to each other, to create an effect that may be extremely unlikely to occur by chance. So we detect design by inferring that some parts appear to have been arranged for a purpose.--Remember however that this addresses only chance and not regularity. In fact, it is regularity which helps us understand how design inferences work in real science where science deals in concepts such as means, motives and opportunities to narrow down the possibilities not by relying on chance but rather on an interplay of regularity and chance. How do we determine that a person was involved in a crime? Not by stating that 'chance and regularity' cannot explain the data thus designed. Few crimes if any have been solved in this manner, and that should come as no surprise since we would expect to see many innocent people locked up. Without however understanding motive, means and opportunities, one cannot easily make a design conclusion. Gary Hurd presented a good example of how the circumstance of our background knowledge can greatly affect our inference. The case involves an example in which a religious person was bitten by a snake. Initially this seemed to be just another accident, until the police found out that the snake was part of a snake charming ceremony in which the faithful handle snakes. While not as much an accident, it was also not a case of attempted homicide but it could be interpreted as an attempted suicide. After all, what person would willingly handle these poisonous snakes? But then the police found out that the woman was the wife of the preacher and that the preacher had just taken out a large life insurance for his wife. Now suddenly the police became suspicious. But was this evidence of murder or just a coincidence?ID's hypothesis would be useless in this case. Of course, ID proponents may argue that the design inference is not meant for all circumstances but I would argue that for rarefied design, it is unsuitable in any circumstance. Rarefied design is design which lacks the necessary information to constrain the explanatory power through relevant background data.In addition, while the concept of purpose is used by Behe, ID provides no way to determine purpose and in fact, due to its teleological nature, natural selection, which selects for function can be easily lead to apparent design. In fact, this returns us to the Paley problem namely that science replace our ignorance with scientific pathways to explain the evolution of life on earth. That subsequent data continued to strengthen these findings has made evolutionary theory such a powerful explanation. While ID has good reasons to want to return to the pre-Paleyian age, it presents no methods to differentiate between apparent and actual design. In fact, such a differentiation is never truly possible in case of the supernatural because one could always argue that the designer used nature for its design, just like the evidence suggests.In fact, ID does not infer purpose or a purposeful arrangement, it merely claims that design is that which remains when science has failed (so far) to explain a particular feature or system. However, to call our ignorance 'design' is just equivocating on concepts.So next time an ID proponent asserts that ID detects design through the purposeful arrangement of parts, let's remember that this is NOT how ID's methods work. "
1,"And worse, during the Dover trials, the judge came to conclude that based on the evidence presented---Judge Jones---We will now consider the purportedly “positive argument” for design encompassed in the phrase used numerous times by Professors Behe and Minnich throughout their expert testimony, which is the “purposeful arrangement of parts.” Professor Behe summarized the argument as follows: We infer design when we see parts that appear to be arranged for a purpose. The strength of the inference is quantitative; the more parts that are arranged, the more intricately they interact, the stronger is our confidence in design. The appearance of design in aspects of biology is overwhelming. Since nothing other than an intelligent cause has been demonstrated to be able to yield such a strong appearance of design, Darwinian claims notwithstanding, the conclusion that the design seen in life is real design is rationally justified. (18:90-91, 18:109-10 (Behe); 37:50 (Minnich)). As previously indicated, this argument is merely a restatement of the Reverend William Paley’s argument applied at the cell level. Minnich, Behe, and Paley reach the same conclusion, that complex organisms must have been designed using the same reasoning, except that Professors Behe and Minnich refuse to identify the designer, whereas Paley inferred from the presence of design that it was God. (1:6- 7 (Miller); 38:44, 57 (Minnich)). Expert testimony revealed that this inductive argument is not scientific and as admitted by Professor Behe, can never be ruled out. (2:40 (Miller); 22:101 (Behe); 3:99 (Miller)).Indeed, the assertion that design of biological systems can be inferred from the “purposeful arrangement of parts” is based upon an analogy to human design. Because we are able to recognize design of artifacts and objects, according to Professor Behe, that same reasoning can be employed to determine biological design. (18:116-17, 23:50 (Behe)). Professor Behe testified that the strength of the analogy depends upon the degree of similarity entailed in the two propositions; however, if this is the test, ID completely fails. Unlike biological systems, human artifacts do not live and reproduce over time. They are non-replicable, they do not undergo genetic recombination, and they are not driven by natural selection. (1:131-33 (Miller); 23:57-59 (Behe)). For human artifacts, we know the designer’s identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer’s abilities, needs, and desires. (D-251 at 176; 1:131-33 (Miller); 23:63 (Behe); 5:55- 58 (Pennock)). With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer’s identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. (38:44-47 (Minnich)). In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. (23:61-73 (Behe)). Professor Behe’s only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies. (23:73 (Behe)).It is readily apparent to the Court that the only attribute of design that biological systems appear to share with human artifacts is their complex appearance, i.e. if it looks complex or designed, it must have been designed. (23:73 (Behe)). This inference to design based upon the appearance of a “purposeful arrangement of parts” is a completely subjective proposition, determined in the eye of each beholder and his/her viewpoint concerning the complexity of a system. Although both Professors Behe and Minnich assert that there is a quantitative aspect to the inference, on cross-examination they admitted that there is no quantitative criteria for determining the degree of complexity or number of parts that bespeak design, rather than a natural process. (23:50 (Behe); 38:59 (Minnich)). As Plaintiffs aptly submit to the Court, throughout the entire trial only one piece of evidence generated by Defendants addressed the strength of the ID inference: the argument is less plausible to those for whom God’s existence is in question, and is much less plausible for those who deny God’s existence. (P- 718 at 705).---"
1,"Yes, when one sees a flower garden or Mount Rushmore for the first time, one assumes the object was created by an intelligent being.  However, this is not at all like looking at a biological mechanism and coming to a similar conclusion.  We are familiar with the capabilities of humans and know, when we see the flower garden or Mount Rushmore, that humans are all over the place in this world and completely capable of creating such things.  So it is not an unreasonable assumption that people made those things: we know they are capable and have created many similar things.However, people do not do such things as design eyes or flagelli.  A much better analogy would be if we saw an object that clearly looked designed (say, a carving of a human face) on another planet, where we know with great certainty that humans could not have created the object.  That some intelligent being created the object is one theory, but how would we go about vetting that theory?  We would look for evidence of that being or others like it.  If none could be found whatsoever, and plausible alternate explanations for how the shape, or similar shapes, can arise naturally are developed, the natural conclusion would be that while there was an *appearance* of design, there is no evidence to support the theory.This is the case for biological mechanisms.  No evidence of a designer has been given beyond that the mechanisms seem to be designed.  And evolution is very well established and explains well a great many biological mechanisms, including many that may look designed at first.  So we have our plausible alternative, and we have no evidence of the designer.

1,"It is also possible to ""detect design"" by reading what other experts say about so-called ""experts.""  For instance, while it is true to say that Michael Behe is a professor in the Biology Department at Lehigh University, it is also true that: ""The (Lehigh University Biology) department faculty, then, are unequivocal in their support of evolutionary theory, which has its roots in the seminal work of Charles Darwin and has been supported by findings accumulated over 140 years. The sole dissenter from this position, Prof. Michael Behe, is a well-known proponent of ""intelligent design."" -     http://www.lehigh.edu/bio/news/evolution.htm     Lehigh's entire Biology Department (with one exception) agrees with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Science, and essentially every other actual science organization in the country that intelligent design creationism is not science.Intelligent design creationism's claim to be ""science"" remains unsupported in the world of actual science.  Intelligent design creationism's continued visible support from fundamentalist Christians provides an illustration of what its actual design really is."
1,"Attempts to teach the creationism-evolution controversy to students are disingenuous promotions of activist Christians. Certainly, it sounds reasonable that creationism should taught in public schools in the context of it being a cultural/religious perspective? Who could argue with this? Many non believers would argue that creationism and Bible are wonderful literary works of fiction, and so, yes, they should be taught. Unfortunately those that uphold creationism as true cannot be satisfied with this because their doctrine drives them to require it to be taught as the truth. This is what many creationists are calling for in school systems. They frequently call for individuals classes to be created that teach ""creationism science"" as truth.
"
1,"Michael Behe may be best known for his book ""Darwin's Black Box"" and to a lesser extent its sequel ""The Edge of evolution"". Both books attempt to show that there limits (edges) to evolutionary theory which cannot be crossed.Let's first point out that much of Behe's argument is not with evolutionary theory itself but a component of said theory, namely natural selection. For instance, his Irreducible Complexity argument relies on the (erroneous) claim that processes of variation and selection (aka Darwinian processes) are unable to explain systems which are 'irreducibly complex (IC)"". In order to understand why Behe is wrong, one need not look further than     http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/behe.html    First of all the problem of IC systems and its solution was pointed out by a Nobel Prize winner and evolutionary scientist almost a century ago (    http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/ICsilly.html    )Muller, H. J. (1918) ""Genetic variability, twin hybrids and constant hybrids, in a case of balanced lethal factors."" Genetics 3:422-499. Muller, H. J. (1939) ""Reversibility in evolution considered from the standpoint of genetics."" Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society 14:261-280. ---    ""... thus a complicated machine was gradually built up whose effective working was dependent upon the interlocking action of very numerous different elementary parts or factors, and many of the characters and factors which, when new, were originally merely an asset finally became necessary because other necessary characters and factors had subsequently become changed so as to be dependent on the former. It must result, in consequence, that a dropping out of, or even a slight change in any one of these parts is very likely to disturb fatally the whole machinery; for this reason we should expect very many, if not most, mutations to result in lethal factors ...""    Muller 1918 pp. 463-464. (emphasis in the original)        ""... an embryological or physiological process or structure newly arisen by gene mutation, after becoming once established (with or without the aid of selection), later takes more and more part in the whole complex interplay of vital processes. For still further mutations that arise are now allowed to stay if only they work in harmony with all genes that are already present, and, of these further mutations, some will naturally depend, for their proper working, on the new process or structure under consideration. Being thus finally woven, as it were, into the most intimate fabric of the organism, the once novel character can no longer be withdrawn with impunity, and may have become vitally necessary.""    Muller 1939 pp. 271-272.---However, Keith Robison described a very similar example where simple evolutionary processes lead to a system which is IC  (    http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/behe/review.html    )--So, duplication plus a loss of function, plus one of two different loss-of-function mutations can convert a single step pathway into a two step cascade. The initial  steps are neutral, neither advantageous nor disadvantageous. Such neutral mutations occur regularly. The final step locks in the cascade.--ID's objections to the above scenario are that it involves neutral steps and are thus not 'Darwinian' in nature, but like Darwin, evolutionary science accepts that selection is but one of various processes and the importance of neutrality on evolution has been historically underestimated.Dembski, understanding one of Behe's flaws redefined IC to read--    A system performing a given basic function is irreducibly complex if it includes a set of well-matched, mutually interacting, nonarbitrarily individuated parts such that each part in the set is indispensable to maintaining the system's basic, and therefore original, function. The set of these indispensable parts is known as the irreducible core of the system. (No Free Lunch, 285)--Note the addition of 'original function', this prevents the most common pathways in evolution to be irrelevant to explaining IC systems, but now Dembski has to show that indeed, original function was maintained in any particular system. While this may have temporarily saved Behe's original fomulation, it has merely defined IC systems to be something which is much harder to establish as it involves a historical component of 'original function'."
1,"In his latest book ""Edge of Evolution"" Behe attempts to define this edge by pointing to malaria as an example of a designed system in which, according to Behe, two simultaneous mutations are required, and given the estimated probabilities of 1 in 10^20, this may be quite unlikely.First of all, Behe's estimate of probabilities come from a side comment in a paper which at best ventures to guess at probabilities :--The estimates for chloroquine and artemisinin are speculative. In the former case, this assumes two events in 10 years of use with exposure of 10% of the world’s falciparum malaria (Burgess &Young 1959; Martin&Arnold1968; Looareesuwan et al. 1996; Su et al. 1997 --and ignores the relevant research that shows the gradual evolution of resistance to malaria as document in various research papers:Pooja Mittra, Sumiti Vinayak, Hina Chandawat, Manoj K. Das, Neeru Singh, Sukla Biswas, Vas Dev, Ashwani Kumar, Musharraf A. Ansari, and Yagya D. Sharma, Progressive Increase in Point Mutations Associated with Chloroquine Resistance in Plasmodium falciparum Isolates from IndiaVolume 193(2006), pages 1304 - 1312For more details, see Nick Matzke's contribution    http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/10/full-text-of-th.html    "
2,"The following is a quote from your points: Quote ""The more parts that appear to be arranged for a purpose, and the more precisely they fit each other to achieve that purpose, the more and more confident we can be in our conclusion of design. For example, if you came across a broken stick on the ground in the woods that pointed toward a campsite, it may be a signal to campers, or it may just be a stick that happened to fall that way. If there were four broken sticks, arranged into an arrow shape pointing at the camp, you’d be fairly confident that that was no accident."" end QuoteSticks to the campsite:1. The current Calendar that makind has been using for 2008 years is based from the time of Christ's death, known as A.D. (After Death).2. The timeline used prior to Christ's death is B.C. (Before Christ).3. The Holy Bible is the most read text in the world and reprinted millions of times. There were plenty of scholars of the time that could have refuted and stopped this text from spreading. So you ask yourself why would such a text continue to this day? Is all that read it delusioned? Are the over a billion people on this planet mistaken about the existence of Intelligent Design? 4. Why do most people want to close their ears and even become defensive on the words printed in this text (Holy Bible)? When they don't even know what is in it. Why is mankind quick to embrace a different approach, but not the Bible which is an instruction manual from the chief I.D.?These are signs left behind for those who continue to question ID. "
1,"Behe says: ""Intelligent agents can plan ahead, and act on their plans.""If this is true, then there should always be a conscious effort to prevent lines of organisms from evolving into specialized forms that later become prone to extinction when a sudden change occurs in the environment. What happens instead, according to the fossil record, is that many spectacular but highly specialized animals arise which then suffer from mass extinctions, followed by new and different animals that end up occupying the same ecological niches the extinct ones did. If Intelligent Design made life on Earth, we would expect the designer to make all animals generalized in form and they would almost never go extinct. Evolution by natural selection is a blind process, taking no possible future events into account, that causes most lines of organisms to become more specialized over time. It does this so a species can occupy one ecological niche and keep other species out. When several species occupy the same ecological niche, competition between them eventually cause more specialization and/or causes most of the species to become extinct. Then a sudden change in the environment causes the remaining specialists to die out. That doesn't sound at all like an intelligent agent planning ahead."
2,"""So we detect design by inferring that some parts appear to have been arranged for a purpose.""Other inconvenient observations which bear inspection : purposefulness and intentionality. Here is that impermissible notion to the effect: ""personality is void of material and therefore personality is not worthy of  notable consideration by   science  ""Following that is dismissal and denial of  personal expressions and very often ad hominem character-assassination.We are forced to confront these challenges which in a more spiritual world might appear trivial or pathetic.  Be prepared which might advise be patient and have pity."
2,In order to have purposefulness and intentionality you need self-awareness. We are self-aware but where does that come from?
1,"In fact, Behe's claim is either tautological or it is wrong. Tautological because a Darwinian mechanism can never produce 'design' since design is the set theoretic complement of the disjunction regularity or chance, in other words design can never include scientific explanations or the design disappears. But perhaps Behe means that Darwinian mechanisms cannot explain what ID proponents have come to conclude were designed. That of course is a wrong statement because science not only can explain information and complexity, it can also explain perfectly natural pathways to irreducibly complex systems. In a recent change of heart, Behe has attempted, mostly based on overly simplistic arguments that evolution cannot explain certain specific aspects which he calls the ""edge of evolution"". Examples include a two site binding site. However, once again, Behe presents an overly simplistic strawman of evolution.I find it troubling how ID scientists have to ignore scientific data and findings to support their claims and instead seem to resort to careful cherry picking of data and facts that suit their purposes. An example is the malaria resistance which Behe argues must have happened in two independent steps without the possibility of intermediates when in fact the opposite is the case as papers in this area have documented. Others have similarly shown how Behe's claims are contradicted by the evidence. So far, ID seems to have ignored these evidences. And one still wonders why ID is considered to be scientifically vacuous by so many people, including many Christians. As a Christian and as a scientist I am appalled by the lack of scientific content of ID, but I am even more concerned by its dangerous theology which insists that God should be exposed to scientific disproof. After all, is that not what would happen if science were to show how a flagellum evolved? After all, the flagellum is argued to be 'designed' and since the design inference is 100% reliable lest it would be useless (Dembski), any scientific contributions which strengthen the already strong case of how the flagellum could have evolved, would undermine the concept of design, would it not?Well, not really, after all the concept of design is not about the existence of a designer but about scientific processes being unable to explain a particular system. Surprised? I bet many would be and in fact, many would accept the erroneous claim that disproving ID would disprove God. ID is unable to place any of its hypotheses at any danger since it is an argument based on a negative."
2,"""In fact, Behe's claim is either tautological or it is wrong.""And to think that you accuse US of promoting a false dichotomy. :/""Tautological because a Darwinian mechanism can never produce 'design' since design is the set theoretic complement of the disjunction regularity or chance, in other words design can never include scientific explanations or the design disappears.""So the only ""scientific"" explanations are ones which refer only to chance, law, or both, but not agency? Care to explain why? ""But perhaps Behe means that Darwinian mechanisms cannot explain what ID proponents have come to conclude were designed.""Pretty sure you can remove ""perhaps"" from that sentence. Behe spent the entire article explaining why he felt this was the case. He also pointed out why the excitement over the Lenski experiment should only be coming from our side. ""That of course is a wrong statement because science not only can explain information and complexity, it can also explain perfectly natural pathways to irreducibly complex systems.""Assuming that you're referring to materialistic science, I'm very eager to hear you explanation for how the first life emerged without resorting to any form of agency whatsoever. ""In a recent change of heart, Behe has attempted, mostly based on overly simplistic arguments that   evolution   cannot explain certain specific aspects which he calls the ""edge of evolution"".""This is not a ""change of heart,"" Behe has been stating for quite some time now that there are certain aspects of living systems which are beyond the reach of chance and necessity. EoE was just a more detailed explanation for where the edge lies based on data from HIV and whatnot. ""Examples include a two site binding site. However, once again, Behe presents an overly simplistic strawman of evolution.""See the above point. This conclusion was not based on a straw man, it was based on existing data from HIV (which has a mutation rate that some would call the evolutionary speed limit), E. coli, Malaria, etc. Doesn't seem to be any straw man there. ""I find it troubling how ID scientists have to ignore scientific data and findings to support their claims and instead seem to resort to careful cherry picking of data and facts that suit their purposes.""I'll drive the point again for the third time: his conclusions where based on existing data widely cited in the field of biology, if you can direct us all to experiments that show HIV, E. coli, Malaria, etc. are capable of more than what the studies he cites suggest, then it would prove he engaged in cherry picking. ""An example is the malaria resistance which Behe argues must have happened in two independent steps without the possibility of intermediates when in fact the opposite is the case as papers in this area have documented.""Just where on earth did he say it had to happen in two steps? I see in the book right now (hardcover) citing data for how often Malaria gains chloroquine resistance, but where'd you get the claim of a two-step change?""Others have similarly shown how Behe's claims are contradicted by the evidence.

2,"""And one still wonders why ID is considered to be scientifically vacuous by so many people, including many Christians.""Yes, I most definitely do wonder why it is held to already have been falsified. What doesn't surprise me is that certain theistic critics happen to resurrect the same tired arguments over and over again. Especially when some of them (such as Ken Miller) decide to use them under oath:  http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/idea-co-founder-disembowels-ken-millers-strawman  /""As a Christian and as a scientist I am appalled by the lack of scientific content of ID, but I am even more concerned by its dangerous theology which insists that God should be exposed to scientific disproof.""I guess I can believe the christian part, you do seem to be following Ken Miller's model of debate. But why are you accusing ID of bringing god into the debate when clearly articles on this site by ID'ers discourage this, and then you yourself decide to engage in the same thing? No one on here is trying to say that the existence of the judeo-christian god is a scientific question, rather ID claims that it's possible to detect whether or not a feature of the natural world is likely to have arisen by an undirected process or a pre-planned one. ""After all, is that not what would happen if science were to show how a flagellum evolved?""Have you guys come up with anything better then Matzke co-authoring a paper explaining that parts just popped into existence out of nowhere and just so happening to magically arrange themselves in the right location, the right order, the right changes in function, the right interface-compatibility, etc. And to answer your question; no, a belief in a supernatural omni-potent entity (which I don't personally have) is not automatically falsified by showing that some particular feature of the natural world can arise without any intelligent intervention. The reason for this is because no one can say for sure how such a god would operate, and if the ONLY thing they would do is create flagella on various cells. ""After all, the flagellum is argued to be 'designed' and since the design inference is 100% reliable lest it would be useless (Dembski), any scientific contributions which strengthen the already strong case of how the flagellum could have evolved, would undermine the concept of design, would it not?""See the above point.""Well, not really, after all the concept of design is not about the existence of a designer but about scientific processes being unable to explain a particular system.

""I bet many would be and in fact, many would accept the erroneous claim that disproving ID would disprove God.""Not unless they assumed that ID was the only basis for a belief in a god of sorts (which ID'ers are not telling people to assume).""ID is unable to place any of its hypotheses at any danger since it is an argument based on a negative.""If ID were based on the negative argument that   evolution   can't produce something, therefore it was design, then ID'ers would insist the rings around Saturn were designed for the same reason since no form of Darwin's theory could produce them. Of course this is not what they would ever even remotely consider, so why assume it's just a matter of contrived dualism?"

For one thing, they are bigger — twice as big on average as their common ancestor. They are also far better at reproducing in these flasks, dividing 70 percent faster than their ancestor.

1,"Teaching creationism is comparable to teaching flat earthism. The scientific consensus against creationism is as strong as against ""flat earthism"".

Where is Ron Paul when you REALLY need him?""Surely, the imperfect nature of the mechanism here is what we would expect as 'work in progress' from natural selection rather than design?""It's definitely what we would expect from evolutionary processes. This is not a feature we attribute to design."
1,"The only thing I take issue with in this argument is the comments about Lenski's work with e. coli.  I am not a scientist, but I was able to read Lenski's paper and understand it.  The paper was SPECIFICALLY about how the mutation allowing e. coli to begin metabolizing citrase (the Cit+ mutation) was dependent on some other prior mutation(s) that opened the evolutionary pathway.  Lenski published without having identified the exact prior mutation, simply because of how exciting this result is.  Let me make this perfectly clear, in case you don't want to read Lenski's paper:  The evolution of the Cit+ e. coli required one or more mutations that may not have affected the survivability of the e. coli population.  This means that e. coli which was unable to eat citrates, mutated at least twice, changing it's chemical nanotechnology once, in a manner that may not have affected the survivability of the population, then later, a mutation allowed the bacteria to make use of an alternate food source.This experiment IS the 'smoking gun.'  We have observed evolution in the lab.  We can repeat it.  We can make predictions based on it.  Darwinian evolutionary science does not explain design, because it was never meant to.  It explains exactly what we see, in the fossil record, in our own DNA, and now, in the lab:  Small inheritable random variations accumulate over vast numbers of generations to modify organisms, raising the possibility of their gene's survival to the maximum."
1,"Mr. Behe makes two key claims in this short essay. 1) That mutations ""tended to be degradative changes, ones which destroyed genes or made them less efficient.""which he uses as an argument to his conclusion, that 2) ""Darwin’s mechanism of random mutation and natural selection does not mimic design""However, there is a fundamental flaw in Mr. Behe's reasoning in regards to the first point, which leads to his erroneous conclusion. All mutations can be regarded as 'degradative' in some sense, but they are constructive in a different sense, because mutations involve a fitness trade-off. We know a prori that E. coli is very well adapted to its natural habitat. After 3.5 billion years of evolution, it is unfathomably unlikely that in .00000001 % of that time we will see natural selection produce and adaptation that is a pareto improvement on the function of E. coli, that is: an improvement with no cost. The only reason we see any beneficial mutations whatsoever is because we are placing E. coli in an evolutionarily novel habitat, where some of E. coli's genes are unnecessary, and where it lacks some functions which would be beneficial.   By way of analogy, if I took a coat hanger from my closet, bent it, and turned it into a well formed T.V. antenna, I would have greatly decreased the hangers ability to hold a coat. But if I don't need a coat hanger, and I do need an antenna, it is difficult to see how we can describe transforming a coat hanger into an antenna as ""degradative"", since the antenna has a highly specified from that looks just as designed as the coat hanger.  If I choose to regard all improvements which are not pareto improvement as 'degradative', then I would not expect to ever find evidence for evolution. Evolution works by making trade offs, destroying one thing to make a more immediately useful thing. So, because Mr. Behe confuses the kinds of improvements that natural selection makes with universal improvements in function. Because of this he sees no evidence for natural selection's ability to improve organismal function. The key test of Mr. Behe's characterization of the E. coli's cit+ mutations as 'degradative' will come when the mutations are fully characterized and we discover whether or not the novel proteins, which have unarguably be created by natural selection, function efficiently for cit+ metabolism. Putatively, I believe, a gene duplication has occurred, such that the cit+ E. coli have not lost any ancestral function.When these mutations are characterized and we have again documented natural selection creating novel cellular machinery, it may aid in preserving Mr. Behe credibility if he acknowledges that natural selection can create efficient cellular machinery. "
1,"is a common creationist position which misunderstand that most mutations are mostly neutral, few are strongly detrimental and some are beneficial. Now remember that the definition of the effect of mutations depends strongly on the environment, and that what is beneficial or detrimental or neutral in one environment can take on a different 'shape' in another environment.In general, mutations or more commonly known as variations, are incredibly important for evolution, since without such variation, evolution would not be able to do much of anything. So, in fact, variation is an important component to evolutionary theory and mutations are one way of variation to increase, but other mechanisms such as recombination can also increase the variation in the species by mixing and matching parts of genomes.This is one reason why Behe's claims about the edge of evolution are so poorly supported by fact and theory. Behe argues for instance that evolution is unable to explain two or more mutations because he insists that they have to happen at the same time. His argument is that intermediates do not exist and if they do, they do not have any beneficial advantage and thus are impervious to selection. So let's explore this with an example in which a mutation A and B are necessary for a particular beneficial event to happen (such as malaria resistance) and lets assume that A and B by themselves have near neutral fitness contributions in a particular environment. In Behe's world, this would mean that a population either has AB mutation or neither A nor B. However in reality, we know that populations exhibit a significant variability in which there will be some that will have a mutation A and others a mutation B but since these mutations are by themselves neutral, they can only spread to fixation via drift. This means small populations or a bottle neck or a selective sweep.However since A or B are already part of a subset of the population, all they need is another mutation event B or A, to suddenly expose a strongly selective advantage. The probability of such an event can be increased when A or B has come to fixation piggy backing on another selective event.Not only does this affect Behe's simplistic calculcations but in real life we actually have evidence of the existence of the many intermediates between no resistance to  to full resistance. In other words, we can observe the individual steps through which this resistance could have evolved. In other words, the suggestion that intermediates are without any selective value is shown to be erroneous.As to gene duplication and co-option, the reason why we see evolution re-using so many 'modules' is simple. Evolving a system of n components can reduce to a log(n) time when modules are re-used. So in case of 1000 components, this would reduce the time  from O(n) to O(log n) or from 10^n to n. Not a bad reduction in time would you not agree? This was what Herbert Simon argued in his early 20th century papers on complexity and modularity. And one should not be surprised that we have found at many levels of life, that scale free networks and hierarchical networks govern. "
1,"I apologize for using misleading wording. You are right in that the majority of mutation appear to have little or no effect on survival in most organisms. My point was simply that any mutation which does produce a notable prototypic effect (which is simply any mensurable change for any non-biologist out there), can be viewed as a negative change in some particular environment. For organisms with very simple and efficient genomes well adapted to a particular environment that change will likely be a negative one in their ancestral environment. Kudos on dragging out the statistical fallacies in Mr. Behe's most recent popular work. I find your reference to Simon work particularly fascinating. Whether serial duplication would be useful or not depends on whether there is any similarity between various good designs, which there empirically are for almost any designed object I can think of. In conclusion, scale free networks are cool."
1,Prototypic should read phenotypic. Darn spell checker. 
1,"as much as Behe's somewhat misleading--Yet, when Lenski tracked down the mutations, they tended to be degradative changes, ones which destroyed genes or made them less efficient. That is not the sort of process one needs to build complex molecular systems.--Your comments showed that you also understand that fitness is not determined by a single cause/effect. For instance, while some mutations may cause a fitness decrease in one aspect of the organism and an increase in another, the overall effect may thus be very well positive. To call the change degenerative misses the point.I hope to report more on Hubert Simon's work, quite interesting."
1,"""For example, humans have acquired a number of helpful genetic changes in our battle with the malarial parasite over the past ten thousand years. The most well-known of these is the sickle cell mutation, which unfortunately can also lead to the lethal side effect of sickle cell disease. Other mutations that are helpful in the fight with malaria also degrade or destroy genes, such as globin genes and the genes for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, Duffy antigen, and Band 3 protein.""I wanted to clarify two points in this paragraph, first 'a number' is a little vague – there’s a lot. For example, over 160 G6PD deficiency variants have been categorised worldwide, these are just the common ones people have bothered publishing on. Dozens of other genes have been highlighted in candidate gene and linkage studies.Second, Sickle is famous because of the nasty disease/geographical distribution but there are at other goblin variants that cause fewer symptoms. It is maintained in the population because it is so effective at preventing malaria. Much of the variation linked to malaria susceptibility has more modest effects. Third, some variants modulate function without causing any health problems, for example Duffy negative variant - which prevents expression only on red blood cells, but not other cell types, and causes no health problems. That’s more than throwing a spanner into the machine, its targeting a promoter sequence with a rather subtle change.Fourth, some variants altering malaria susceptibility - generate or boost function - variation at the MHC locus, ABO glycosyltransferase or hereditary hypersplenism. It is even possible that selection for surviving the metabolic challenge of severe malaria, has inadvertently selected for the athletic abilities of African populations – but that’s more speculative!."
1,"Because students are impressionable, if you teach them the literal truth of Genesis as science, they may well believe you. Since you are wrong, this is not to be welcomed, particularly since what your teaching involves is a wilful misunderstanding of the nature of scientific method, with implications for their understanding of science in general for the rest of their lives. The fact that more than half of all Americans believe that the world was created by God in seven days is a testament to political pressure from Christians to water down the science curriculum, and it is harmful - because it is wrong. We may allow children to be sent to faith schools, but we do not allow those schools to teach them whatever they like.

1,"for educating us about the immense scientific amount of information that seldomly gets disseminated when ID proponents claim that 'x' could not have evolved. It's this lack of sufficient familiarity with the prevailing knowledge which has rendered ID so meaningless. Whether it is the poor scholarship by Wells or the meaningless arguments by Behe, they all seem to come down to a similar commonality: a lack of full understanding of the scientific knowledge and evidence.How does ID explain the malaria resistance or the bacterial flagellum? We already know how poorly ID has done with the flagellum, now that science keeps unraveling facts in support of predictions made several years earlier by Nick Matzke."
1,"Remember Nick Matzke? A few years ago, he outlined based on an extensive study of the scientific literature and homology studies a plausible scenario for the evolution of the bacterial flagellum.The title was ""Evolution in (Brownian) space: a model for the origin of the bacterial flagellum""    http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/flagellum.html   In this article, Nick outlined various predictions and now we have received the exciting news that science has found supporting evidence for his predictionsAnother touch down for science.Mark Pallen, one of several experts, has written two articles in which he outlines not only how ID has remained scientifically without content in describing the bacterial flagellum, the hallmark evidence of design according to ID, but also how science has developed a level of knowledge which has removed yet another cloud of ignorance, and thus further dismantling the 'design inference'.   http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/09/mark-pallen-on.html   When will ID proponents admit that Behe was wrong and that 'design' has been disproven? Dispatches from the cutting edge of flagellar biology, part 1   http://roughguidetoevolution.blogspot.com/2008/09/dispatches-from-cutting-edge-of.html   Dispatches from the cutting edge of flagellar biology, part 2   http://roughguidetoevolution.blogspot.com/2008/09/dispatches-from-cutting-edge-of_17.html   --In 2003, Nick Matzke (then at the NCSE and so a couple of years later science adviser to the plaintiffs in the Dover trial) wrote an essay summarising plausible evolutionary scenarios for the origin of the bacterial flagellum. He noted a couple of previous suggestions that the proto-flagellum might have originated from the F-type ATPase. Crucially, he predicted that additional homologies would be found between components of the F-type ATPase and the flagellar protein export apparatus, for example between the b subunit of the ATPase and FliH and between the delta subunit and FliJ. In 2006, I confirmed one of Nick's hunches through homology searches, showing that part of FliH was homologous to the b subunit. However, things turned out slightly different from Nick's predictions in that FliH is actual of a fusion of domains homologous to the b subunit and the delta subunit.Last year Namba's group published the structure of FliI and confirmed the striking homology with the F-type ATPase enzymatic subunits. At that stage in the game, it had become clear that the ATPase was a universal component not just of flagellar export systems but also of non-flagellar type III secretion systems. Also, if it was also clear that if one knocked out the gene for FliI, one abolished flagellar biosynthesis. Thus, just about everyone in the field accepted that FliI was an essential component of the flagellar apparatus and that it energised secretion of proteins through the protein export system. In other words, if there were anything to the idea, put forward by Behe and others in the ID movement, that the flagellum showed ""irreducible complexity"", even experts might have accepted that FliI was one of the ""irreducible"" components!!BUT earlier this year, Minamino and Namba (and independently a team headed by Kelly Hughes in the US) overturned all our assumptions by showing that it was perfectly possible to make flagella without FliI--what you needed to do was knock out FliH at the same time. Somehow or other FliH, which usually interacts with FliI, gums up the export apparatus in the absence of FliI. So, bang goes another pillar of support for the ID argument! In fact, it appears that flagellar protein export is powered not primarily by the ATPase by the proton-motive force. ..He provided a run through of all the work leading up to his recent Nature article on the dispensibility of FliI. I was then very proud to see him cite my paper on the FliH/F-type ATPase homology. But then he provided the final piece in the jigsaw (and Nick Matzke's ears should prick up at this point)!Namba and colleagues have now solved the structure of FliJ, another protein that interacts with FliI and FliH. And what they found was clear evidence of homology with yet another protein from the F-type ATPase--the gamma subunit!--So in other words, science supported two predictions by Nick Matzke and showed how Flil was not an essential part of flagellar function, even though knocking it out would prevent the flagellum from forming, when in addition to Flil also FliH was knocked out, the flagellum formed.What a day in history"
2,Science was able to intelligently design flagellar function.
1,"Science did not design the functionality, scientists observed the functionality and developed theories on how it function / how that function came about."
1,"--Behe--If “scientific merit” is judged by the correspondence between theory and physical reality, then the theory of intelligent design rates very strongly.--There is no theory of ID, what's so hard to understand here. The concept of ""purposeful arrangement of parts"" is at best a restatement of Paley's argument and fails to recognize scientific explanations. As to the flagellum simulations, let's make sure that it is actually based on the actual pictures rather than a stylized representation. After all, we do not want to pretend that the physical reality looks like a cartoon."
1,"the physical reality to which Behe so proudly points is a stylized cartoon of reality. Sure we can make designed things look designed but the actual flagellum hardly looks like the strawmen pictures by ID. Since ID seems to want to make its argument based on the similarity between a non-existent theory and physical reality, it seems to me that there are some 'minor' wrinkles to be worked out."
1,"""Design is recognized in the purposeful arrangement of parts, ""Storms - tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.. - are machines.  They are made up of many necessary, purposefully-arranged parts, they are described explicitly by scientists as engines, they are irreducibly complex, they have countless more molecules than a cell, they are in their own ways as complicated and intricate as a cell, they cannot be replicated in a lab, they have all the hallmarks that Behe claims precludes any natural origin.  But they arise spontaneously all the time.Behe's argument amounts to ""it looks that way to me, thus design"".  This argument fails on so many levels.  The matter of meteorological phenomena is but one example that reveals the weakness of the ID position."
2,"I'm sorry but this argument of ""design is apparent, not real"" always make me scratch my head in bewilderment.Its like, we see the design with our own eyes but it can't be real because we refuse to believe in a designer. You were right about one thing Arthur Hunt. Storms- tornadoes, hurricanes, etc are machines with engines.It always has been and always will be impossible to have a design without a designer. Truth doesn't stop being truth just because you don't believe it. Just because something arises spontaneously doesn't disprove a designer. "
1,"--It always has been and always will be impossible to have a design without a designer. Truth doesn't stop being truth just because you don't believe it. Just because something arises spontaneously doesn't disprove a designer--true, but as science has shown, the designer need not always be an intelligent entity and in fact, this confusion about design which lies at the foundation of apparent versus actual design has not been resolved by the eliminative approach chosen by ID. It has nothing to do with a believe in a designer, a perhaps innate, evolved aspect of humans, but all to do with what is scientifically supportable. Needless to say, we do not use ID's approaches to infer design since such an approach would be inherently unreliable."
2,...all design is intelligent. It takes thought to construct any type of design. When you see things take place in science they happen because of all the laws that were put into place by an intelligent designer.Going back to the idea of a storm and engines. When you get in a car and turn the key you have a spontaneous violent storm erupt inside the engine. It all takes place because of all the elements of the design working in concert to produce the effect. This and all design requireintelligent thought.

You ask some good questions and since you 'see design', you may be horrified to find out how the Intelligent Design movement has defined design to be nothing more than the ""set theoretic complement of the disjunction regularity-or-chance"" or that which remains once one has eliminate regularity of chance hypotheses.Shocked?... I bet but things get worse, in order to go from design to 'designer', the ID movement uses induction, which of course has its usual problems---Ryan Nichols--Before I proceed, however, I note that Dembski makes an important concession to his critics. He refuses to make the second assumption noted above. When the EF implies that certain systems are intelligently designed, Dembski does not think it follows that there is some intelligent designer or other. He says that, ""even though in practice inferring design is the first step in identifying an intelligent agent, taken by itself design does not require that such an agent be posited. The notion of design that emerges from the design inference must not be confused with intelligent agency"" --The notion of design should not be confuse with intelligent agency. Now how many ID proponents or enthusiasts are familiar with this hidden gem?Let's give an example of (failed) intelligent design. When Newton arrived at his laws of motion, he was shocked when he realized that the orbits of planets could not possibly be stable. To 'explain' the stable orbits, Newton invoked a ""helping hand"" of God. Only when Laplace, some half a century later, realized Newton's mistakes, was the necessity of said intelligent designer removed.Newton's appeal to design is based on what ID proponents have come to define as the ""design inference"".This should teach us once and for all that an appeal to design, when lacking anything more than ignorance, is not very reliable, historically speaking.Does this help? Do you have a paypal account? Oh what the heck, this one is on me...;-)"
1,"If something can arise spontaneously, then a designer certainly isn't proven--what is proven is that a designer is unnecessary.I firmly believe that you should be able to believe whatever you want about god/religion, but on the other hand, once it's established that a designer is unnecessary, it does not serve anyone to say ""because we don't know this, this, and this, therefore it must mean there was a supernatural force that set it in motion, and we should stop looking for the answer.""Irreducible complexity was shattered a couple of decades ago. Since then, we've answered previously unknown questions about eyes, missing links, plant buds, and all the other gaps. If we had stopped looking, we wouldn't know--and that, I think, is the true danger of Intelligent Design. It not only halts knowledge, it canonizes ignorance."

My grounds for objection are very simple:  This is not an argument.The whole post from Mr Behe can be boiled down to, ""since things are complex, they must be designed.""In another post I said that ID wasn't a theory, it was an untested hypothesis.  It seems I was giving it too much credit.  It's an unfinished hypothesis.What features of the complexity of the cell points to intelligent design?

To make it an argument, he would have to say, ""Cellular machinery is complex, and these examples of complexity make me think it is designed.""  Then he would speak to each of those examples in detail, explaining why their complexity indicates design, and is not better explained through some other mechanism.  That would be an argument.  ICDESIGN, I have had these discussions, representing both sides, too many times to be derailed by your question.

For example, some complex electronic circuits are designed by engineers and others are created through the use of adaptive programs that amount to artificial versions of natural selection. Both kinds of circuits work, but they have distinctly different characteristics. The designed circuits tend to be less tolerant of malfunctions than the evolved circuits and it's much harder to figure out how the undesigned circuits work. In other words, when nature is examined, it appears to be undesigned. This is a positive finding, not a inference. None of this will convince the ID folks, of course, because they are irrational religionists. "

1,"I believe arguments from the opposing camps that say 'it looks like it was designed, so it must have been designed' and 'natural selection could have produced it, so we believe natural selection did produce it' are not going to lead to resolution of this issue.The real question is - Is there any direct evidence that a particular feature actually was designed, or on the other hand, direct evidence that it arose through natural selection? This is clearly a very difficult question or to answer when the events took place long ago (pace YECs)On the ID side, I'm not aware of any evidence that any feature of any organism actually was designed. This would require evidence that a) designers existed b) they visited earth and c) they intervened in the modification of life.On the evolution by natural selection side, likewise I'm not aware if there is any evidence that a significant new feature, such as the human brain, actually did evolve this way. I think at the moment it's impossible to demonstrate either of these with direct evidence. So for me the next question is - in the absence of direct evidence either way, is it possible to say whether or not ID has merit?I think it is. This is because, as I understand it, ID makes no proposals as to the nature of the designers, when and how they designed life, why they don't appear to be around today, and what their own origin was. This means it is not really a theory, more a kind of problem statement.For evolution by natural selection, there is a proposed mechanism, which has been proven to work on small scale changes (point mutations). Other mechanisms are known that can modify the genome on a larger scale. Natural selection therefore doesn't have the blank spaces that ID does, and in my view has the right to be called a theory."
1,"Behe asserts:""Design is recognized in the purposeful arrangement of parts""Who decides if an ""arrangement of parts"" is ""purposeful""?  What does ""purposeful"" really mean in that statement?

Why would a designer design one organism within another organism? And why would he do this common, foreign cellular power source for animals, fungi, and plants?

So why is ID different? Because they want to replace or extend MN by something 'supernatural', however since the supernatural lacks as an explanation, they have to confuse the issue by making flawed claims about science rejecting design and purpose at all cost.Jay's argument fails even worse when discussing Newton or Keppler stating--Methodological naturalism, for instance, would exclude most of the founders of modern science, including Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton. That should strike you as fishy.--And yet, these people were following methodological naturalism, except in the case when Newton believed that his inability to understand the stability of orbits of planets was best explained by an Intelligent Designer interfering regularly to correct their orbits. It took half a decade or so for LaPlace to correct this flawed 'design inference'.Openmindedness does not mean that one should accept any argument that's more closer to a concept better know as gullibility. Is there evidence for ID in nature. Surely ID does not really tell, all they do is call our ignorance 'design' and then conflate the terminology with how people more commonly interpret this terminology. Bait and switch. Lacking any foundation that constrains their hypothesis, ID is doomed to scientific irrelevance, and anyone openminded would have to admit this. In fact, several ID proponents have admitted to the lack of a foundation for ID.So it is clear that Jay is wrong to argue that science rejects design a-priori, After all, the Discovery Institute argues that ID must be science because other sciences also infer design. So, for science to reject ID, it must be because it fails to contribute. Not because it is wrong, it is not even that, it's just vacuous.Is intelligent design science? Does it matter? ID lacks any non trivial scientific contribution, other than perhaps making the flawed claim that science and methodological naturalism somehow deny purpose and design or that MN would reject Newton and Keppler.

Steve Fuller was for some strange reasons, an expert witness for the defense, but most of his testimony served the plaintiffs quite well.

Enjoy--.I am, says Fuller, ignorant (sheerly so; this is the glaring deficiency in my case) of ""ID's argument structure"", which is - argument to the best explanation! Oh pul-eese! I ignored this bit in my review out of a kind of residual collegiality, for even among the toxicities that flow when members of the professoriate fall out, embarrassment on others"" behalf is a restraint. But he asks for it. Argument to the best explanation! Look: there is a great deal we do not know about this world of ours, but what is beautiful about science is that its practitioners do not panic and say ""cripes! we don't understand this, so we must grab something quick - attribute it to the intelligent designing activity of Fred (or Zeus or the Tooth Fairy or any arbitrary supernatural agency given ad hoc powers suitable to the task) because we can't at present think of a better explanation."" They do not make a hasty grab for a lousy ""best explanation"" because they have serious thoughts about the kind of thing that can count as such. Instead of quick ad hoc fixes, they live with the open-ended nature of scientific enquiry, hypothesising and testing, trying to work things out rationally and conservatively on the basis of what is so far well-attested and secure. What looks like having a chance of being both an ""explanation"" and the ""best"" in a specific case turns on there being a well-disciplined idea of ""best"" for that specific case. But an hypothesis has no hope of becoming the best explanation (until a better comes along) unless it survives testing, is specific, and is consistent and conservative with respect to much else that is secure. This is a far cry from the gestural ""best explanation"" move that ID theorists attempt, which - and note this carefully - does not restrict itself to individual puzzles only, but applies to Life, the Universe and Everything. It has to, at risk of incoherence; and yet by doing so, it collapses into incoherence.--Read the rest at     http://newhumanist.org.uk/1881    "
2,"I agree!  One of the main purposes of science is to discover truth or should be anyway.  To decide what that truth is or limit it as to what it can or cannot be before even beginning the search, defeats the purpose.  That is strange.  Why would anyone who is really interested in the truth want to do this? This point is as clear as day to most people and I believe this is why so many people favor open debate on the issue.  Only Darwinists want to censor the debate.If there can be evidence against design, then, certainly, like you said, there can be evidence for design.We need to be open to follow the evidence where ever it leads and not predetermine where it can and cannot lead us.  That is not true science.  This kind of solid logic will resonate with a lot of people and help them see through the rhetoric of the evolutionists.Good points!tj"

1,"The first point stressed in my college biology class was in fact that we as scientists cannot ascribe purpose to chemical and biological functions. One can only observe and describe the complex functions that occur in biology. I have heard theologists describe the human as a perfect being that could only be the result of an intelligent designer. The human body is far from perfect especially with regard to his physiology. The human lung is relatively inefficient and the lungs of birds are far superior in associating Oxygen with blood cells. When ID attempts to account for observable biological complexity it falls back on a designer, but if beings are the result of   intelligent design   what created the designer? Evolution attempts to explain the origin of life and the process through which current species came to manifest themselves. ID excludes the designer from the explanation for life on earth. This implies that the designer be other worldly or supernatural/martian. ID doesn't offer new evidence it merely relies on the gaps in current evolutionary knowledge. Even worse is the fact that ID and so called ""Creation Science"" have their roots in the idiotic notion that evolution contradicts the second law of Thermodynamics. "

1,"--IslandThe WMAP anamoly indicates that we are at the center of the universe:   http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29210    ---Where in the article is this argument proposed?From the conclusions--Therefore, there is strong evidence either of some systematic error in the WMAP pipeline (although in a preliminary analysis, the team is now discovering similar features in COBE maps), or that the largest scales of the microwave sky are dominated by a local foreground.This finding has vast implications. It casts doubts on the cosmological interpretation of the lowest-1 multipoles from the temperature-temperature correlation and from the temperature-polarization correlation, and in turn on the claim that the first stars formed very early in the history of the universe. --I can see how Island may have jumped to the conclusion hereFrom Wikipedia--Lawrence Krauss is quoted as follows in the referenced Edge.org article:[8]    But when you look at CMB map, you also see that the structure that is observed, is in fact, in a weird way, correlated with the plane of the earth around the sun. Is this Copernicus coming back to haunt us? That's crazy. We're looking out at the whole universe. There's no way there should be a correlation of structure with our motion of the earth around the sun — the plane of the earth around the sun — the ecliptic. That would say we are truly the center of the universe.It would be somewhat surprising if the WMAP alignments were a complete coincidence, but the anti-Copernican implications suggested by Krauss would be far more surprising, if true. Other possibilities are (i) that residual instrumental errors in WMAP cause the effect (ii) that unexpected microwave emission from within the solar system is contaminating the maps.[9]--"
1,"Island referenced a 2004 article, however science does proceed and indeed--Abstract: We apply the recently defined multipole vector framework to the frequency-specific first-year WMAP sky maps, estimating the low-l multipole coefficients from the high-latitude sky by means of a power equalization filter. While most previous analyses of this type have considered only heavily processed (and foreground-contaminated) full-sky maps, the present approach allows for greater control of residual foregrounds, and therefore potentially also for cosmologically important conclusions. The low-l spherical harmonics coefficients and corresponding multipole vectors are tabulated for easy reference.Using this formalism, we re-assess a set of earlier claims of both cosmological and non-cosmological low-l correlations based on multipole vectors. First, we show that the apparent l=3 and 8 correlation claimed by Copi et al. (2004) is present only in the heavily processed map produced by Tegmark et al. (2003), and must therefore be considered an artifact of that map. Second, the well-known quadrupole-octopole correlation is confirmed at the 99% significance level, and shown to be robust with respect to frequency and sky cut. Previous claims are thus supported by our analysis. Finally, the low-l alignment with respect to the ecliptic claimed by Schwarz et al. (2004) is nominally confirmed in this analysis, but also shown to be very dependent on severe a-posteriori choices. Indeed, we show that given the peculiar quadrupole-octopole arrangement, finding such a strong alignment with the ecliptic is not unusual. --Authors: P. Bielewicz, H. K. Eriksen, A. J. Banday, K. M. Gorski, P. B. LiljeTitle: Multipole vector anomalies in the first-year WMAP data: a cut-sky analysisAstrophys.J. 635 (2005) 750-760Conclusions:--In this paper, we have revisited a set of claims found in the literature regarding the low-? CMB pattern and multipole vectors. We have remedied the most serious outstanding problem connected to these analyses, in that we have used only partial sky data to estimate the multipole vectors. This allowed us to study the frequency-speciﬁc WMAP sky maps individually, while imposing different sky cuts to study regional dependence. Using these methods, the multipole vector approach may ﬁnally be used for cosmological analysis. Three claims were studied in depth. First, Copi et al. (2004) found a set of strong correlations among the ? = 2, . . . , 8 multipoles using the multipole vector formalism. Unfortunately, they only had access to two full-sky maps (the WILC and TOH sky maps), which are known to be contaminated by galactic foregrounds. While we reproduced their results for these two maps, we also found that the anomaly is not present in the best available frequency-speciﬁc CMB maps. Therefore, as far as the low-? correlations are statistically signiﬁcant, they must be considered an artifact of the TOH and WILC sky maps, and not of the WMAP data as a whole. Second, we revisited the much more established anomaly ﬁrst reported by de Oliveira-Costa et al. (2004); the strong alignment between the quadrupole and octopole moments. Our results conﬁrm previous conclusions: The effect is signiﬁcant at the 98-99% conﬁdence level, and independent of frequency and sky cut. It appears to be quite robust. Finally, we also considered the claims made by Schwarz et al. (2004), that the low-? CMB ﬁeld could be of solar system origin. This claim was based on the observation that the ? = 2 and 3 multipole cross-product vectors align with the ecliptic north-south axis, and, indeed, that they point towards the vernal equinox. While the nominal signiﬁcance of these results are conﬁrmed in this paper, we also found that it is not at all unusual to observe such a strong alignment with one of the three major axes (ecliptic, galactic or super-galactic), given the peculiar internal arrangements of the quadrupole and octopole. Thus, it is not the ecliptic correlation per se that is anomalous, but rather the quadrupole-octopole alignment. Whether this latter feature is caused by cosmological or non-cosmological physics is not yet clear, but solar-system physics does not appear to provide the most plausible explanation. ---Cheers"

The data shows evidence for systematic differences between the Northern and Southern regions of the sky. Masking out the galactic plane does not eliminate signals of anisotropy seen in the full sky studies. As consistency checks, the anisotropies of CMB plus simulated synchrotron emission contamination from the plane of the galaxy are detected by our methods in just the spatial regions where they are simulated. The observed anisotropies cannot readily be explained away by appealing to galactic foreground contamination. --Testing Isotropy of Cosmic Microwave Background RadiationAuthors: Samal, Pramoda Kumar; Saha, Rajib; Jain, Pankaj; Ralston, John P.MNRAS, 385, 1718-1728 (2008)and--Recent analyses of the WMAP data seem to indicate the possible presence of large-angle anisotropy in the Universe. If confirmed, these can have important consequences for our understanding of the Universe. A number of attempts have recently been made to establish the reality and nature of such anisotropies in the CMB data. Among these is a directional indicator recently proposed by the authors. A distinctive feature of this indicator is that it can be used to generate a sky map of the large-scale anisotropies of the CMB maps. Applying this indicator to full-sky temperature maps we found a statistically significant preferred direction. The full-sky maps used in these analyses are known to have residual foreground contamination as well as complicated noise properties. Thus, here we performed the same analysis for a map where regions with high foreground contamination were removed. We find that the main feature of the full-sky analysis, namely the presence of a significant axis of asymmetry, is robust with respect to this masking procedure. Other subtler anomalies of the full-sky are on the other hand no longer present. --So far I have seen few data that suggests that the data show that the earth is at the 'center' of the universe.

Even more remarkable is how the ocean would provide for important sources of protein (fish etc) and enable trade with other tribes.What a the chances that life would thrive at exactly these places...

In fact, while the porridge, bed and chair of the child bear was exactly the right size for the teenager who intruded, other 'guests' would have found the father or mother bear's porridge etc much more to their likings.In other words, we observers are biased to be in locations in which our existence is not just possible but also likely given the environment.Some may call this an enigma others just observe the logic behind such a correlation. Simple really and so if the anti-copernicans are interested in presenting their thesis and predictions, then fine.

1,"quite well, I am sure.You referred to a page which was authored by yourself, which interprets the statements by Carter made in his presentation.I found the original source to be far more useful"
1,"--IslandContrary to modern and ""variant interpretations"" the Anthropic Principle was originally formalized by Carter as an ideological statement against the dogmatic non-scientific prejudices that scientists commonly harbor, that cause them to consciously deny anthropic relevance in the physics, so they instead tend to be willfully ignorant of just enough pertinent facts to maintain an irrational cosmological bias that leads to absurd, ""Copernican-like"" projections of mediocrity that contradict what is actually observed. --Let's see what we can track down via Wikipedia which is always a good start for any research--WikipediaThe phrase ""anthropic principle"" was coined by the theoretical astrophysicist Brandon Carter, in his contribution to a 1973 Kraków symposium honouring Copernicus's 500th birthday. Carter articulated the Anthropic Principle as a reaction to overuse of the Copernican Principle, which states that we are not at a special position in the Universe. As Carter says, ""Although our situation is not necessarily central, it is inevitably privileged to some extent""The paper references isCarter, B. (1974). ""Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology"". IAU Symposium 63: Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data: 291-298, Dordrecht: Reidel.So the following part of Island's claim is correct""the Anthropic Principle was originally formalized by Carter ""--CarterCopernicus taught us the very sound lesson that we must not assume gratuitously that we occupy a privileged central position in the Universe. Unfortunately there has been a strong (not always subconscious) tendency to extend this to a most questionable dogma to the effect that our situation cannot be privileged in any sense. This dogma (which in its most extreme form led to the 'perfect cosmological principle' on which the steady state theory was based) is clearly untenable, as was pointed out by Dicke (Nature 192, 440, 1961), if one accepts (a) that specially favourable conditions (of temperature, chemical environment, etc.) are prerequisite for our existence, and (b) that the Universe evolves and is by no means spatially homogeneous on a local scale. --How to translate this or map this to Island's claim is more difficult. Carter points out some interesting points that the Copernican position can be taken too far, which leads to a dogmatic thinking. Rather I will approach the topic by quoting Carter--CarterMy own interest in this matter arose from reading Bondi's (1959) book Cosmology in which certain widely known 'large number coincidences' are listed as evidence justifying the introduction of various exotic theories (e.g. involving departures from normally accepted physical conservation laws) of which early examples were the 'varying G' theories of Dirac and Jordan. I am now convinced of the opposite thesis: i.e. that far from being evidence in favour of exotic theories these coincidences should rather be considered as confirming 'conventional' (General Relativistic Big Bang)  physics and cosmology which could in principle have been used to predict them all in advance of their observation. However these predictions do require the use of what may be termed the anthropic principle to the effect that what we can expect to observe must be restricted by the conditions necessary for our presence as observers. (Although our situation is not necessarily central, it is inevitably privileged to some extent.)---So on one hand Carter does warn against dogmatically applying the Copernican principle, I am not sure that the full description of Island can be found in this paper.  The anthropic statement for instance was in response to Bondi's book in which he introduced several coincidences which would required additional, exotic theories to be proposed, including departures from conservation laws. Contrary to this Carter argues that these coincidences are well in line with common scientific understanding once we accept the  anthropic principle"
1,Carter points out that the coincidence found by Bondi belonged to three classes(1) the traditional kind - without use of the anthropic principle; (2) those which only require the use of a 'weak' anthropic principle; and (3) those which require the invocation of an extended (and hence rather more questionable) 'strong' anthropic principle. The Weak Anthropic Principle is described as--This prediction provides a good illustration of the use of the 'weak' anthropic principle to the effect that we must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is necessarily privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers.-The Strong Anthropic Principle is described as--Condition (8) is a good example of a prediction based on what may be termed the 'strong' anthropic principle stating that the Universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage.--

1,"Remember this is about Island's claim and Carter's arguments. I will leave it to the interested reader as to whether or not Island's description was correct. That Island reads into Carter's points as a 'cure for the disease' it was to avoid exactly the special pleadings to new models and rely on the existing models to explain what Carter described as the anthropic principle. It does help to read the actual paper, which is btw available to anyone interested.You seem to call this a 'prejudice' but that is understandable since you seem to rely on a yet to be defined 'hypothetical model' which you believe explains the observations better, although lacking the details such a claim has to be dismissed as lacking in specifics.The reason to formulate the 'anthropic principles' was well described by Carter--... that far from being evidence in favour of exotic theories these coincidences should rather be considered as confirming 'conventional' (General Relativistic Big Bang) physics and cosmology which could in principle have been used to predict them all in advance of their observation.--As long as one uses the anthropic principles which I described in more detail.Others have come to the similar, reasonable conclusion--The modern era of anthropic reasoning dawned quite recently, with a series of papers by Brandon Carter, another cosmologist. Carter coined the term “anthropic principle” in 1974, clearly intending it to convey some useful guidance about how to reason under observation selection effects. We shall later look at some examples of how he applied his methodological ideas to both physics and biology. While Carter himself evidently knew how to apply his principle to get interesting results, he unfortunately did not manage to explain it well enough to enable all his followers to do the same.--Source:  Nick Bostrom    http://www.anthropic-principle.com/primer.html    "

1,"You mean ones like 'WMAP shows that we are at the center of the universe' or the quote of Carter?Well, I realize that one does remain ""The Goldilocks Enigma is a falsifiable observation that makes testable predictions:""As I already explained though observations are seldomly falsified as they are based on observed data. What science does is, given these observations, to propose a hypothesis to explain the coincidence. You claim that you have provided a 'falsifiable prediction' but so far the prediction at best is ad hoc, not surprisingly perhaps because there appears to be a lacking 'hypothesis' to support your 'prediction'.--IslandI gave supported examples for how the predictive capabilities of the Goldilocks Enigma lie in the balance between diametrically opposing runaway tendencies .--A meaningless statement really. You referred to the work by Ryals (aka island) who made some pretty ad hoc claims. But perhaps, I may not fully understand your position which seems to be based mostly on perusing some literature which you believe shows non-copernican tendencies and then claim 'see...'. What I see is how science is exploring a large variety of plausible explanations for the observations and is not jumping to conclusions without a good supporting base of hypotheses and data. Which is why most suggest that we basically do not know how to explain the correlations and alignment of the data in WMAP, especially now that science has found how these are lacking in other data from MASS2. In fact, the author suggests that the tools to detect these anomalies may be lacking. In other words, --A better approach to the search for non-Gaussianity in the CMB data may be through more theoretically motivated searches. With blind searches we fall into the trap that one can always ﬁnd a non-Gaussian signal in a map, even if it is consistent with Gaussianity. Thus general non-Gaussian detections can easily be dismissed. However, blind searches have the advantage of scope, and can detect the signatures of new physics. In either case, we can still improve on ourcurrent investigations. The wealth of statistics employed in the literature are not independent, but the degeneracies and correlations are not clear.--That by itself should be sufficient a warning to not conclude that the WMAP data _shows_ that we are at the center of the universe. At best one may argue that it is consistent with such, although even that one lacks in sufficient theoretical evidence. In other words, what is missing is showing that this is exactly a prediction or outcome of the model which Island prefers. Although he has hinted at the Einstein model, it is far from clear that this is the one he has in mind as specifics seem to be largely lacking.In order to do some real science, I suggest that Island presents his preferred model, without which it is impossible to evaluate his claims, and then shows that the model indeed predicts or explains the observed correlations and alignments.That's what science would do."
1,"--Having been asked to contribute a discussion of the anthropic principle for a colloquium on cosmology, I would start by recalling that although its original formulation [1] was motivated by a problem of cosmology (Dirac’s) and although many of its most interesting subsequent applications (such as the recent evaluation [2] of the dark energy density in the universe) have also been concerned with large scale global effects, the principle for which I introduced the term “anthropic” is not intrinsically cosmological, but just as relevant on small local scales as at a global level. --its original formulation was motivated by a problem of cosmology...--CarterThis presentation will not attempt to deal with the confusion that has arisen from such dissident interpretations, but will be concerned only with developments of my originally intended meaning, which I shall attempt to explain in the next section. --then--Although frequently relevant to purely local applications, the anthropic principle was originally formulated in a cosmological context as a reasonable compromise two successively fashionable extremes. The ﬁrst of these was what might be described as the autocentric principle, which underlay the pre Copernican dogma to the effect that as terrestrial observers we occupy a privileged position at the center of the universe. The opposite extreme was the more recent precept describable as the cosmological ubiquity principle, but commonly referred to just as the cosmological principle, which would haveit that the Universe is much the same everywhere, having no priviledged center, and that our own neighbourhood can be considered as a typical random sample. --"
1,"In my discussions with Island I have come to the conclusion that I was mistaken in calling Island an ID supporter. However, I also have come to the conclusion that Island's speculations are based largely on a vague concept which lacks a sufficient theoretical foundation allowing one to make predictions. It's more like a calicos cat, many patches that make up the story without a clear common connection, other than that they, in some form or manner, argue against Copernican mediocrity principle. Island's entropic anthropic principle seems to fall into that category of not enough to pass judgement and not enough to make predictions.I'd encourage Island to present his claims in a more accessible and foundational format that would allow one to evaluate his claims beyond the piece meal approach chosen.And of course, if this can evolve fewer namecalling, then we may actually have a discussion on the merits of Islands claims"

Here again, it seems that you have failed to provide other examples of worlds where complex observers like us also have the best conditions for observing.  And I have failed to produce counter-examples.  So what?  As usual, an ""example of one"" might, in fact, be just good fortune.  But your ""argument"" is not scientific, it's just your personal opinion.""the most life-friendly region of the galaxy is also the best place to be an astronomer""I am not familiar with any other ""life-friendly"" region of the galaxy where it might or might not be a better place to be an astronomer.  Are you?""Probably none of these pieces of evidence in isolation can force the committed skeptic to admit design; but, taken together, I think they are strong evidence of intelligent design for anyone open to the possibility.""Perhaps that would be someone who has a religious motivation to accept such a ""possibility""?

2,"You gave 3 claims of Intelligent Design:1) Intelligent agents sometimes leave traces of their activity behind, like fingerprints on evidence.      -  No one can argue with that.  -2) There are signs of design in nature—in the stuff biologists and physicists and astronomers study.       -  Many naturalists argue with this, but the signs of design are pretty obvious.  -Other favorite/important quotes/points:1) Design theorists are like forensic detectives.  They operate on the same principles and look for the same kinds of evidence.  So ID science should be possible.2) Notice that the focus of design arguments is on the effects themselves, not on the designer.      -  Good point!  Critics however, don't care about the truth. They just want to disqualify ID from the science arena so they try and distract people from this truth.  It is the argument, not the personal philosophy or belief of the scientist, that should be what is important.  -3) The evidence for design is the same either way - whether the designer is supernatural or human. No one would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by saying: “That ain’t no ordinary mountain. Somebody designed it.”    -  Pointing out design in nature does not make ID unconstitutional!  Good point.  -4) To summarize: you can often tell that something is designed even if you don’t know anything else about the designer, and regardless of the identity and metaphysical status of the designer. If you understand this, you’ve already understood more than 95% of the smartest ID critics and more than virtually every reporter who has ever written about ID.    -  I just wish the critics would honestly deal with ID instead of setting up straw men and attacking it.  From my stand point, they lose credibility when they do this, and I would think that would be true of most people.  I think they are shooting themselves in the foot when they do this.  I'm sure they fool some people, but most people aren't that dumb.  I'm always amazed at how dumb they think the average joe is.  -5) ID can be properly considered in public scientific discussions and be distinguished from arguments for God’s existence, while nevertheless have positive theological implications.     -  Critics will not grant you this point, but it is hard to argue against it.  Thanks for the good article.  There is no reason to be afraid of where the evidence leads, unless of course, you are a die-hard naturalist who doesn't like the idea that a ""Designer"" may really exist.  -No wonder materialists don’t like ID.    -  This is the bottom line isn't it?  -"
1,"also Christians concerned about science.But to correct your confusion, and I do not blame you for being unfamiliar with the premises of ID, ID is not in anyway close to forensic detectives.They deal in real issues such as means, motives, opportunities, and identify suspects. ID is at best claiming that 'x' should be seen as evidence of design because we do not fully comprehend it.Why is it so hard for ID proponents to address these simple facts."
2,"To correct PvM's confusion:Forensic detectives have to figure out the means. Motives and opportunities also come AFTER the design inference has been made.That is what I have been telling you for days- That it matters a great deal to any investigation whether or not that which is being investigated arose via agency involvement or nature, operating freely.There wouldn't be a motive for a natural death. And in a homicide motive alone is pretty meaningless.And again the design inference is based on our current knowledge- that being we have an understanding of what nature, operating freely, is capable of and we couple that with our knowledge of what designing agencies are capable of.Why is it so hard for ID opponents to understand this simple fact?"

1,"The only way that design could be detected in nature is if there were objects around that weren't designed. Otherwise,there wouldn't be any way of telling the difference. But Christianity and other theistic religions maintain that God created heaven and earth, in other words, everything. It follows that absolutely everything was designed and there is no way of singling out living things as more designed than anything else.Bzzzt! Thanks for playing. "
1,"and one of the reasons why ID appears to be lousy theology but what the heck  I am sure IDers can find yet another ad hoc explanation for this.They are quite good at the apologetics part of this, it's the science part that they still need to iron out."
2,"Yes Jim, we see objects on a daily basis that were not designed. Otherwise the word ""artifact"" wouldn't have any meaning.Also there wouldn't be any need for a special department for homicide- you do realize that we can tell the difference between a homicide, an accident and a natural death.BTW Christianity does not maintain that ""God"" Created everything AS IT IS TODAY."
1,"I'm aware of that ID Christians give themselves a huge fudge factor by claiming that the Fall of Man somehow fouled up non-human nature. But there were, we presume, rocks and sand and and mud in the Garden of Eden. If somebody examined them on the morning before the Fall, would they also show signs of design? After all, they would be God's creation and therefore artifacts.So, Bzzzt! Thanks for playing again. We do appreciate the quarters you keep dropping in the machine. "
1,"--Joe GBTW Christianity does not maintain that ""God"" Created everything AS IT IS TODAY.--Some versions of Christianity in fact do seem to do this as they allow only for minor variation. However, this is an important comment since it shows that the concept of 'front loading' which removes the design event to outside our direct observation, is fully compatible with science as we know it and thus the addition of the need of a 'designer' seems rather ad hoc and perhaps unnecessary. ID however proposes no way to resolve this conundrum, which is why, in the minds of so many, ID is scientifically vacuous."
2,"That figures.Geez PvM your position that everything comes down to sheer dumb luck is totally vacuous. It cannot be tested. It relies solely on circumstantial evidence which is guided by your predisposition to reject design a priori.BTW everything in your position is beyond observation.

1,"Intelligent Design is an idea, not a theory. The evidence given amounts to this: 1) Life is complex. 2) We don't have complete models of how nature could have done it.But here is where the error comes in. The ASSUMPTION that just because we don't know, something unnatural created us. You will hear people say 'there is evidence of design'. This is a very broad statement. Ask questions! What kind of evidence? Is this the conclusion of a scientific peer-reviewed study? Or is it something that ""seems"" right to the person making the statement? To make a judgement one way or the other, you must educate yourself on terms, and what people mean by certain words.Yet another contradiction is this: If nature could not have created us, and some intelligence did, what created that intelligence? Some other intelligence? What created that? Unnatural, natural, hmmm. The whole thing starts to smell real funny when you look at it from the side.I understand that ID claims to not focus on the designer. Rather the evidence for design. The nature of the design is inextricably related to the nature of the designer however. But as related to being taught in schools, what is there to teach? Besides a sentence saying ""evolution currently is not fully understood"", I can't think of anything relevant that ID could provide.It is an interesting talking point, in looking at what evolution can not currently explain. But don't make the mistake that science will continue to be ignorant of such phenomena. Despite what many think, science is just a passive tool used for understanding the world around us. The word comes from the latin word for knowledge, after all.Just remember: We Don't Know. Yet."
2,"It is a fact that design can be determined in the absence of a designer.As a matter of fact reality dictates that the ONLY way to make ANY deyermination about the designer(s) or the specific process(es) used, IN THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT OBSERVATION OR DESIGNER INPUT, isto study the design in question.If we knew the designer then we wouldn't have a design inference as design would be a given. And then we certain;y wouldn't need science to aid us in that design inference.BTW you people continue to ignore the fact that natural processes cannot account for the origins of nature because natural processes only exist IN nature."
1,"The pro-IDers claim that ""ID Uses Scientific Method; Infers Design by Testing Positive PredictionsDiscovery Institute on ID Uses Scien. Method; Infers Design by Testing Positive Predictions""However this is false and misleading. First of all it is important to point out that by design, ID means the ""set theoretic complement of the disjunction regularity or chance"". Now what does this mean? This means that when science fails to have found an explanation for any particular system, ID argues that the default should not be ""we don't know"" but rather ""design"". In other words, design is a place holder for our ignorance. Now ask yourself, does ID provide any positive explanations? Of course it does not. How otherwise does ID explain the bacterial flagellum? It provides no testable hypotheses beyond the negative claim that ""science cannot explain it"".Notice that ID remains scientifically vacuous, that is without merit, because it is unable to constrain its designer(s) which means that as an explanation it cannot even compete with the ""we don't know"" category.In other words, ID uses misleading terminology as well as bait and switch to make its claims. Ask yourself for instance: how does ID define 'information' and how to does it actually use this terminology? Information is the negative base two logarithm of the probability that a particular system can be explained by science. In other words, complexity or information, two terms which are used interchangeably by ID disappears when one can explain the system. But that also means that no complexity remains if ID were to be able to explain the system.Realize that ID has failed to be scientifically relevant in any non trivial manner and you will come to realize why it has remained and is in fact doomed to remain, scientifically vacuous."
1,"--BTW you people continue to ignore the fact that natural processes cannot account for the origins of nature because natural processes only exist IN nature.--Are you saying that natural processes can account for the evolution of nature because only natural processes exist in nature?--Joe GIt is a fact that design can be determined in the absence of a designer.--Sure, by understanding the constraints of the designer, the general motives, opportunities and means and other circumstantial evidence. This is called ordinary design.ID is about rarefied design which refuses to contrain the designer and thus lack a reliable method to infer design.I assume you have yet to read Wilkins and Elsberry's paper on this?That's a shame because it would lift a piece of the veil of ignorance we see so typically covering ID proponents' knowledge about science, whether it is the fact of common descent, a fact which even Behe accepts, or the scientific vacuity of design."
1,"Jay,What makes you qualify as a design theorist?  Please be specific.-Karen"
1,"Why are you claiming one designer? There's just as much evidence for a pantheon as there is a monotheistic god, but you have the prior assumption the designer is your god and automatically rule them out when you say ""the"" designer.You also don't bear into account other possibilities: the designer left, the designer actually meant for some other creature to rise into power (plausible, since we live on a planet 75% water and yet do not have gills,) or the designer is not omnipotent or omniscient and cannot travel back in time. These are not disprovable by the rules you've laid out as your ""proof"" for ID.You are not claiming ""intelligent design"" as much as you are ""one being outside the rules of physics who is capable of time travel and travel throughout the universe, who for some unknown reason remains invested in one planet of the creation he/she/it made.""

ID is not a theory and it can never be science and therefore it is properly rejected in scientific discussions.Just what is the ""ID theory""?

1,"For years now the Intelligent Design proponents and the Discovery Institute have been working the 'catholic angle', getting some of its cardinals into trouble. Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna Christoph Schönborn was the first noticable victim of the bait and switch and it took a while before the Catholic church could restore order and continue in its position that good theology requires good science and that ID creationism provides neither.Although I am not a fan of some of the Catholic Church's position, I am encouraged by its ability to shake of its past dealings with Intelligent Design.

Appearance of design does beg a real scientific question, however science has so far shown how honest scientists resolve this issue. After all, we know that us humans are very easily deceived in seeing design where there is none. This is very likely an evolutionary adaptation.As to ID, what do they do to resolve the issue of appearance of design? Nothing really because they refuse to go beyond the design inference approach. Ask yourself, what have ID proponents done in this area?Pray tell."
2,"In the 19th Century fundamentalist supported the idea that new species appear abruptly, Catastrophism. Then Charles Darwin came along with his theory of Natural Selection and ""proved"" that new species evolve gradually. But it wasn't true. The fossil record shows no change for a long periods of time, then abruptly new species appeared. In 1972 scientist began calling this Punctuated Equilibrium. But Punctuated Equilibrium was nothing but a 20th Century version of Catastrophism. The fundamentalist had been right and Darwin had been wrong!"
1,"Like all theories Evolution has changed over the years because of new evidence was discovered.  The most current theory (modern synthesis) does not support long periods of no change then the sudden appearance of species, rather it describes long periods of slow change punctuated by occasion bursts revolving around sudden environmental shifts.Which is what   science   is about... changing theories when presented with new information that either reveals observations that the theory does not cover or is contradictory to that theory.  Contrast that to   religion   which, when presented with evidence contrary or outside of its beliefs, acts to suppress or ignore that evidence."
2,You are ignoring my main point that Catastrophism was closer to the truth then Darwin. Are fundamentalist stubborn? Yes! Are scientist any less stubborn? No! The history of   science   is full of examples of scientists ignoring evidence contrary to established theory. The point is that in this case the fundamentalist were right and the scientists were wrong.
1,"How was Catastrophism closer then the original Darwinian theory?  Catastrophism offered no mechanism for the changes that we see, was completely wrong as to what catastrophes occurred,  how severe they were, and when they took place.Darwin's original theory, as put forth in ""Origin of Species"", has long since been supplanted by modern theories of Evolution... it was wrong with regards to many things, but Catastrophism was wrong to a greater extent then Evolution ever was.It should also be noted that once the evidence had accumulated showing that earlier theories had been wrong the Scientists changed their theories and agreed that the new interpretation was correct... when have the fundamentalists ever done so?

""This is very likely an evolutionary adaptation""... no matter how long it takes to prove it.--Where did we see God standing over the victim? The reason science does not give equal time to ID is because it presents nothing scientifically relevant, it's really that simple. Call it 'reactionary' or 'old fashioned' that scientists insists on something scientifically relevant. Remember, design always remains a possibility, even when science manages to explain the supposedly 'designed' features, such is the nature of theology versus science.

Throw a sine curve at world history. The results are direct, and show a degree of correlation we cannot ascribe to chance.---In fact, Darwinists are looking for non-random patterns and have found it, which is why evolutionary theory and the evidence are so exciting where the evolutionary drivers included such concepts as variation, inheritance and selection. Of course, we cannot ascribe it to chance, which is exactly what evolutionary theory suggests.And yet the proponent of Eonic effect suggests that a 'new understanding' is needed.

Landon ""nemonemini""""The work described in this book has led me to the conclusion that natural selection must work not just on each individual mutation, but also on the very mechanisms that generate genetic variation-as it does on all bio- logical functions. The research discussed in this book leads to the conclusion that mutations are not all accidents and that mutations are not always random. Our genomes, and those of other life forms, have evolved mechanisms that create different kinds of mutations in their DNA, and they reuse and adapt useful pieces of DNA, even to the point that there are genomic 'interchangeable parts.'Biochemical mechanisms can arise that tend to focus genetic variation, resulting in ""hot spots"" of genetic change at certain places in the genome.""---In a review of ""Darwin In the Genome: Molecular Strategies in Biological Evolution"" by Lynn CaporaleIndeed, to understand what science means by 'random' when it applies to evolutionary theory, one has to do more than claim that random must mean without pattern. Such a confusion, which could have laid to rest quickly, can cause one to hold to a flawed assumption that evolution is 'random', when all evolutionary theory (not necessarily Darwinism) observes that the source of variation is 'random' with respect to its immediate effects given an environment.Of course, that evolutionary processes themselves can improve mechanisms of variations, or that variation comes in hot spots, is nothing new, let alone at odds with how science uses the term 'random' when it comes to evolution."
1,"The response by the Discovery Institute says that the ""methodology for detecting design (which I discuss in my first opening statement) is entirely empirical and scientific."" and ""As William Dembski explains: ""Intelligent design is the science that studies signs of intelligence."" Unfortunately, a review of the entire corpus of actual scientific journal articles reveals an inconvenient truth:  The so-called empirical scientific truths of intelligent design creationism seem to be entirely missing.  A disinterested observor searching for signs of intelligence in the search for signs of intelligence would find statements such as this 2003 quote from Philip Johnson, one of the originators of the intelligent design movement, on a Christian radio talk show: ""Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit, so that we can get the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools."" And here's a 1996 quote from Philip Johnson: ""This (intelligent design) isn't really, and never has been, a debate about science. It's about religion."" This is as good as it gets, straight from their prophet's mouth. And as Judge Jones ruled in 2005, ""We have concluded that intelligent design is not science, and moreover that intelligent design cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents.""  Judge Jones also stated: ""It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the intelligent design policy.""Intelligent design creationism may have religious merit, but it certainly has utterly no scientific merit.

1,"To sneer at AynRandInstitute and Ayn Rand's philosophy is to fail to address the growing primary reason why people are deciding ""God"" is not an explanation of anything.I won't flesh out the arguments from philosophy here.  But, if you care to know why ""God"" is not included in the growing philosophy of the present and the future, I point you to Rand and Leonard Peikoff for the details.The view that there is nothing in existence that can give meaning to the anti-concept ""supernatural"" comes from several points in Objectivism.The Primacy of Existence places all consciousness in a dependent position on reality, cannot be the creator of it.The full acceptance of existence, as the place where you live and as the concept which names the nature of the place where you live renders invalid the notion that there is any alternative to it.The law of identity makes notions like design, created order, creation, miracles, creation by speech (the Word) all meaningless.  There's literally nothing which gives meaning to those notions, once you grasp that everything has an identity and behaves according to its nature.Reason is the capacity for knowledge and the barrier past which any claims of supernatural revelation cannot pass.  To claim that God told you somethng which reason cannot identify or validate means that you think you somehow received knowledge which your mind is not capable of getting.Reason again is the instrument of proof and insists that, before an honest man will ""believe"" any idea, he will view and understand the proof for that idea.  And, proof means showing how the idea is a logical conclusion drawn from evidence coming from the world in which we live.  In all of world history and among the best thinkers of mankind, no proof of the existence of God or any other supernatural entity has been provided.So, from the simple basis of the nature of reality and the inescapable nature of human knowledge-gaining (cognition), God simply fails to put in an appearance.  There is no evidence to support such a supposed being.Whether you are a (groundless) believer or a person of sincerity, devoted to reality and reason, you need to know where this conclusion about ""God"" comes from.  So, you owe it to yourself to take up the study of Rand's Objectivism to find out.  Because, it is the foundation for all persuasive thinking in the next century and forever after that."
2,"You're lucky not enough people know or care enough about your religion to throw out opinions based on it presented as science, philosophy, logic, or fact on the spot.  Claims that the world was created in exactly 6 days exactly as the Bible says it was have just as much credence as your religious argument.  NONE!  There is nothing persuasive about Objectivism, especially when it's disciples cite it as fact without any evidence other than, ""Well Ayn Rand said so.""  Come back to me with arguments not based on Objectivism, and we'll talk.  The sad part is, Ayn Rand seems like she was a very rational and logical person.  It is a shame that her modern disciples have so perverted that image."
1,"Hello Richard,I admire your wealth in cash funds.  That being the kinder way to explain you chasing my comments all over the Internet in order to add hateful and irrational comments about whatever I've written.Your statements about Objectivism are without any meaning of any kind until you define the word ""religion"" which you apply to a philosophy of reason, not faith, of this world, not supernaturalism, of morality, not the sacrifice of a deity in order to save sinful mankind, of disbelief in God, not abject theism.  If you want anyone, including yourself, to know what you are talking about, define your key terms.Oh, and while you are at it, consult a reliable text on logic, on reasoning fallacies, on epistemology...because, if you think that Ayn Rand's Objectivism does not rest on proof, you have a gap in your knowledge of what constitutes proof and how one goes about establishing it.Don't be so angry and hasty, Robert.  You are not a sinner, don't behave like one."

What I am arguing is that a plausibility is not sufficient for it to be scientifically with merit. In fact, ID has shown nothing to go beyond its eliminative and thus highly unreliable approach to detect rarefied design.Perhaps you can show us how ID has contributed in this area to make the question a scientifically tractable one?"

What is/was the Designer like? Did the Designer give specific instructions to his creations, as most religions teach? The ID promoters delibrately leave such questions unanswered in their official pronouncements about ID. Why?That's assuming that the objection above is to be taken at face value. I do not and think the Discovery Institute is just bull$#itting us. They avoid the questions about the Designer because of the church/state separation issue. That's just a cop-out. Science does not end with an inference of design, ever. If it did, Darwin himself would have not bothered to come up with his natural selection theory. You either go on to determine the nature of the Designer or you conclude that your preception of design was flawed because you cannot do the former.Intelligent Design is not only scientifically meaningless, it is theologically worthless as well. If I were still a Christian, I'd scorn those hypocrites at the Discovery Institute just as much as I do now as an agnostic."

2,"First, ID is being applied only to objects that have high levels of CSI.  Since there is no data concerning the amount of CSI the designer has, then ID is not currently applicable to the designer.  Perhaps the designer must have a designer, and perhaps not.  Science cannot make this determination at this time.Second, whenever scientists hypothesize that A causes B, they will inevitably have to search for the cause of A.  Should this stop them from hypothesizing A as a cause of B?  Science, like   evolution  , occurs one step at a time.  After we test ID, if we find that it leads to successful predictions and never (or hardly ever) leads to failed predictions, then and only then should we worry about the cause of the designer.  Reasoning otherwise puts an end to scientific inquiry.  The Ayn Rand Institute is anti-science."
2,"""According to its advocates, the ""designer"" responsible for ""intelligent design"" in biology could be any sort of ""creative intelligence"" capable of engineering the basic elements of life. Some have even seriously nominated advanced space aliens for the role.""Now let's see, 100 billion galaxies ... but nah, mankind is the only intelligent being in existence. ""[a] premise seems to be that as long as [we] don't explicitly name the ""designer""--as long as [we] allow that the ""designer"" could be a naturally existing being, a being accessible to scientific study--that this somehow saves [a] viewpoint from the charge of being inherently religious in character.""Absolutely.  There are two basic reasons to postulate anything.  (1) A desire for it to be true (agenda), or (2) it fits the evidence (objectivism).  Regarding a designer or creator, there is a third motivation for another position.  (3) A desire for total independence, and/or the belief that one has logic that eclipses traditional beliefs.  Atheism is more of a position of arrogance than one of objectivism.ID postulates on evidence, not a religious position.  Arguing that it is a tactic or a guise, simply because it may be in some cases, fails objectivism.  It is more of a deterministic stance, i.e. arrogance. ""One does not explain complexity by dreaming up a new complexity as its cause.""Sorry to go against William Occam's easily falsifiable viewpoint, but complexity is the more the norm than the exception.  And not by happenstance, but by design."
1,"--complexity is the more the norm than the exception. And not by happenstance, but by design.--Sure, we know what mechanism can cause the apparent design of complexity. --Now let's see, 100 billion galaxies ... but nah, mankind is the only intelligent being in existence. --That we know of. It's called selection bias.ID speculates on lack of evidence to suggest that our ignorance is best explained by something called design. Let's not confuse the matter by claiming that ID postulates anything relevant to science."
2,"I guess I must be old fashioned - but I do believe in real science. And I do recall that scientific experiments have never given evidence to suggest that spontaneous generation occurs. That being true, why in the world do so many in the scientific community hold so tightly to the notion that somehow, out of the ""primordial ooze"", given just the right mixture of mud, slime and chemicals, a living single cell organism just sort of ""poofed"" into existence, complete with DNA, and able to reproduce. And then, that single organism just kept on changing into a new species every so often, which ""evolved"" over time into all of the plants and animal that we see on the earth today. Now, that is a monstrous stretch of the imagination, not to mention totally non-scientific, and at best, pure speculation and more likely pure nonsense. There is no evidence to support this idea. So why is this theory of spontaneous generation at the very core of modern science today?  Years ago, without the tools of DNA analysis, and to appease those who funded certain ""scientific experiments and writing"", I can see how the evolution theory was ginned up, with the backing of some physical science and observation. It was a story easy to understand, and with the education of the day, it appeared believable. People said, ""Aaaaah. Now I can sleep at night, knowing how I got here.""I understand that without some kind of creation theory, there is a huge ""void"" in understanding our existence: How did we get here? Where did we come from? What about the dinosaurs? However, I was taught via science at a young age that ""just because you don't understand something or have evidence to prove it, you are not justified in making up a story to fill in the gaps, and then selling the idea as fact"".Very recent, extensive, highly sophisticated genetic studies have generated very compelling evidence to suggest that one species does not ""evolve"" or ""give rise"", over time to a separate species. While I believe that through ""natural selection"" and ""survival of the fittest"" a species in a given area may prosper or decline, and through that ""natural selection"" process, certain physical or other attributes become more common in a species in a given area, genetic evidence suggests that one species does not ""evolves"" into another species over time. The way I see it, Intelligent Design is just as viable a theory as spontaneous generation. In fact, even more believable. Why? Because:1.) I am 100% certain that I am really here. I can prove it. I am proof that a living human species really does exist. There is real, hard evidence. And there is solid evidence that a huge variety of different kinds of living things exist today on this earth and have existed in the past.2.) The Human species has a huge variability in physical and other attributes, but genetically we are all one species. We are not genetically linked to any other species on the planet.3.) Since spontaneous generation does not work, how do you account for the fact that there is life on this earth? It had to have happened some way. There is an explanation.4.) And since one species does not give rise to another different species, just how would you account for the incredible variety of living species on this earth today? There has to be some explanation.4.) The notion of Intelligent Design, with all of the possibilities that goes along with it (including the notion that perhaps that entity is possibly the same species as I am) seems very plausible to me, and not nearly as flakey as clinging to a non-scientific notion of spontaneous generation, or that one species gives rise to another different species over time and thereby gave rise to all of the varieties of species on this planet today. C'mon now. Let’s actually be scientific about this! Intelligent Design has as much merit as the non-scientific evolution theory. Intelligent Design DOES NOT necessarily imply ""religion"". Where does that notion come from? It merely implies an intelligent life form ""could"" have had a hand (or paw, or branch) in populating this planet with the wide variety of living things we see today.So the way I see it, anyone with a sound scientific mind would consider it idiotic NOT to put forth Intelligent Design as a possibility."
2,"Intelligent Design has been misrepresented as some kackamamy religiously motivated scheme by those who are afraid to challenge what they believe in.  This misrepresentation is not true.  Intelligent design is a bold and controversial new theory based on careful examination of genetics, astronomy, and biology.  It is rapidly spreading through the scientific community, despite the bad name put forward by the Ayn Rand center and others.  This theory is not the eyeball example that everyone has heard.  ""The human eye is far too complex to have come into being by chance, mwah, mwah mwah, mwah mwah.""  No!  That is an opinion, not scientific fact.  Intelligent Design has demonstrated using genetics and statistics that the chances of even the simplest life randomly occuring are too small to be statistically valid.  That is a fact, not an opinion.  The logical conclusion, then, is that for life to exist, some kind of designer is required.  Committed Secularists, Objectivists, and other followers of violently atheistic religions are now terrified that, for the first time in a long time, science supports theism.  As a result of this terror, they are religiously attacking this threat."

1,"First off, the human Eye did not pop into existence by chance, it is the result of billions of years worth of   evolution  ... a process by which slight mutations (changes in the structure) proved advantageous and were passed down, leading to more complex structures.I'm not sure how ID has been demonstrated by genetics and statistics... however you are avoiding the big question that ID raises.   If life is to complex to exist without a designer, then that designer cannot be a living thing.  If the designer is not a living thing then what is it?  What was the designers intentions, where is the designer now?  What predictions does ID make regarding the future?"
2,"The whole point of bringing up the eye example is to demonstrate that ID is an actual theory, and not a simple example in which someone proclaims that something is too complex based on their own judgements.  ID doesn't use the eye example.  Scientists studying simple ribosomes forming in conditions similar to the beginning of the Earth have determined that the chances of those ribosomes forming into a cell by random chance are too small to be statistically signifigant.  It is then logical to posit that something as yet unexplained by science caused this to happen.  There is more, unfortunately, I am not a genetecist, so I can't accurately convey all the juicy details, but many genetecists have come out and said that a designer of some kind is required for genetics to exist.  We don't know what the designer is.  That's the whole point.  It is as yet not understood by science.  It's still a very new and basic theory.  Those questions are all opinion questions."

If you can achieve that, life springing forth from non-life,   evolution  , at least in theory, actually holds water, though there are other problems.

1,"--Casey writes--ID doesn't try to address theological questions about the identity, nature, or origin of the designer. The question ""Who Designed the Designer?"" is outside the scope of the scientific theory of ID, and is thus a philosophical or theological question that can only be addressed via philosophy or theology. ---This is inconsistent because ID argues that information and complexity requires a designer and thus if they invoke a Supernatural entity, they have to explain who or what created this complex form.Dawkins has done a great job at turning ID's 'argument' against itself. And again Casey continues to make the same flawed argument--In fact, we can detect design without any knowledge of the designer’s identity or origin. --We cannot detect design reliably when we lack any positive data to constrain the designer. It's that simple. And yet that is what ID is attempting to do. Just ask any IDer, how does ID explain the bacterial flagella and you will be amazed that they provide nothing. That's because 'design' as defined by ID is at best a position of ignorance.It's sad to see how ID keeps using 'bait and switch' between design as defined by ID and design as more commonly understood by the layperson.And finally this fallacious claim--CaseyThis point illustrates the fact that someone drawing larger philosophical implications from ID does not disqualify it from being scientific. In fact, many Darwinists have argued that neo-Darwinism has larger anti-religious philosophical implications, but that does not make neo-Darwinism unscientific.--Of course not, because Darwinism is a scientific theory that stands on its own evidence. However, ID fails not only to present a scientific hypothesis, but worse cannot stand on its own legs. The vacuity of ID at a scientific level is explained easily by ID's appeal to the supernatural.It's the religious motivations which caused ID to be developed, mostly as an outcome the Edwards ruling, to circumvent the law of the land. It's the religious motivation which has caused ID to remain scientifically vacuous. Needless to say, the quote mining of Casey deserves more scrutiny but I am taking his suggestion and will retire to my lovely bed. If ID has to resort to this kind of quote mining then the state of affairs are even worse than I thought."

And when pressed for details, the best they can come up with is that their faith guided them in developing scientific theories, theories which had no relevance to ID since it was based on methodological naturalism.It's this regrettable confusion which may give ID more relevance in people's minds than it really deserves. Wanting to 'read the mind of God' can be a useful metaphor to spur scientific research to the same extent as 'wanting to discover a theory of everything' to better understand nature. One should not confuse this with ID having a meaningfull manner to science.In fact, with Newton, one of the few ID explanations he provided, was shown to be quite wrong and it took until Laplace figured it out, to correct Newton's 'foolish' suggestion that since he could not understand how orbits of planets would remain stable, it would require God to actively correct these orbits. The concept of God is one of faith alone, once you have accepted the existence, it is hard to imagine a world without, but similarly, to those who have not found the need or for those who were not grown up in a religious environment, the need for a God or gods seems rather foolish. And neither side really has compelling scientific arguments as to why one position should be better than others.So let's not confuse these issues. ID is already confusing enough.PS: Since you used double quotes to describe Einstein's response, it would be helpful to correctly quote him. It was not ""I refuse to believe GOD would play chance with the Universe"" but rather""I, at any rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice."" (Einstein in a 1929 letter to Max Born). However, Einstein was hardly appealing to a God as guiding his quest for science.--Einstein clarified his religious views in a letter he wrote in response to those who claimed that he worshipped a Judeo-Christian god: ""It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal god and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.---Source: Wikipedia ""Einstein"""
1,"--CaseyEven the widely-touted theistic evolutionary biologist Kenneth Miller has claimed in five editions of his popular high school biology textbooks that the implication of evolution is that it works “without either plan or purpose” and is “random and undirected.”(15)--Casey should be well aware with the history --?A. I’m trying to set the context so I can give a full and complete answer to your question. So the interesting thing is that this is the only edition of any of the books that we have published, and probably eleven different editions, that contains that statement, and the reason for that quite simply is that I work with a co-author whose name is Joseph Levine, and Joe and I work together on many of the chapters in the book, but many of them we write separately and individually, and this was a statement as I was going through Joe’s chapters, and I feel very badly about that. When this was first pointed out to me, the third edition of this book was in print, I immediately went to Joe, I said Joe, I think this is a bad idea, I said I think this is a non-scientific statement, I think it will mislead students. Joe agreed. We immediately took it out of the book, and that’s why I emphasized that it did not appear in subsequent editions. So what you’re looking at, sir, is a mistake.(Transcript of Testimony of Kenneth Miller, Day 2 of Kitzmiller Trial (Sept. 27, 2005), pgs. 4-8.)--In the end the big difference is simple: ID has no scientific foundations, science does, in other words, there exists a valid secular purpose and the fact that some evolutionists are Christians and others are not is of no relevance.However, ID's history combined with its lack of content has doomed it."
1,"Pandasthumb also explored these 'accusations'    http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/kitzmillerrelat.html    Enjoy--We can learn a great deal about the nature of life by com- paring body systems among invertebrate groups and by tracing the patterns of change as we move from one phylum to an- other. As we do so, it is important to keep this concept in mind: Evolution is random and undirected. A common misconception is that evolution has proceeded from one group of organ- isms toward a goal of perfection. This is definitely not true. Organisms are not better or worse than one another – they are simply different. And the ways in which organisms carry out their essential life functions are neither more nor less perfect than one another – they are merely different methods of accomplishing the tasks necessary for survival.--Context matters as does complete reporting of the facts."
1,"""The question ""Who Designed the Designer?"" is outside the scope of the scientific theory of ID, and is thus a philosophical or theological question that can only be addressed via philosophy or theology.""So, to be very clear, ID posits that there is an entity which designs things. This entity is part of the 'scientific' explanation of ID. However, the nature and origin of this entity is ""philosophical or theological question"" outside the scope of science. By placing the very foundation of the explanation of ID, the designer, outside the bound of scientific investigation Mr. Luskin exposes the fact that he believes the designer must be super-natural. Mr. Luskin cant have it both ways, either the designer is part of a scientific explanation, and therefore amenable to scientific investigation, or the designer is scientifically off-limits, and therefore ID is non-scientific. Repeating myself for clarity. Alegedly the designer of life could be intelligent aliens, like say Mr. Spock. If the question of my own origin is a scientific question with a scientific answer, then the question of Mr. Spock's origin is a scientific question with a scientific answer. If the question of my designers origin is not scientific and does not have a scientific answer, then my designer cannot be Mr. Spock, and my designer must be a super natural entity.And a third time.All natural explanations can be framed within science explanations. An explanation that cannot be framed scientifically, must not be a natural explanation, and this is colloquially referred to as a super natural explanation.  Since the origin of the designer cannot be framed scientifically, the origin of the designer must have been a supernatural event, or the designer itself is supernatural. Q.E.D.Mr. Luskin, I think you owe the world an apology at some point. "
2,Debater Jay Richards answers this question quite clearly in a short video  at:     www.discovery.org/v/19    .  The folks at ARI should watch and listen.
1,"We may disagree as to the ability of ID proponents to explain the ultimate source of complexity. Since ID argues that complexity can only come from more complexity, the original source of the complexity found in our universe has to be caused by something even more complex, leading to the inevitable question of who designed this higher form of complexity.Claiming that ""it's turtles all the way down"" and that the original source of complexity has always existed is not a scientific claim."
1,"""Who designed the designer?"" is a valid and important point, and IDs fatal flaw.  Jay Richards argues that not knowing ""Who designed the designer?"" does not prove that there was no designer.  Just as design can be inferred from Mount Rushmore (his example) without knowing anything about who designed it or where they came from in turn, so the complexity of life demonstrates design even though we know nothing of the designer except that he/she/they/it exists.  Fine.  I agree that lack of knowledge concerning the designer does not prove he doesn't exist.  I only argue that by IDs OWN ARGUMENT (that complexity requires intelligent design), the complex intelligent designer itself MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN designed, leading to a near-infinite regression that Richards himself acknowledges.  Richards then argues that each person may have his own explanation concerning how the ""First Designer"", be it god, an advanced alien species, or matter itself (his example), came into existence.  But no matter how you explain the existence of a First Designer, the explanation must either hypothesize complex intelligence in the ABSENCE of a previous designer, or it must hypothesize a supernatural god that who doesn't have to obey ID's rules.  Assuming that you IDers are not hypothesizing god (which would make this a theological debate, and make ID creationism-in-sheep's-clothing), you must then be suggesting that the First Designer would have been complex enough to design the next designer in the chain without being designed itself.  Does your theory allow for the existence of a natural, but complex and intelligent being that was not itself designed?  If not, then we have an infinite regression.  If so, why not hypothesize that Man is that being, and that we just don't yet understand how its possible?  Sid"
2,"""By the very nature of its approach, ""intelligent design"" cannot be satisfied with a ""designer"" who is part of the natural world.""Define ""natural world"".  Prior to 1950 there were only 97 known elements. Several decades earlier, photons were unknown, or at least 'unproven'.  By the mid 1960's, physicists realized that their prior concept of matter being composed of the fundamental protons, neutrons, and electron, was insufficient to explain the myriad new particles being uncovered.  Prior to evidences, it was met with skepticism, and some of them were referred to as quacks; and thus came 'quarks'.ID addresses evidences for designed structures, mechanisms and synergistic systems in biology.  Hypothesizing intervening agencies is more difficult, and irrelevant to the ID synthesis.You at the institute state that the designer could not be natural.  I disagree, since everything that interacts with known matter (in this case bioforms), would likely exist within the universe, to enable it to interact.  It could well be external, if space is multidimensional, but it's not a requirement.  The basis for you claim is a fall back on the religious point of view for the master designer, but has no scientific evidence or merit on its own.  You conclusion, based on you meritless allegation of supernaturality or transcendency, is therefore pointless. Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne did a piece for the Guardian in which one of them, probably Dawkins, stated, "" ... any God capable of creating a bacterial flagellum (to say nothing of a universe) would have to be a far more complex, and therefore statistically improbable, entity than the bacterial flagellum (or universe) itself ... ""What kind of logic is that?  Is it improbable to be more complex than 45 proteins in one package?  Or even worse, to be more complex than the universe to create it?  What is the evidence for those assertions?Since an ant is more complex than a flagellum, I assume that one could put together a flagellum, even if God couldn't.""Its advertising to the contrary notwithstanding, ""intelligent design"" is inherently a quest for the supernatural.""  No, it's to define, and detect (or falsify) design in biosystems, and in so doing, possibly modify evolutionary theory.  While it's true that some advocate, and seek to validate, a young earth hypothesis, that is far from what ID hypothesizes.Ayn Rand rejected religion, and by extension theism, more for political reasons than logical inferences.  She believed in objectivism and rational thought.  So do I, but I also see the evidence of, and the logic for design.So who designed the designers?  I dunno, how do you assemble spirit energy?"
1,"==BowmanID addresses evidences for designed structures, mechanisms and synergistic systems in biology.==Where design basically means that science has yet to explain these exciting new observations. However, note that ID is by definition ill equipped to provide any explanation beyond 'poof'. Such is the fate of appealing to the supernatural which explains anything and thus really nothing."
2,Even the anti-IDists require something beyond nature to explain the origin of nature. Natural processes only exist in nature and therefor cannot account for its origins.ID is NOT an argument about complexity and it certainly does NOT state that complexity can only arise from complexity. ID is about FUNCTIONAL complexity. The bottom line is we do exist and there is only ONE reality behind our existence. If you listen to the anti-ID side our existence is due to many accidents- first cosmic and then genetic.Is that scientific? How can we test that premise? What predictions does it make?IOW it is very funny what PvM offers up as science and out of the other side of his mouth rejects ID without consideration.
1,"So ID is about complexity and function but that merely describes what I outlined already. Something has function and science does not understand how said function arose so we call it 'design'. Still an argument that adds nothing to 'we don't know' and in fact, as formulated is inherently unreliable.--JoeOW it is very funny what PvM offers up as science and out of the other side of his mouth rejects ID without consideration.--It's not only funny but contradicted by what I have said on this forum. And note that I am not addressing the claim of it being science, after all that would allow the ID proponent to sidetrack the discussion by pointing out the 'demarcation problem'. What I am arguing is far harder for ID to respond to namely the fact that it is scientifically speaking without content.What to see an example? How does ID explain the bacterial flagella? How does it compare to scientific hypotheses?Good luck"
1,"""Archfilejockey"" quoted Kent Hovind as saying: ""Asking an atheist why he can't find GOD is like asking a thief why he can't find a police officer.""Unfortunately for Kent Hovind, he has no problem finding police officers and prison guards in his current residence - he's serving time in federal prison for tax-related crimes.  Hovind is a Young Earth Creationist and has the dubious distinction of having other Young Earth Creationist individuals and organizations such as Answers in Genesis criticize his excessive zeal.  Quoting such ardent defenders of Young Earth Creationism as Kent Hovind in defense of intelligent design creationism is anathema to the Discovery Institute, as they continue to try desperately to convince the world that intelligent design creationism has scientific merit rather than religious merit."

1,"I understand the ad hominem approach chosen by Joe, after all, what is the alternative? Showing that ID really lives up to what Joe claims it is?--Joe GAnd again the design inference relies on observations, data, and experience. And as with all scientific inferences future research can either confirm or refute that inference.That is how science operates.---Actually the design inference relies on the absence of these to infer something they call 'design' based not upon a positive hypothesis, but rather based on an eliminative approach called the 'explanatory filter' which concludes that lacking a scientific explanation we should infer 'design' even though design cannot compete with our ignorance, and even though design still may include a natural designer such as variation and selection. In other words, ID is a placeholder where, lacking sufficient explanations, it argues, nay insists that we call it 'design' just because it looks designed. The overlap with Paley should be self evident but things get worse when ID proponents attempt to validate the approach by claiming that this is how science works.In fact, this is NOT how science works, as can be trivially shown by noticing that ID refuses to constrain its designer by such scientific approaches as used in criminology which include means, motives, opportunity, as well as eye witnesses, physical evidence and circumstantial evidences. No, ID cannot rely on such because, by relying on what science has come to identify as 'rarefied' design, it has effectively chosen an approach which cannot even compete with 'we don't know' as it provides no positive hypotheses.So let's expose the scientific vacuity of ID once again:How does ID explain the genetic code/bacterial flagella and how does its 'explanation' compares to how science explains these?The lack of explanations from ID, combined with its silly name calling, should be sufficient evidence of its scientific vacuity."
1,"--DI--As I explained in my fourth opening statement, design can be inferred regardless of whether the designer is natural or supernatural. ---That of course is incorrect and has been discussed many times now, although the ID proponents do not seem to have a response, which is fine. It's the bait and switch between ordinary design for which we have some independent evidence, and rarefied design which lack such distinction which makes the latter one highly unreliable.Ask yourself this simple question: How does ID explain the bacterial flagella?It doesn't, it merely calls it 'designed' which is a placeholder for our ignorance as to how to explain the flagella. But it gets worse, ID is doomed to sit back idling while science has continued to expand its knowledge of the flagella and likely evolutionary pathways. And while ID could not even compete with our ignorance, it now faces an even bigger challenge, namely a scientific hypothesis.That my friends is why ID has to resort to equivocation on the terms natural and supernatural, to include 'intelligence' as a supernatural cause.What a shame that good science is used to support such a vacuous notion"

Do you wish to specify other types of intelligent agents that you are observing?  Ants?  Chimpanzees?  Computers?  Hmm.  It seems that you would mainly observe us humans.So what makes you think that observing human intelligence means that ""intelligence is a property which we can generally understand""?  I think you are committing the fallacy of trying to appeal to ""common sense"" in a very inappropriate manner.Humans are intelligent.Humans design things.Living entities appear designed.Therefore there must be some natural or supernatural designer who designed those living things.But, of course, this is a silly non sequitur.""An underlying assumption of ID is that intelligence is a property which we can generally understand through our observations of intelligent agents in the natural world.""I think your assumption is false as a generalization.

For you, obviously life is intelligently designed, but you refuse to get serious about who, how, why or when this intelligent agent actually did something in this natural world.Well, you can't have a ""theory"" of ""intelligent design"" without actually saying something about what actually happened so that your ""theory"" would actually mean something.""allowing us to detect design in biology""Nonsense.""I explained that the refusal of ID proponents to use ID to draw scientific conclusions about the nature or identity of the designer is principled rather than merely rhetorical.""Riiight.  And that's one very good reason why there is no such thing as a theory of intelligent design.""Thus for the scientific theory of ID to try to identify the designer would be to inappropriately conflate science with religion.""And to fail to even think about the attributes required for the designer means that there is no such thing as the ""theory of ID"".  You are making ""observations"" and jumping to your  conclusion and there's nothing in between that would generate a ""theory""."
2,"1) Without a scientific definition of ""natural"", scientists cannot distinguish between natural explanations and supernatural ones.  Since they cannot make this distinction, they lack a scientifically-based justification for insisting that supernatural explanations be kept out of science.2) When actually doing science, scientists do not care if their explanations are natural.  Their only concern is if an explanation leads to predictions.  The predictive power is all that matters in science.  A supernatural explanation that leads to accurate predictions is better for science than a natural explanation that does not lead to accurate predictions.  Conceptions of ""natural"" and ""supernatural"" are relevant only in philosophy.3) ""Everything that exists"" is the only adequate definition of ""natural"" that I have been given by someone opposed to religion.  If this is a proper definition, then God and/or the intelligent designer would be natural according to science.  Therefore, anti-IDists' ""It-Uses-The-Supernatural-To-Explain"" argument would be moot."
2,"You're right, much if not all of the claims about ""supernatural claims/premises of ID make it invalid"" rest on some faulty views on what supernatural actually means. My main criticism of anyone who tries to disqualify ID from science (because it has the implication that supernatural forces might exist) is that they usually fail to make the distinction between the IMPLICATIONS of a theory and the EVIDENCE for a theory. It wouldn't matter if the force behind design is a supernatural entity because if we make those conclusions based on what we OBSERVE in physics or biological systems then we can safely say it's testable. If we applied the same standard that critics of ID are applying to everything else in science, then we may as well conclude the big bang isn't science (since that has supernatural implications of a first cause).    "
1,Natural: pertaining to or part of the observable world.  Something that behaves according to physical laws.Supernatural:  pertaining to something beyond the observable world.  Something that does not behave according to physical laws.
2,I don't really believe in the supernatural unless you wanted to say that the first cause behind the big bang is beyond the observable world and therefor supernatural. Everything after the beginning is natural. What we think of as supernatural is just that which   science   hasn't figured out yet. 
1,"Einstein's quotes are not supportive of ID, he was talking about the fabric of the universe, not the means by which species evolve. This is a common shell game played by ID proponents. They setup some premise based on the creation of the universe then draw a conclusion about evolution and hope that no one notices. Evolution and the creation of the universe (or the fabric of the universe) are not the same issue."
1,"But where does that leave ID?  Without a theory for the designer then that aspect remains unknown, and would thus be called supernatural."
2,ID without a designer? The cause of the big bang is unknown. Does that make it supernatural?
1,"The cause of the big bang is currently unknown, but it is also undergoing investigation.  Once a theory is found then where will that leave the supernatural?  Where will it leave the designer?"
1,"The Ayn Rand Center and I agree, for once, about the fact that ID is nothing more than bait and switch and that ID at best is a religiously motivated attack on science, as the DI seems to admit in their own Wedge Document. As a Christian myself, I have a hard time understanding why 'bait and switch' would further a Christian message. But perhaps I am missing something here."
2,"If ID is bait and switch, then so is   evolution  , considering that it's proponents tend to sell it off starting with the least extreme definition and just move on up from there:  http://intelligentdesign.podomatic.com/enclosure/2007-01-05T12_05_59-08_00.mp3  I like the concepts Ayn Rand promoted. This is sad. "
2,"In science, testing a hypothesis or theory means deriving predictions from them. Thus, if I hypothesize that species have changed over time, then I predict that million-year-old fossils will indicate similarities with species today but with stark differences.  It follows, then, that if predictions cannot be derived from the supernatural, then neither can if-then arguments be developed against it.  For example, one could not logically argue that if God is all-good, then there would be no evil because this is deriving predictions from the supernatural.Nevertheless, every atheist who passionately opposes theism, religion, and ID has made these arguments.  In ""God: The Failed Hypothesis"", physicist Victor Stenger even proposed to develop a scientific model of God that he claimed could be used to test the God hypothesis.  Naturally, he found that his model did not hold and therefore God does not exist.  But did the scientific community chastise him for baiting-and switching, for pretending like science can make statements about God when it really can't?  Of course not!  This is because his conclusions concerning the hypothesis were in the negative.  What matters to atheist scientists is not the evidence, but whether the evidence can be interpreted as atheistic.  If it can, then the evidence is strong.  If it cannot, then it is weak.  These are my predictions using self-verification theory.  Let's see if my predictions are supported by evidence."
1,"You are using the common tactic of forcing someone to disprove a negative.  There is no ""if-then"" argument required for something which has absolutely no evidence.  According to your reasoning I am justified in inventing anything that pops into my head and it is incumbent upon you to disprove it.  This is not science.P.S. - Characterizing atheists as ""passionate"" is like calling a rationalist ""emotional"".  "
2,"There is nothing wrong with asking someone to disprove a negative, that is, with asking someone to provide evidence contrary to a claim.  You call it a tactic, I call it reason.I agree that ""if-then"" arguments against God are not required.  Nevertheless, many atheists develop them with great enthusiasm.  If you have a problem with them doing this, then please take up your complaint with them.You are justified for inventing ideas.  This is what philosophy is all about.  We use our imaginations to try to figure stuff out, and we invent explanations or concepts to help us deal with problems.  If the invented idea sounds reasonable to some, but not me, then if I want to persuade people to abandon that idea I will have to use my imagination to invent an idea that conflicts with and/or is better than the idea they have adopted.Here are the two contradictory statements:  1) ""The supernatural cannot be tested.""2) ""If the Judeo-Christian God exists, then there should be no gratuitous evil.  If God is perfect, then the world should be perfect.  If God exists, then no one should be a disbeliever because God would make his existence obvious to everyone, etc, etc.  Therefore, the God hypothesis is false or probably false.""p.s. Atheists are human beings, and as such are passionate about some things.  I don't know why you think they are not emotionally attached to anything.  Perhaps it is because you have never debated with them?"
1,"--Casey Luskin--First, The Ayn Rand Institute’s arguments offend the First Amendment’s protections on religious freedom: scientists have freedom of religion and their scientific views should not be disqualified due to their alleged religious motives or beliefs. Moreover, as I explain in my third opening statement, the religious beliefs and motives of a scientist are irrelevant to whether they are scientifically correct:--That is true, but in case of ID, it is the combination of the well described motivations of the Discovery Institute combined with the lack of scientific content of Intelligent Design which makes this an issue beyond academic freedom. While ID proponents surely have the right to voice their position, they, given the above facts, do not necessarily have the right to be heard in public schools under the pretense of 'academic freedom'. The lack of scientific relevance and the strong religious motivations cause ID to be entangled with its creationist history"
1,"This objection highlights one of the problems with public education: the government should not be in the position of deciding what people ought to believe about science anymore than they should decide what people ought to believe about religion. We should have a separation of education and state for the same reason that we have a separation of church and state. So long as education remains in the government's hands, however, it must not introduce religion into public education. As ARI makes clear, ID is nothing more than religion with a pseudo-scientific veneer. It does not belong in the public schools. "
1,"Science is ultimately based on the scientific method, which is used to support and confirm physical and chemical laws. It is the application of those laws to the past that makes natural history possible and the application of those same laws to the future that makes it possible to make predictions. The question is, what physical and chemical laws are in play in Intelligent Design? We know evolution is scientific because it does not contradict any scientific laws, we can make predictions based on evolutionary theory, and we can falsify it by finding a possible mechanism that would prevent mutations from accumulating beyond a certain limit, making evolution beyond the limits of a ""created kind"" impossible. But we have found no such thing, ever.You cannot test to see if something in biology is ""intelligently designed"" by reference to scientific laws. Instead, you would ASSUME something is designed just because it looks complex and specific, but such complexity is indeed possible via natural selection, because complex organisms may have survival value over less complex organisms. DNA, RNA, and proteins are polymers, molecules that are made of repeating parts, and they can actually be of unlimited length, so their complexity is also unlimited.In short, there is NO evidence for Intelligent Design. None. It is theology, nothing more."
2,......your half right. 
1,"The DI is quick to argue that Jones overstepped its bound by declaring ID not be scientific even though both the plaintiffs and the defendants insisted that the Judge address this because the existence of a valid secular purpose which is not a sham is an important aspect in determining if something is unconstitutional--Judge Jones--Defendants Presented No Convincing Evidence that They were Motived by Any Valid Secular PurposeAlthough Defendants attempt to persuade this Court that each Board member who voted for the biology curriculum change did so for the secular purposed of improving science education and to exercise critical thinking skills, their contentions are simply irreconcilable with the record evidence. Their asserted purposes are a sham, and they are accordingly unavailing, for the reasons that follow.We initially note that the Supreme Court has instructed that while courts are ""normally deferential to a State's articulation of a secular purpose, it is required that the statement of such purpose be sincere and not a sham."" Edwards, 482 U.S. at 586-87 (citing Wallace, 472 U.S. at 64)(Powell, J., concurring); id. at 75 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) . Although as noted Defendants have consistently asserted that the ID Policy was enacted for the secular purposes of improving science education and encouraging students to exercise critical thinking skills, the Board took none of the steps that school officials would take if these stated goals had truly been their objective. The Board consulted no scientific materials. The Board contacted no scientists or scientific organizations. The Board failed to consider the views of the District's science teachers. The Board relied solely on legal advice from two organizations with demonstrably religious, cultural, and legal missions, the Discovery Institute and the TMLC. Moreover, Defendants' asserted secular purpose of improving science education is belied by the fact that most if not all of the Board members who voted in favor of the biology curriculum change conceded that they still do not know, nor have they ever known, precisely what ID is. To assert a secular purpose against this backdrop is ludicrous.---Which is why the Judge concluded in his section on ""Is Intelligent Design Science""--Judge Jones--To conclude and reiterate, we express no opinion on the ultimate veracity of ID as a supernatural explanation. However, we commend to the attention of those who are inclined to superficially consider ID to be a true ""scientific"" alternative to evolution without a true understanding of the concept the foregoing detailed analysis. It is our view that a reasonable, objective observer would, after reviewing both the voluminous record in this case, and our narrative, reach the inescapable conclusion that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science.--Of course ID proponents are quick to raise the demarcation argument while failing to recognize that while it may be hard to define strict rules as to what is and is not science in advance, it is quite possible to recognize that ID fails to be scientifically relevant a posteriori."
2,"For goodness sakes guys, very few people are advocating the mandatory teaching of ID in schools.. This is simply scare rhetoric to get people worried.  Even the Discovery Institute is against this.  You know very well that what people want is simply the freedom to look at both sides of the issue. Open debate.  You would think that learning institutions would look on this favorably.  I think we all know the reason.  Their arguments would not stack up against the arguments of the ID side.  Fear is the main reason for trying to shut out ID ideas from even being discussed in the classroom.  And you know very well why ID scientists have a hard time getting their research published in peer journals.  Censorship of ID.  Please, how dumb do you think the public is?  Give us a little more credit!!  It is downright insulting the way the intelligentsia views the public at times.  They want us to bow at their feet and take their opinions as absolute truth.Look what happened to Richard Stenburg when he had the courage to allow an ID piece get published?  Scientists and his peers jumped all over him.  He lost his job and his reputation.  An e-mail smear campaign was purposefully put in place. They wanted to make him suffer to scare others from doing the same thing. So much pressure was put on the magazine that they promised never to publish such a piece again.  And you want ID scientists to publish their articles?  They would if you would allow them to do it.The Dover verdict was a farce.  The Judge simply copied large amounts of material word for word from the material he received from the ACLU.  This was a shameful low blow?  Why - if it is true?!!!  His mind was made up before he even heard the case.  Even the Discovery Institute was against what they were trying to do.  Granted, the Dover school board had religious people on it, but that doesn't mean that their religious views mean that we can dismiss the scientific arguments that may lend support to those views.  If so, let's dismiss all the evidence that lends support to the religious views of the Darwinists as well.What worldview a person holds should not be the issue.  It is the scientific evidence that is important.  If the evidence points to an ""unscientific"" worldview, then maybe, just maybe, the worldview of naturalism could be wrong?  That is a distinct possibility you know.  Scientists take it as a given when it is not a given.  So if it is wrong, there should be evidence, scientific evidence that does not fit with that worldview.  Disallowing a presentation of this evidence because the worldview allows for the existence of ""unscientific"" beings is not rational.  You can't censor out all opposing ideas and then say ""Look, all the evidence points to naturalism!""  Again, we are not as dumb as you think.Besides, if naturalism is the correct worldview, how do we know that we can even trust our own reasoning abilities?  Why would randomness produce laws of logic, information with specified complexity, consciousness, morality, spirituality, etc.  Again I agree that mandating the teaching of ID is wrong, but not because it is religious.  It does not deal with the religious side of the issue.  It simply says that there is scientific evidence for design.  Can't we agree that this is indeed a possibility???!!!"
1,"--tj10Look what happened to Richard Stenburg when he had the courage to allow an ID piece get published? Scientists and his peers jumped all over him. He lost his job and his reputation.---First of all his name is Sternberg or von Sternber, second of all, contrary to popular myth he did not lose his job. It helps to get at least these facts right and I understand that you may have gotten these flawed impressions from ID reports so let's look at the facts.As Schloss describes the portrayal of the Sternberg 'affair; in the movie ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed"" (ironic title...)---After the article was published, rumors circulated that Sternberg was a young earth creationist. He’s not. Rumors circulated that Sternberg, contrary to standard policy for scientific publications, did not send the paper out for peer review. He definitely did. It was also claimed that Sternberg did not conform to the journal’s typical standards for seeking input from an associate editor. This is contested. Finally, it has been documented that communication between those associated with the journal and the Smithsonian Institution (involved in the journal’s publication) and/or the National Center for Science Education (a leading anti-creationist organization) inquired about Sternberg’s religious beliefs, political affiliations, and even discussed whether he should be terminated, formally disciplined, or made to resign.21 And it was decided none of these things should occur.So what actually did happen? Sternberg stepped down from his post as editor, but everybody agrees this has nothing to do with the article, and his term was set to expire before it appeared anyway. He was not fired or asked to resign at the Smithsonian. In fact, he didn’t even have a job at the Smithsonian to begin with (he is an employee of the National Institutes of Health). His was a courtesy appointment as a researcher, which was not rescinded. But after the term ran out, it was commuted to a lower prestige designation. From here the claims seem to get considerably more modest and also a bit more difficult to adjudicate. Sternberg claims his name was taken off his door, he had to move to worse work space, had to trade in his master key for another key, had to endure bureaucratic demands that others did not, and had his access to collections restricted. TheSmithsonian claims some of this happened and some didn’t, but much of what did happen also happened to others for reasons of general policy, some even before the article came out. The worst case scenario – which does not seem altogether unlikely – is that Sternberg indeed experienced a hostile work environment. It seems clear that colleagues viewed him as having betrayed the standards and reputation (but not the policies) of the organization, they were ticked with him, and as is not uncommon in such situations, he was subjected to gossip and the diminution of discretionary professional courtesies. ---Source: Jeffrey P. Schloss ""The Expelled Controversy: Overcoming or Raising Walls of Division?"", Center for Faith, Ethics, and Life Sciences Westmont CollegeI will address the other ill informed statements by TJ10 in a later posting."
2,"Yes, you are right.  My bad.  His name is Sternberg, not Stenberg.  The government report on the issue validates the charges against the Smithsonian Institute. Paper victory:  A congressional committee found evidence for harassment and discrimination by the Smithsonian against Dr. Richard Sternberg, who had allowed publication of a pro-ID paper in a Smithsonian journal (see Evolution News).  The report listed numerous examples of spying, plotting, lying, scheming and creating a hostile environment against Dr. Sternberg by Smithsonian staff with the NCSE’s help.  Few regular citizens even know that this report exists though and no action or fine was put on the Institution or the NCSE for their role in this harrassment.  If you want to look at the report for yourself, here is a link to it:     http://www.richardsternberg.org/smithsonian.php     But it seems like you have already read this.You may be right about him not losing his job.  I'll back off what I said until I can verify it with Sternberg himself.   The point is, they made his life miserable, started a smear campaign, tried to ruin his reputation, and tried to make life so miserable for him that he would resign.  They succeeded and they were not punished for this at all.  Apparently all is fair in the evolution/ID war.  They wanted to make it clear that this kind of an article is never to be published by any kind of reputable science magazine.  Then they claim that ID scientists haven't published any articles to prove their point that it is not good science.  Go figure.Now, we all know that some articles have been published, but very few and the Sternberg controversy shows why the numbers of articles that have been published is so few.Thanks for pointing out my errors!tj"
1,"--TJ10The government report on the issue validates the charges against the Smithsonian Institute. --In fact, the report shows exactly what Schloss reported. Seems that few people have actually read the report which includes the actual emails on which the report relied.TJ10, lacking in accuracy in his previous posting, is not holding back--TJ10The point is, they made his life miserable, started a smear campaign, tried to ruin his reputation, and tried to make life so miserable for him that he would resign.--Again not supported by the facts.Why is it that ID proponents tend to be so sloppy with  facts? I can understand that if one relies on ID sources for one's story, one may indeed be led to believe these 'facts' but with all the primary sources so readily available, there is no excuse for relying on 'hearsay'. Especially when some ID proponents have such a poor record in presenting the full story.  "

Moreover, the agency’s top officials—Secretary Lawrence Small and Deputy Secretary Sheila Burke—have shown themselves completely unwilling to rectify the wrongs that were done or even to genuinely investigate the wrongdoing. Most recently, Burke and Small have allowed NMNH officials to demote Dr. Sternberg to the position of Research Collaborator, despite past assurances from Burke that Dr. Sternberg was a “Research Associate in good standing” and would be given “full and fair consideration” for his request to renew his Research Associateship. 2 The failure of Small and Burke to take any action against such discrimination raises serious questions about the Smithsonian’s willingness to protect the free speech and civil rights of scientists who may hold dissenting views on topics such as biological evolution. ** Would these major findings back up what you are saying or what I am saying? **Major findings of this staff investigation include: ?Officials at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History created a hostile work environment intended to force Dr. Sternberg to resign his position as a Research Associate in violation of his free speech and civil rights. There is substantial, credible evidence of efforts to abuse and harass Dr. Sternberg, including punitively targeting him for investigation in order to supply a pretext for dismissing him, and applying to him regulations and restrictions not imposed on other researchers. Given the factual record, the Smithsonian’s pro-forma denials of discrimination are unbelievable?In emails exchanged during August and September 2004, NMNH officials revealed their intent to use their government jobs to discriminate against scientists based on their outside activities regarding evolution. ?The hostility toward Dr. Sternberg at the NMNH was reinforced by anti-religious and political motivations. Dr. Sternberg’s OSC complaint describes efforts to discover or disparage his supposed religious and political beliefs, and the OSC investigation concluded that there was “a strong religious and political component to the actions taken after the publication of the Meyer article.” ?NMNH officials conspired with a special interest group on government time and using government emails to publicly smear Dr. Sternberg; the group was also enlisted to monitor Sternberg’s outside activities in order to find a way to dismiss him. In cooperation with the pro-evolution National Center for Science Education (NCSE), Museum officials attempted to publicly smear and discredit Dr. Sternberg with false and defamatory information.?	Secretary Small and Deputy Secretary Burke have exhibited a head-in-the-sand attitude toward wrongdoing at their agency; they have engaged in stonewalling and spin rather than dealing forthrightly with the discrimination that has occurred.    http://www.souder.house.gov/_files/IntoleranceandthePoliticizationofScienceattheSmithsonian.pdf    tj"

1,"The congressional report comes from the similar sources that have denied the existence or problems of global warming as well. Seems that one has to dive a bit deeper before pointing to a politically motivated report as evidence.Look at the emails that were provided and which led to the conclusions and see if you are willing to defend any one of them?See for instance    http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/12/creating_a_martyr_the_sternber.php    In particular--4. The accusations, in particular, against the National Center for Science Education - that they conspired with Smithsonian officials to ""publicly smear and discredit"" Sternberg - are not only not supported by the evidence in the appendix, they are completely disproven by the emails contained therein.--    http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/the-office-of-s.html        http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/04/now-in-the-do-a.html    "
1,"--Eventually, they [the Smithsonian higher-ups] determined that they could not terminate you [Sternberg] for cause and they were not going to make you a “martyr” by firing you for publishing a paper on ID. They came to the conclusion that you had not violated SI directives and that you could not be denied access for off-duty conduct. This was actually a part of the strategy advocated by the NCSE. (OSC opinion, p. 5)--So how does this compare with --NMNH officials conspired with a special interest group on government time and using government emails to publicly smear Dr. Sternberg; the group was also enlisted to monitor Sternberg’s outside activities in order to find a way to dismiss him. In cooperation with the pro-evolution National Center for Science Education (NCSE), Museum officials attempted to publicly smear and discredit Dr. Sternberg with false and defamatory information.--So the NCSE advocated a strategy which opposed dismissing him, contrary to the claims in the report TJ10 quotes from.Should that not set off some warning lights?Ed Brayton did an even more in depth analysis--Now let's look at another set of false accusations in the report, those made against the National Center for Science Education. The report claims:    NMNH officials conspired with a special interest group on government time and using government emails to publicly smear Dr. Sternberg; the group was also enlisted to monitor Sternbergs outside activities in order to find a way to dismiss him. In cooperation with the pro-evolution National Center for Science Education (NCSE), Museum officials attempted to publicly smear and discredit Dr. Sternberg with false and defamatory information.Not only is this claim not supported by the emails in the appendix, it is flatly contradicted by them. The emails that Genie Scott exchanged were full of admonitions to Smithsonian personnel not to do the things they are now accused of conspiring to do. She urged them not to attack his religious views so as not to make him a martyr. Genie repeatedly tells them to focus solely on the questions of impropriety and see whether they can be proven. She also tells them that Sternberg should not be judged on the basis of his religious views or his creationist views, but solely on the basis of his work as a scientist. She says (p. 32):  --  On the other hand, his creationist views should not be the main focus of the criticism. First, if he can do good standard science, that's all we care about. Newton did pretty good science, and had some pretty nutty additional ideas about reality, too. So if he keeps the nut stuff out of his basically descriptive work, that's fine. His science should stand or fall on its own.And in a follow up email she wrote:--    I guess the big question is whether he is a good enough scientist to remain there. If his non-creationist work is good, then I think he deserves the job. If not, and if others are let go under the same circumstances, then let the chips fall where they may. But none of us are after this guy's job. That isn't the point of this exercise, in my opinion.In addition, she urged them to focus not on his views but on the real questions of impropriety surrounding the publishing of the Meyer article and his poor judgment:--    If there are repercussions for von Sternberg from the article, they should be because of his poor judgement in publishing it (your comments about editorial ""fairness"" are well taken). Therefore, this incident should be handled carefully, I believe.Clearly, she is urging great caution and arguing that they should not consider his views at all, but only his professional behavior, in handling the situation. The section of the report dealing with the NCSE, beginning on page 22, in fact contains not a shred of evidence, indeed not even an accusation, in support of the claim that the NCSE had, along with Smithsonian officials, ""attempted to publicly smear and discredit Dr. Sternberg with false and defamatory information.""--Source: Ed Brayton, ""Creating a Martyr: The Sternberg Saga Continues"", Talk Reason website    http://www.talkreason.org/articles/martyr.cfm    "
1,"Grayling explains, in his review of Fuller's latest book, quite well how ID is doomed to remain scientifically vacuous--Fuller has written about Popper; he seems to forget Popper’s killer point, namely, a theory that explains everything explains nothing. ID is such a theory; everything is consistent with it, nothing disproves it. The idea that there is such a thing as a deity behaves logically as a contradiction does (unsurprisingly, because the idea is indeed contradictory): anything whatever follows from it. (But presumably this is okay for Fuller because he was educated by Jesuits.)--AC Grayling, Origin of the specious, New, Humanist, Volume 123 Issue 5 September/October 2008     http://newhumanist.org.uk/1856    In his response, Fuller shows that he has fallen victim to the bait and switch of ID--FullerBut on to Grayling’s most glaring deficiency vis-à-vis the topic of Dissent over Descent: his sheer ignorance of ID’s argument structure, which is not that of a Young Earth Creationist (YEC) who looks for whatever evidence supports his pet theory. Generally speaking, ID is defended on the basis of what philosophers of science call “inference to the best explanation” for the plausibility of design over chance in nature--But ID is NOT about an inference to the best explanation, something trivially shown by asking any ID proponent how ID explains the bacterial flagella, which due to lack of sufficient scientific understanding was claimed to have been 'designed'Of course, this somewhat foolish argument sets up Fuller for a scathing response--Grayling:I am, says Fuller, ignorant (sheerly so; this is the glaring deficiency in my case) of ""ID's argument structure"", which is - argument to the best explanation! Oh pul-eese! I ignored this bit in my review out of a kind of residual collegiality, for even among the toxicities that flow when members of the professoriate fall out, embarrassment on others"" behalf is a restraint. But he asks for it. Argument to the best explanation! Look: there is a great deal we do not know about this world of ours, but what is beautiful about science is that its practitioners do not panic and say ""cripes! we don't understand this, so we must grab something quick - attribute it to the intelligent designing activity of Fred (or Zeus or the Tooth Fairy or any arbitrary supernatural agency given ad hoc powers suitable to the task) because we can't at present think of a better explanation."" They do not make a hasty grab for a lousy ""best explanation"" because they have serious thoughts about the kind of thing that can count as such. Instead of quick ad hoc fixes, they live with the open-ended nature of scientific enquiry, hypothesising and testing, trying to work things out rationally and conservatively on the basis of what is so far well-attested and secure. What looks like having a chance of being both an ""explanation"" and the ""best"" in a specific case turns on there being a well-disciplined idea of ""best"" for that specific case. But an hypothesis has no hope of becoming the best explanation (until a better comes along) unless it survives testing, is specific, and is consistent and conservative with respect to much else that is secure. This is a far cry from the gestural ""best explanation"" move that ID theorists attempt, which - and note this carefully - does not restrict itself to individual puzzles only, but applies to Life, the Universe and Everything. It has to, at risk of incoherence; and yet by doing so, it collapses into incoherence.--Well said. Seems that many people have fallen victim of the erroneous claim that ID is an inference to the best explanation. After all he should have consulted Dembski who is on the records as--DembskiAs for your example, I’m not going to take the bait. You’re asking me to play a game: ”Provide as much detail in terms of possible causal mechanisms for your ID position as I do for my Darwinian position.” ID is not a mechanistic theory, and it’s not ID’s task to match your pathetic level of detail in telling mechanistic stories. If ID is correct and an intelligence is responsible and indispensable for certain structures, then it makes no sense to try to ape your method of connecting the dots. True, there may be dots to be connected. But there may also be fundamental discontinuities, and with IC systems that is what ID is discovering.--Are there still any ID proponents out there willing to defend the position? "
1,"--TJ10--It is the scientific evidence that is important. If the evidence points to an ""unscientific"" worldview, then maybe, just maybe, the worldview of naturalism could be wrong? That is a distinct possibility you know. Scientists take it as a given when it is not a given.--In fact, scientists do not take the worldview of naturalism as a given, but rather use a _method_ of methodological naturalism to guide them in their scientific research and hypothesis forming. Now, ID proponents have systematically represented the issue erroneously as naturalism when it is methodological naturalism, a confusion started with Philip Johnson. Even though Denis Lamoureux attempted to educate Phil, it seems that the damage was done.In the recent movie, ""Expelled"" the claim is made by Stein that it ""“appears Darwinism does lead to atheism.”As Schloss explains in his 33 page review, this is an important claim and it is wrong--This is a hugely important claim, which is undoubtedly the core issue in the cultural debate over ID. It is the reason the ID movement musters such passionate commitment and why it is, in fact, a “movement” at all. In the movie, ID proponent Jeffrey Schwartz concludes, “The conflict over the principles of evolution has become a religious war; it is no longer a conflict over science.” Whether or not the debate was ever primarily over science, the film is correct in identifying it as being a world-view conflict that is largely religious in character. The question we desperately need to address is whether this is a conflict that must be fought, and what is the evidence presented in the movie for going to battle?

2,"OK, you are right on this point as well.  There is a difference between methodological naturalism and naturalism.  I am still learning here.  However, whether a scientist is a methodological naturalist or a true naturalist really doesn't matter.  When they do their work, they do it assuming naturalism to be true.  In other words, they allow no possibility for supernatural explanations or causes.  This is even more difficult to understand if the person is not a true naturalist. Who says that scientists need to approach science from the perspective of naturalism?  Who made that rule?  Is it valid?  No. Of course not.  Because they are dismissing the possibility of a Designer, or any and all supernatural causes for the effects they study from the beginning.  There is no rational reason why this should be.  I mean think about it.  Why would someone who is not a naturalist assume that worldview only when he does science?  Unless it is possible to prove that God does not exist (which it isn’t), to simply assume that He does not even if it is only in methodology, would be irrational.How the world came to be and the natural forces at work in the universe right now are not necessarily connected.  For instance the forces that make a car and the principles that enable it to work are different. Just because the forces that enable the car to work are natural does not automatically mean that the forces that created it to begin with are natural as well.  This is an arbitrary and illogical conclusion.  To block out all other answers is not rational.I agree with you though that Darwinism does not automatically lead a person to atheism. There are a lot of inconsistent Christians around.  There are a lot of inconsistent evolutionists around as well.  However, if naturalism is true, then it does lead to that conclusion.  Since Darwinism is based on naturalism, even if only methodological naturalism, it is a very simple step to atheism from there.  Many have taken that step when they started to believe in Darwinism and understood the implications of that view on the Bible and religion.  God is no longer ""necessary"" in their eyes. As Oxford evolutionist and antitheist Richard Dawkins claimed, it was impossible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist before Darwin. The implication is that now it has become possible.  Stein should have said that Darwin made it much easier to become an atheist rather than Darwin leads to atheism.  It does not in every case.  He simply overstated the problem.tjtjIn the recent movie, ""Expelled"" the claim is made by Stein that it ""“appears Darwinism does lead to atheism.”As Schloss explains in his 33 page review, this is an important claim and it is wrong--This is a hugely important claim, which is undoubtedly the core issue in the cultural debate over ID.

In other words, they allow no possibility for supernatural explanations or causes. This is even more difficult to understand if the person is not a true naturalist.---Such is the nature of science. And yes it does matter since a scientist can believe in a God and still use methodological naturalism as a method. Also, they do not exclude the possibility of the supernatural a priori, but rather a posteriori since the supernatural fails to explain anything since it can explain everything.Imagine a scientists looking at how a particular system works. Hmm, too hard to understand, poof must have been designed. Next part, hmmm looks intricate, let's invoke the 'poof explanation' again, this is taking too long.The reason scientists have come to accept MN as a valid tool is because it works so well."
2,"Well, isn't that what the whole debate here is about.  There are a growing number of scientists who do not believe that methodological naturalism can answer or solve all the difficult problems of the origin of life and evolution.  Methodological naturalism works well in the here and now, but when we go back to origins, the past, when we cannot see what actually happened, a lot of interpretation is necessary.  It cannot be repeated so is in some senses, not true science.  Your opinion is that it works so well.  Fine.  A growing number of scientists are standing up and saying ""Hey, wait a minute, when it comes to origins, methodological materialism is lacking.""  ID is about showing evidence to support this idea.Again, you may have faith that methodological materialism will solve all of these problems in the distant future.  Great.  That is your belief.  However, it is nothing more than that - a belief, a stand of faith.  There is no guarantee.ID scientists are saying ""I don't think that will happen and here is why.""

1,"--TJ10Again, you may have faith that methodological materialism will solve all of these problems in the distant future. Great. That is your belief. However, it is nothing more than that - a belief, a stand of faith. There is no guarantee.---Sure, we may have come to realize that MN is insufficient to address all problems, however why should we conclude 'design' based on just our ignorance. Just because there are some 'scientists' who believe something more is needed, this is neither sufficient justification and worse, they have failed to provide ANY method to extend the MN framework.The supernatural without constraints is no explanation since it explains anything.Hope you realize that ID scientists are given a voice to speak. But they somehow failed to speak, or perhaps they just whispered ?Why should we give credence to just anyone who makes ill supported claims? Do we still believe in a flat earth? What about cold fusion. At least these were falsifiable claims but ID is not in the business of presenting any scientific hypotheses relevant to ID, other than negative hypotheses about Darwinian theory.I do not believe that global warming is happening should not be an excuse for ignoring the facts. If ID proponents believe MN is insufficient then let them make their case: how does one reliably detect the design of God?And why should we expect that God was somehow forced to get involved in His original design? What explanatory power does it have to say that God designed 'x'? What if we replace God with 'magic pink unicorn'? What if science discovers a way to explain it ? Does this somehow disprove 'design'? What is meant by 'design'ID's contribution is not to show that MN is lacking but rather that our scientific explanations are lacking and even there, they fail to do much relevant work."

YMMV of course.As to atheism being so compatible with science, which includes evolutionary science, such is the power of atheism that it is not compelled to reject science in favor of their philosophical viewpoints."

Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.==Augustine (A.D. 354-430) ""The Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim)""  translated  by J.

Darwinism is as much a religion for many people as is Christianity.  Just because their worldview doesn't normally include the supernatural, does that mean their science is more valid than others with a supernatural worldview?  It shouldn't.  Basically what I'm saying is that Darwinists also have bias.  They look at everything through their faith in evolution.  Evolution is a given.  What is debatable is how it took place.  But if we don't know how it took place, how do we really know it did take place?  We don't.  They assume their theory to prove their theory.  Much of the evidence they claim supports it, is based on this kind of circular reasoning. The evidence is really a lot less convincing that you seem to think.  The whole rise of ID and continual flourishing of creationism even among respected PhDs, would seem to validate that there is controversy - that it is not yet a closed subject, even though many Darwinists would like to have us believe otherwise.

This is false and misleading.  ID does not attempt to fill gaps in science, it looks at the same evidence produced by science (eg, the mechanics of molecular biology) and draws an inference different from folks like PvM.  ID sees a complex system which  contains inter-dependent parts, assembled in a highly specific way, does the math on probability this arrangement could arise by chance and concludes the system is designed.

2,"I will address the post by Americans United for Separation of Church and State here and then address the question of constitutionality in another post.Let me begin by saying that this very topic is curious--""Intelligent Design is Unconstitutional.""  As a student of constitutional law, I failed to realize that concepts like those we are discussing here have constitutional merit.  Is gravity constitutional and astrology unconstitutional?  The fact that this title suggests we argue over whether or not intelligent design is constitutional is laughable.For the sake of argument, however, I'll accept that the Americans United for Separation of Church and State probably meant to say that the teaching of intelligent design is unconstitutional.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that the AUSCS would go so far as to say any presentation of or allusion to intelligent design in the science classroom is unconstitutional.  But is this the case?Let's start with the last sentence in the AUSCS's argument--that the Discovery Institute's response to Judge Jones was that he plagiarized his opinion and such a response is a low blow and ""not a scientific argument.""For beginners, that was not the Discovery Institute's argument.  The DI presented a number of objections--both scientific and legal--against Judge Jones' brief.  But the portion of the brief in question was not plagiarized, nor was the accusation leveled by the DI.  They claimed that a majority--a shocking majority--of this portion of the opinion was copied verbatim from the legal brief submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  This is not plagiarism.  In fact, judges do occasionally copy small portions of either the plaintiff or defendant's legal brief.  The complaint was that so much of the brief was copied--some 90+ percent--that it seemed that Judge Jones merely copied the ACLU's report without doing further research on the issue.  THAT is the argument put forth by the DI.Another argument that the AUSCS got wrong is the notion that intelligent design has never appeared in a single peer-reviewed journal.  This notion is blatantly false.  ID has indeed been peer-reviewed and, in fact, many pro-ID scientists have served as referees for other peer-reviewed journals.  But this, like the previous argument, has nothing on the question of constitutionality.But now the real problem with this argument that AUSCS makes.  First, did they seriously just call this argument a ""low blow?""  I disagree, but let's say they're right and this is a low blow.  Does being low suddenly make the argument wrong or false?  Remember, truth claims have nothing to do with how they are presented and neither does constitutionality.Now, I think we see why the AUSCS is wrong here--they call DI's argument ""not scientific.""  Well, while the debate between intelligent design and evolution should be scientific, the question of constitutionality is NOT a scientific one.  Never once in any of my many constitutional law classes, not in any of my law presentations or assignments, not once when I worked in the US Congress, was something ruled unconstitutional or illegal because of a scientific standard.  Let's remember what the question is--is the teaching/presentation of intelligent design in schools constitutional.  This question is not a scientific one--it is a legal one.Another point to remember is that Judge Jones' decision pertains to the case ""Kitzmiller v. Dover"" which was decided in 2005.  The case was not ""Intelligent Design v. US Constitution"" decided for all time.  In fact, on this issue, constitutional law scholars refer to other cases before the Dover trial--Epperson, Edwards, and so forth--and even those cases are not conclusive.  The US Constitution is a changing document--each case brings a new reading and interpretation to it.So is the teaching or discussing of intelligent design in public school science classes constitutional or not?  To find out, read my next post."
2,"In my previous post, I discussed by the AUSCS's arguments were flawed--both factually and logically.  Here, I want to discuss the matter of teaching and discussing intelligent design and whether this is constitutional or not.So what about intelligent design and the US Constitution?  Is it too religious?  Is it scientific?  Well, I hate to break it to the scientists here, but lawyers, judges, and constitutional law scholars don't care if something is scientific.  What they do use to judge whether a statute (claimed to be religious) is constitutional or not is the Lemon Test, a test that was born out of the 1971 case Lemon v. Kurtzman.  The Lemon Test brings a three-prong test to the debate.  They are:1. The statute must have a secular purpose.2. The statute must not have the primary purpose of advancing or inhibiting any religion.3. The statute must not result in the ""excessive entanglement"" between government and religion.If the statute fails any one of the three prongs, it fails the test.  Let's see how teaching/discussing intelligent design in public schools stacks up.1. Secular Purpose.  Note that this calls for the statute to have a secular purpose.  It does not ban the statute from having a religious purpose, it merely requires a secular one.  Does teaching/discussing ID have a secular purpose?  It has many.  For example, discussing ID can help students expand horizons.  It teaches students to think critically.  There are many others.  I remember in the eighth grade, when we had to learn about the Moon Hoax as a part of science class.  Whether it was right or wrong, whether it was wise to teach it, is all up for debate.  But it IS constitutional to discuss it in science class.2. Advancing and Inhibiting Any Religion.  It's hard to argue that teaching or discussing intelligent design advances any one religion.  After all, every religion (except for secular humanism, which the Supreme Court ruled as a religion in Torcaso v. Watkins) subscribes to the idea that life on earth was designed.  As for inhibiting religion--to make this case, you would have to argue that teaching or discussing intelligent design resulted in a ban on teaching or discussion evolution.  I don't see that happening.  In fact, the Discovery Institute has opposed measures to remove evolution from science curricula.  ID-proponents believe that evolution needs to be taught.  In fact, ID-proponents believe that all of evolution should be taught--both strengths AND weaknesses.  That is critical analysis--which, contrary to what evolutionists may say, is quite different that teaching creationism.  (How they confuses thinking critically with teaching creationism, I don't know.)3. Excessive Entanglement.  This is a tricky matter because it is difficult to pinpoint which circumstances would dictate excessive entanglement.  However, the ACLU mentioned one possible scenario in their brief submitted to Judge Jones.  They claim that if ID was presented in class and a student asked ""who was the designer?"" there is nothing that prevents the teacher from saying ""God.""  There are a few problems with this.First, as it stands now, there is nothing that prevents the teacher from saying ""God created all of you.""  Of course, he or she could be fired, but you could also fire them after answer ""God"" to the question of who is the designer.  Second, the teacher could just as well say ""we won't discuss that in class"" instead of answering ""God.""  Again, as things stand now, there's nothing to stop a student from raising his or her hand and saying ""I don't believe in evolution, I believe God made us.""  If this happens, we are in the same boat.  Finally, the ACLU claims that the teachers in Dover (and across America) don't want ID in their classroom.  They claim that these teachers are evolutionists.  If this is the case--then someone please explain to me why they would answer ""God"" to the question ""who was the designer?""  It doesn't make any sense.So in sum, no, a statute on teaching or discussing intelligent design leads to excessive entanglement between government and religion.  It engages religion less than a discussion on the reformation does in a history class.All in all, teaching or discussing intelligent design in a public school science class is not unconstitutional.  It passes all constitutional tests.  Again, it is important to remember that the question at hand is one dealing with the US Constitution.  It is a matter of law, NOT science.  The AUSCS began and ended their piece talking about ID on shaky scientific grounds.  It is no wonder they believe ID to be unconstitutional--they are using scientific methods to measure the constitution."

But it IS constitutional to discuss it in science class.--That is exactly what the DI tried to argue, that ID has some secular purpose. But SChen forgot an important part 'that is not a sham', and thus while talking about ID as a bad example of science is hardly unconstitutional or enforcable, ID itself is not to be discussed as part of the curriculum in a science class.ID has NO secular purposes that are not shams, the judge realized this and ruled appropriately."
2,"First, thanks for the reply. I appreciate a good discussion like the one we're having thus far.Second, I'm not sure I follow your argument.  To say that the Discovery Institute argues this as well doesn't tell me anything about whether the argument is right or wrong, good or bad, based upon it's merits.  In addition, we're not discussing whether ID should or ought to be discussed in science classes.  We're discussing whether doing so is constitional.  There is a world of difference between what should be done/is a good idea and what is constitionally permissible.Finally, to claim that ID has no secular purposes that are not shams is quite a claim to make.  You have, by making his claim, accepted the responsibility to find every possibly secular purpose of ID and demostrate with little doubt why it is a sham.  Remember--because you claimed that no such secular purposes exist whatsoever--you must negate each and every possible and potential secular purpose to prove your point.  Good luck."
1,"--Hghlander--This is false and misleading. ID does not attempt to fill gaps in science, it looks at the same evidence produced by science (eg, the mechanics of molecular biology) and draws an inference different from folks like PvM. ---While many unfamiliar with ID may believe this to be the case, and indeed, the Discovery Institute has done a good job confusing its followers, it is important to realize that this is exactly how ID works.I am sure that Highlander is familiar with the foundational works of Behe and Dembski, both rely on the absence of science being able to explain a particular feature to infer 'design'. --Highlander-- ID sees a complex system which contains inter-dependent parts, assembled in a highly specific way, does the math on probability this arrangement could arise by chance and concludes the system is designed. Period. No god, no gap filling.---That is incorrect as well, in fact in ID speak, complex means 'lacking scientific explanations', nothing more, nothing less. From this, ID conflates the meaning of complexity with what one has come to understand as complexity in science, which is not the same as how ID 'defines' it. Sneaky eh..But I can understand the levels of confusion. For instance, Highlander asserts that ID calculates the probability that something was designed by chance and then concludes 'design'. While this description only superficially matches the design inference, it shows the gap filling of ""not chance thus design"", nothing more, nothing less. Of course, ID has not done any non trivial calculations of probabilities and worse, it does not have to reject chance alone, which is often the simplest and still intractable calculation, but it also has to exclude regularity pathways. And yet, ask yourself, what calculations exist for the bacterial flagellum or any non trivial biological system?None I tell you. Surprised? I bet. This is but one reason ID has remained scientifically without content.--Highlander--I invite PvM to cite any leading ID theorist filling gaps in scientific knowledge with ID, as claimed above. Just one.---Dembski, Behe come to mind.Glad you asked. Many ID proponents are only vaguely familiar with ID."

You have, by making his claim, accepted the responsibility to find every possibly secular purpose of ID and demostrate with little doubt why it is a sham.---Not really, one has but to look at what ID claims the so called secular purposes of ID are, they all center around the fallacious belief  that ID is a scientifically relevant concept. Sure, DI can dream up yet another purpose, and they have ""academic freedom"" and when such purposes surface they can be quickly put to rest. Remember that the law is not interested in what ID could possibly be, but rather what it is argued to be. Sure, ID could have a yet to be uncovered valid secular purpose, but so far the ones proposed where all shown to be without merit.--Judge JonesAny asserted secular purposes by the Board are a sham and are merely secondary to a religious objective. McCreary, 125 S. Ct. at 2735; accord, e.g., Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 308 (“it is . . . the duty of the courts to ‘distinguish a sham secular purpose from a sincere one.’” (citation omitted)); Edwards, 482 U.S. at 586-87 (“While the Court is normally deferential to a State’s articulation of a secular purpose, it is required that the statement of such purpose be sincere and not a sham.”). Defendants’ previously referenced flagrant and insulting falsehoods to the Court provide sufficient and compelling evidence for us to deduce that any allegedly secular purposes that have been offered in support of the ID Policy are equally insincere.Accordingly, we find that the secular purposes claimed by the Board amount to a pretext for the Board’s real purpose, which was to promote religion in the public school classroom, in violation of the Establishment Clause.---And the judge put to rest any hope that ID may have some scientific relevance that is not a sham    http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover_decision2.html    #p121The Discovery Institute proposed, in their amicus filings, several reasons why ID has a valid secular purpose, none withstood the scrutiny of law."
1,"When the Supreme Court formulated 'valid secular purpose which is not a sham', the court unlikely believed that any future, unstated secular purpose would be sufficient for something to pass this requirement. That would make the rule unenforceable. Instead, one has to go from what the arguments presented are.Now if the DI believes that some valid secular purpose may exist, then it is up to them to present said claims. I understand that ""academic freedom"" is their latest variant to avoid dealing with the fact that ID is without scientific content."
1,"--Discovery Institute Amicus Curiae bried:Valid secular purposes for teaching students about the theory of intelligent design include: *  informing students about competing theories of biological origins as  they exist within the scientific community,--There are no competing theories of biological origins, certainly ID provides none --* helping students to better understand neo-Darwinism by  understanding a theory with which it competes,--Again, there is no competing theory of ID.--* enhancing critical thinking skills by exposing students to alternative  explanations for the origin of life,--There are no alternative explanation provided by ID. --* helping students to understand the value of dissenting viewpoints in the advancement of scientific knowledge,--Students need to know about any and all 'dissenting opinion or viewpoint', especially when lacking traction as a scientifically relevant contribution.-- *increasing student interest in science by exposing them to current  debates within the scientific community,10 and  --The debate within the scientific community over ID is over.-- • advancing cultural literacy by helping students understand a current  controversy about science and science education policy.1--There are no controversies related to ID.Sham on you...."

Those who have hailed Jones as some sort of philosopher-king have been badly misled.--This is particularly funny because it was Behe who seems to have not only failed to communicate the academic issues to the Judge, but also it was Behe who was extensively quoted in the judge's ruling as to why ID was scientifically without merit.From reading the whole ruling, it become painfully clear that the judge was very aware of the scientific issues involved, he just happened to disagree with the spin provided by the defendants and their witnesses. I wonder if the Judge would have been able to make such an effective ruling without the contributions and testimonies of Michael Behe.For instance--Stated another way, ID posits that animals did not evolve naturally through evolutionary means but were created abruptly by a non-natural, or supernatural, designer. Defendants' own expert witnesses acknowledged this point. (21:96-100 (Behe); P-718 at 696, 700 (""implausible that the designer is a natural entity""); 28:21-22 (Fuller) ("". . . ID's rejection of naturalism and commitment to supernaturalism . . .""); 38:95-96 (Minnich) (ID does not exclude the possibility of a supernatural designer, including deities).It is notable that defense experts' own mission, which mirrors that of the IDM itself, is to change the ground rules of science to allow supernatural causation of the natural world, which the Supreme Court in Edwards and the court in McLean correctly recognized as an inherently religious concept. Edwards, 482 U.S. at 591-92; McLean, 529 F. Supp. at 1267. First, defense expert Professor Fuller agreed that ID aspires to ""change the ground rules"" of science and lead defense expert Professor Behe admitted that his broadened definition of science, which encompasses ID, would also embrace astrology. (28:26 (Fuller); 21:37-42 (Behe)). Moreover, defense expert Professor Minnich acknowledged that for ID to be considered science, the ground rules of science have to be broadened to allow consideration of supernatural forces. (38:97 (Minnich)).--A fascinating reading indeed which shows a well informed judge making a powerful ruling which ID proponents.

1,"--As explained on that page, some of the scientific journals and other prestigious academic sources that have published peer-reviewed scientific publications by ID proponents supporting core ID arguments include:--And then the Discovery Institute continues to claim some journals, without providing much of any reference to the actual papers. And for good reason because there are trivially few if any, ID relevant scientific papers. While ID is known to quickly claim that papers support their viewpoint, the many authors of said papers have come forward, strongly disagreeing with said claims. ID has few if any ID relevant papers. It's as simple as that. Perhaps the poster would like to identify a single relevant article for us to address in more depth?As to Judge Jones extensive use of the ACLU's ""proposed ‘Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law’"", the DI initially suggested strongly that something was fishy about this, of course, over time they may have toned down their rhetoric showing that the ACLU was well prepared in briefing the Judge about the case. As to evidence, all that ID can do is use ill defined concepts to argue that our ignorance should indeed be seen as evidence of design, combine this with an equivocation on such terminologies as design and information and one quickly realizes that ID is all about Bait and Switch.If ID has merit, then explain how ID explains the bacterial flagellum.The silence will be deafening I predict."
2,""" We focus only on the constitutional aspects to this issue. Americans United's main point is that the teaching of intelligent design in public schools is unconstitutional. It is religion, not science. Judge Jones agreed with us. The Kitzmiller case is over. ""Oh really?  The 'unconstitutional' premise, which resulted in a legal 'conclusion' by Judge Jones, was based on his interpretation of (1) The Establishment Clause, (2) The Lemon Test, and (3) his definition of 'religion.'  Without taking up space analyzing the first two, addressing the third negates the relevance of the first two.In the Lemon v Kurtzman ruling, as in virtually all other Supreme Court cases, religion has not been defined, although in lower court cases, it has in some cases been defined in a narrow or broad sense, according to what the jurist(s) felt was needed to adjudicate a particular case. One of the main problems then, in applying the Lemon Test, is a proper interpretation of the term 'religion'.  Referring to excerpts from the Utah Law Review published by arn.org, this topic is addressed, with citations from relevant court cases.pg. 47  ""Though the courts have generally resisted formulating definitions ofreligion, the Ninth Circuit test articulated in Peloza v. Capistrano UnifiedSchool District226 and Alvarado v. City of San Jose227 stands as a clearexception to that rule.""  Similar to the Lemon Test, it consists of (3) qualifications for a motive to be religious.  I'll list those three, along with my interpretation.""First, a religion addresses fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters.""My take:  ID seeks empirical and statistical verifications/ falsifications, rather than to attempt to answer 'imponderable matters [questions].""Second, a religion is comprehensive in nature; it consists of a belief-system as opposed to an isolated teaching.""There is no established ""belief-system"" presented as evidence of design.""Third, a religion often can be recognized by the presence of certain formal and external signs.""Here is the clincher, quoting from pg. 46:  ""The third part of the test concerns the ""'presence of certain formal and external signs.'""  The court provided a list of such signs, including liturgy, clergy, and observance of holidays.  Obviously, design theory has none of these - no sacred texts; no ordained ministers, priests, or religious teachers; no design theory liturgies; no design theory holidays; and no institutional structures like those of religious groups.""If these prongs properly define 'religion', then Judge Jones erred in his decision.  ""Implying"" a God, does not a religion make.  A designer, design team, or designers over vast time would not need to constitute the role of an overseer, or an entity that conforms to prevailing monotheistic religions.  An appellate court ruling can be cited as a basis for later rulings, and in this case, to more accurately define 'religion' as referenced in Lemon v. Kurtzman, but not properly defined in that decision.  I eagerly await a subsequent court ruling based in-part on the above, as well as other relevant facts, to put this nonesense to rest.  I feel that Tom Jefferson would agree.    http://www.arn.org/docs/dewolf/utah.pdf    "
1,"Let's just cut to the chase: ID does not perform any empirical and statistical verifications, at best they could perform statistical falsifications of a particular scientific hypothesis but even the simplest hypotheses are not easily captured in statistics and thus ID has found that most examples of supposedly 'designed' systems, cannot really be tested using ID methodology.So let's be upfront here about what ID really is: It's the argument that when we do not fully understand how something arose, that our default position should be 'designed' not 'we don't know'. Once we agree on this simple fact, we can see if the Judge's ruling had a solid foundation.First of all, the judge observed that the school board was strongly motivated by religious beliefs and the fact that they believed that ID presented a scientific hypothesis and thus a valid secular purpose, was their downfall when the Judge showed not only how ID is tightly linked to religious motivations (the Wedge) but also that as a science it lacked any content.It is sufficient to point out that ID, which claims that design is that which remains when we cannot explain something using natural processes of regularity or chance, must be either the empty set or the supernatural. I doubt that many ID proponent would argue for the empty set and thus what logically remains, and what is supported by the evidence, ID's 'designer (wink, wink)' is just an evolved concept, just like 'creationist' became 'cdesign proponentist' to 'design proponent'."

1," Creationism is not scientifically testable. - The creationist account is an explanation that is not based on empirical evidence. It is not, nor claimed to be by those that uphold it, dependent on evidence or consequences that are observable by the senses. The creationist account requires a belief founded on faith and is not a 'working hypothesis' testable using observation or experiment. 'Explanations that cannot be based on empirical evidence are not a part of science' – National Academy of Sciences, Science and Creationism [1] Furthermore, all scientific theories are necessarily unproven - that’s what ‘theory’ means. A hypothesis is an assumption that is not taken as ""truth"", but as speculation. Evidence is used to test a hypothesis with the goal of demonstrating that it is likely true or unlikely true. If the evidence demonstrates that a hypothesis is likely false, then it is scrapped, and a new hypothesis is formed. This is the strict process of the scientific method. Critics of creation argue that creationism takes the Genesis account (actually there are two Genesis accounts, in Gen 1.1-2.3 and Gen 2.4-3.24) as necessarily true in every particular, and then bends the historical evidence to fit that so-called ‘hypothesis’. Because creationism attempts to advance an unalterable hypothesis or doctrine, it does not follow the basic principles of science, which stem from doubt, hypothesizing, and re-hypothesizing on to accepted theory. Because creationism fails to follow this basic scientific, theoretical approach, logically it is argued that it should not be called a ""science"".
"
1,"---Okay, let’s start with how ID tries to infer design, namely by using the Design Inference. In order for something to be designed, it needs to be ‘specified’ and sufficiently ‘complex’. So what is really meant by these terms? Specification basically means that there exists an independent description of the event or system, and as Dembski points out in biology ‘specification’ is trivially met by function. So what about ‘complexity’? Unlike the more common meaning of the term, complexity in ID speak refers to something which cannot (yet) be explained by regularity and/or chance. When these requirements are met, a design inference is triggered. In other words, a design inference bascially states that something functional whose origin we do not (yet) understand and is thus specified and complex, is also ‘designed’. Or to use Del Ratzsch’s description: Design is the “set theoretic complement of the disjunction regularity-or-chance. “. This clearly qualifiies as an argument from ignorance, also known as a ‘gap argument’.So far so good, Intelligent Design is inferred based on our ignorance not because of what we know. So how do ID activists make the claim that ID is based on ‘positive evidence’? After all, it seems self evident that ID cannot make any predictions or that it is based on ‘positive evidence’. After all, without knowing the intentions or capabilities of the Designer, how can one make any predictions? Anything goes…---As to the scientific vacuity, Ryan Nichols states it best--Ryan Nichols--In my argument against Intelligent Design Theory I will not contend that it is not falsifiable or that it implies contradictions. I’ll argue that Intelligent Design Theory doesn’t imply anything at all, i.e. it has no content. By ‘content’ I refer to a body of determinate principles and propositions entailed by those principles. By ‘principle’ I refer to a proposition of central importance to the theory at issue. By ‘determinate principle’ I refer to a proposition of central importance to the theory at issue in which the extensions of its terms are clearly defined. I’ll evaluate the work of William Dembski because he specifies his methodology in detail, thinks Intelligent Design Theory is contentful and thinks Intelligent Design Theory (hereafter ‘IDT’) grounds an empirical research program. Later in the paper I assess a recent trend in which IDT is allegedly found a better home as a metascientific hypothesis, which serves as a paradigm that catalyzes research. I’ll conclude that, whether IDT is construed as a scientific or metascientific hypothesis, IDT lacks content.--Source: Ryan Nichols, ""Scientific content, testability, and the vacuity of intelligent design theory"", The American Catholic philosophical quarterly, 2003, vol. 77, no4, pp. 591-611From my contribution at     http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/05/post_17.html    "

1,"--Judge Jones--Although we have found that Defendants' conduct conveys a strong message of endorsement of the Board members' par ticular religious view, pursuant to the endorsement test, the better practice in this Circuit is for this Court to also evaluate the challenged conduct separately under the Lemon test.18 See Child Evangelism, 386 F.3d at 530-35; Modrovich, 385 F.3d at 406; Freethought, 334 F.3d at 261.As articulated by the Supreme Court, under the Lemon test, a government-sponsored message violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment if: (1) it does not have a secular purpose; (2) its principal or primary effect advances or inhibits religion; or (3) it creates an excessive entanglement of the government with religion. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13. As the Lemon test is disjunctive, either an improper purpose or an improper effect renders the ID Policy invalid under the Establishment Clause.19We will therefore consider whether (1) Defendants' primary purpose was to advance religion or (2) the ID Policy has the primary effect of promoting religion.--Timothy Sandefur discusses the response by Discovery Institute Fellows, pointing us to an essay by Peter Irons    http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/06/montana-law-rev.html        http://www.umt.edu/mlr/Irons    %20Response.pdf"
1,"From the above linked paper by Peter Irons, I quote the following--Peter IronsIn an undoubtedly unintentional slip, which they may well regret, the DI authors have effectively given away the store with their concession that under the Lemon test, “all that was necessary [for Judge Jones] to determine that an Establishment Clause violation had occurred was to find that the Dover school board members had predominantly religious motivations for enacting their ID policy.” To repeat, those religious motivations would have been irrelevant if ID was in fact a legitimate scientific alternative to Darwinian evolution. Thus, in my view, Judge Jones was required to raise and answer this question, based on the voluminous record before him, which his opinion lays out in some five thousand words.---In other words, in accepting the Lemon clause, the DI basically accepted that ID serves no valid secular purpose."

Indeed, many groups, such as the National Academy of Sciences, go so far as to deny the existence of any genuine scientific controversy about the issue.160 Nevertheless, teachers should be reassured that they have the right to expose their students to the problems as well as the appeal of Darwinian theory. Moreover, as the previous discussion demonstrates, school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution-and this includes the use of textbooks such as Of Pandas and People that present evidence for the theory of intelligent design.--Ironic isn't it ""Of Pandas and People"", of all books. Was that not the book which was at the center of stage in Dover?"
2,"Here is the response to Irons, which was also published in the Montana Law Review.REBUTTAL TO IRONS (footnotes left off)By David K. DeWolf, John G. West, and Casey LuskinWe wrote a serious critique of the Kitzmiller ruling. Rather than deal with the substance of our arguments, Peter Irons responds primarily with red herrings, personal attacks, and erroneous statements. With merely 1,000 words to rebut, we highlight merely some of the problems.1. Irons tries to refute intelligent design (ID) by smear and innuendo rather than substantive argument. Pro ID scholars have published more than a decade of scholarship in reputable academic books and journals about the empirical evidence supporting design. Instead of engaging this scholarship, Irons wildly misrepresents a few blog posts and an old fundraising proposal, and uses guilt-by-association to insinuate (falsely) that Discovery Institute (DI) is run by “biblical creationist[s]” and supports “Biblical Reconstructionis[m]” and theocracy. Irons devotes pages to caricaturing the backgrounds, beliefs, and political affiliations of ID proponents, rather obviously trying to present ID as part of a nefarious conspiracy of the “Religious Right.” This is an example of what historian Richard Hofstadter called “The Paranoid Style in American Politics.”7 Irons tries to avoid debating the real issues by poisoning the well. 2. Irons misrepresents our critique of Judge Jones. Given his article, it is surprising that Irons accuses us of making ad hominem attacks against Judge Jones.8 Ad hominem arguments attack a person rather than that person’s position.9 Our article assesses Judge Jones’s analysis in light of his judicial responsibilities, but Irons’s rebuttal starts with the alleged motives and personal failings of the authors. Irons’s claim that we resort to ad hominem attacks is the height of irony.3. Irons misapplies the Lemon test. In a rare attempt to rebut our legal arguments, Irons claims Judge Jones properly determined whether ID is science because otherwise the Dover school board’s “religious motivations would have been irrelevant.” This is wrong: the Supreme Court requires the proffered secular purpose “be sincere and not a sham” and “[i]f the law was enacted for the purpose of endorsing religion, no consideration of [Lemon’s] second or third criteria is necessary.” Had Judge Jones found that ID is science, Dover’s policy would still be unconstitutional if adopted for predominately religious reasons. But Judge Jones found Dover’s proffered secular purpose was a sham, negating any need to address whether ID is science. As we noted, even anti-ID legal scholar Jay Wexler agrees Judge Jones was mistaken to rule on ID’s scientific status.4. Rewriting the history of DI’s involvement with Dover. DI opposed Dover’s policy at every stage of the process, and Irons’s contrary suggestions are false. The DI’s position in Dover was consistent with its publicly stated science education policy, and with its recommendations in Ohio in 2002 and 2004, and in Wisconsin in 2004, where DI also opposed mandates of ID. Irons’s only source for rewriting history is a statement of a Dover board member whom Judge Jones said “testified inconsistently, or lied outright under oath” and is therefore “not credible.”"
2,"--PvM--| I am sure that Highlander is familiar with the | foundational works of Behe and Dembski, | both rely on the absence of science being | able to explain a particular feature to infer 'design'.Would that a citation exist to back this one up!  I am familiar with their works.  Not familiar with that argument, though.  I think PvM may be conflating 'science' with 'evidence supporting materialist assumptions'.   The above statement is true with this substitution.--PvM--| That is incorrect as well, in fact in ID speak, | complex means 'lacking scientific explanations', | nothing more, nothing less. From this, ID conflates | the meaning of complexity with what one has | come to understand as complexity in science, | which is not the same as how ID 'defines' it.Again, a citation would be nice.  I don't expect them considering PvM's continued conflation of 'science' with 'evidence supporting materialist assumptions'. ID does say that complexity alone isn't a sign of intelligence, but irreducible complexity is.  The criteria have been revised over the years to clarify, but the core idea is sound: A complex system with inter-dependent parts has a much higher probabilistic hurdle for spontaneous unguided assembly.   A simple analogy is the game ""Mouse Trap"" - if all the parts aren't in the right place, the metal ball won't reach the trigger to drop the plastic net. PvM is also confirming the falsifiability of ID with this statement.  ID proponents do say an empirical demonstration (evidence supporting materialist assumptions) of an unguided process producing such interdependent systems, while retaining over-all reproductive ability, would falsify the design inference.  Human technology, a result of intelligence, is chock full of irreducibly complex systems.  It is therefore not unreasonable to infer intelligence in biological systems absent evidence supporting materialist assumptions.--PvM--| Highlander asserts that ID calculates the probability | that something was designed by chance and then | concludes 'design'. While this description only | superficially matches the design inference, it shows | the gap filling of ""not chance thus design"", nothing | more, nothing less. Of course, ID has not done any | non trivial calculations of probabilities and worse, it | does not have to reject chance alone, which is often | the simplest and still intractable calculation, but it | also has to exclude regularity pathways. And yet, | ask yourself, what calculations exist for the | bacterial flagellum or any non trivial biological system?Dembski wrote a book and has a website and several papers detailing the scope of input points and explaining how and why statistical probabilities are used and calculated.  In real life they are used to distinguish/derive (designed) signals from (random) noise.PvM seems unaware randomness and design are mutually exclusive concepts.  I understand 'chance' as shorthand for that which happens as a result of unguided (random) interaction of matter according to human understanding of forces and material chemistry.  'Organized' means ordered with intent and implies intelligence   Human tech. varies in level of organizational complexity, but is wholly caused by intelligent action upon matter.  This organization (design) is inferred because the arrangement of such matter defies explanation appealing to chance.The calculations on flagellum are irrelevant, but can be derived given accurate input points - how many of each different proteins are needed?  Which components are required for it to function as needed - (ie, if the cell needs to move to survive, what functional parts are needed), how many nucleotides are needed to code the RNA template of each protein?  And so on...  The lack of evidence supporting materialist assumptions complexity is a chance arrangement means the opposite could be true.  That many of these systems look designed and that science has not (even remotely) demonstrated a chance pathway to such organization, leaves design as the logical alternative.  Until proven otherwise."
2,"PT. 25. Irons defends Judge Jones’s double standard on motives. According to Irons, Judge Jones rightly scrutinized the religious beliefs of ID theorists while ignoring those of Darwinists, asserting that atheism naturally “follow[s]” from evolution, whereas religion motivates ID.  This is empirically false,22 and stands the First Amendment on its head: can Irons seriously claim that the First Amendment requires discriminatory treatment toward scientists because of their religious beliefs?  By arguing that Richard Dawkins’s atheism “followed”  from evolution, Irons concedes that metaphysical implications of a scientific theory cannot render it unscientific.6. Irons repeatedly misrepresents and misstates facts. Irons’s factual errors are too numerous to catalog, but we highlight some of the most egregious: Irons incorrectly conflates ID proponents with “biblical creationists.”  He wrongly implies that ID must reject common ancestry.  He accuses Michael Behe of failing to repair a purported “defect” in irreducible complexity, without revealing that Behe has responded to this objection.  He claims the John Templeton Foundation (JTF) asked ID proponents for research proposals which “never came in,” but JTF’s vice president denies that such a request was ever made, calling the episode a “media narrative manufacture.”  Irons alleges we “hijacked” Stephen Jay Gould, but Gould plainly agreed with Niles Eldridge that “the higher up the Linnaean hierarchy you look, the fewer transitional forms there seem to be.”  Irons insinuates that “not one” of DI’s fellows in the Center for Science and Culture has expertise in paleontology, ignoring the various ID proponents who have studied (or published) in mainstream paleontology circles, including on hominid evolution.  He claims “no ‘intelligent’ force can be observed or measured by any scientific process,” yet we explained that scientists study intelligence by observing humans and seek to detect intelligent action in SETI (“search for extraterrestrial intelligence”) programs. Irons uses poor sources for many of his claims, which may be why he is so inaccurate.Irons repeatedly falsely insinuates that we misrepresent quotations through omissions, but he misrepresents through creative quoting himself. For example, Irons claims William Dembski takes the position that “I am a Christian, therefore I reject evolution,” but ignores Dembski’s actual position: “Intelligent design . . . has no prior religious commitments and interprets the data of science on generally accepted scientific principles.”  It is Irons who has attempted to “swift-boat” the character of ID proponents through selective citations.Rather than refuting our substantive arguments, Irons attempts to divert attention away from the Kitzmiller ruling and its weaknesses. We trust that fair-minded readers will see through such tactics. If this is the best defenders of Kitzmiller can muster, the shelf-life of the ruling may be short indeed."

Why else would the DI argue so strongly that ID has valid secular purpose?Otherwise, given the religious motivations of ID, ID would never stand a chance in court."

1,"Here is Irons' response to the so called 'rebuttal'--Reply to RebuttalBy Peter IronsThe pages of a respected law review are rarely filled with such pejorative terms as ""smear and innuendo,"" ""poisoning the well,"" and ""personal attacks."" These are charges the DI authors have leveled at me in their Rebuttal to my article, in which I documented their ad hominem attacks on Judge Jones for his allegedly ""sloppy"" and ""biased"" Kitzmiller opinion. Although this reply to the Rebuttal is not part of the exchange in the Montana Law Review, it seems fair that readers of those articles might benefit from a brief rejoinder to the Rebuttal, which I will not burden with footnotes. I have numbered the points below simply for convenience.1. The DI authors fault me for not ""engaging th[e] scholarship"" they cite as providing ""empirical evidence supporting [intelligent] design."" My article was not directed at a detailed critique of this alleged scholarship, which lies outside both my fields of expertise and those of the DI authors. I did, however, note in my article the concession of Michael Behe at the Kitzmiller trial that he could not cite any ""pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred."" I thus had no ID scholarship to engage.===It only gets better    http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2007/06/irons_responds_to_west_luskin.php    The most relevant to this discussion is--Peter Irons--7. Moving to the legal issues in the Kitzmiller opinion, which the DI authors accuse me of slighting in my article, let me comment on their claim that both Judge Jones and I have ""misapplie[d] the Lemon test."" First, they concede that the ""proffered secular purpose"" of the Dover school board's ID policy was a ""sham"" and that Judge Jones properly held it unconstitutional as an endorsement of religion. Second, they argue that this finding ""negat[ed] any need to address whether ID is science."" On this point, the DI authors note that ""even anti-ID legal scholar Jay Wexler [a professor at Boston University Law School] agrees Judge Jones was mistaken to rule on ID's scientific status,"" citing Wexler's recent article in the First Amendment Law Review (Vol. 5, 2006). Without rehashing the discussion of this issue in my article, let me simply note that Professor Wexler and I disagree. Readers of this exchange are encouraged to consult the lengthy, and--in my view--persuasive reply to Wexler by Richard Katskee in that same issue of the First Amendment Law Review.--Richard Katskee, ""Why It Mattered to Dover that Intelligent Design Isn't Science"" First Amendment Law Review, Vol. 5, Winter 2006"

Further, Richard Dawkins stated that it is more probable that aliens created life on Earth than God.  I guess the AUSCS thinks Dawkins is a fool."

2,"Just what if there is a Creator?  Isn't science after truth?  Has science proven that there is no Creator? Why is recognizing the possibility that there was intelligence behind the emergence of life a non-scientific idea?  Basically what you are saying is that if there was a Creator or intelligence behind the emergence of life, science will never be able to come up with the right answer, right?So your whole premise for ID being non-scientific is the unproven worldview of naturalism?You start off right from the get go with the assumption that there is no Creator or any intelligence involved in the emergence of life and go and try and prove your idea with science.If you want to limit science to working within the little box of naturalism, fine, but then, you have to admit that you might be wrong from the start.  I think that is what ID is trying to show us.  They simply want to show that there is good scientific evidence for considering the role of intelligence in the emergence of life.  Does that fit with naturalism?  No, but since when must scientists bow the knee to naturalism to do good science?Many great scientists of the past did not bow the knee to Naturalism and yet we revere them today for their amazing achievements.  Looking for design in nature is a great way to do science.  Naturalists have no way to explain the amazing desing we see in Nature.  Their philosophy would not predict order and design, yet that is exactly what we find.  If you have the faith to believe in millions of naturalistic miracles of chance, great.  I admire your faith.

1,"--Highlander--PvM seems unaware randomness and design are mutually exclusive concepts.---Pray tell given that I have shown you how ID defines design to be the set theoretic complement of the disjunction regularity-or-chance. Or perhaps I should translate this somewhat technical phrase? Let me attempt to explain. Design is the compliment (mutually exclusive) of regularity-or-chance explanations. Of course, this is wrong in the sense that it may ignore the fact that randomness can in fact be an attribute of a designer and of course, the simplistic statement that randomness and design are mutually exclusive only captures part of the ID argument.By focusing on pure chance, Highlander has shown that he does not understand the ID argument and has highlighted one of the major problems for ID, namely that regularity and chance can explain information and complexity quite well.Until we clarify the terminology, highlander's arguments seem irrelevant at best as they argue a strawman version of reality.When asked for examples, Highlander remains without any, exemplifying once again the scientific vacuity of Intelligent Design. Why, if design depends so strongly on this step, are ID proponents unable to calculate any relevant measure of probability for said supposedly 'designed' systems?That's the $1M dollar question.

The ONLY way to label Intelligent Design ""religious"" is to change the definition of religion.And BTW, Albert Einstein once said ""Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.""Why do the anti-IDists insist on lame science?As for scientific evidence for ID start with the genetic code.

2,As you have been told already what Phil says is irrelevant to ID. Or you have to allow what Dawkins says about the theory of evolution.What part of that don't you understand?And it is a fact that if you could support your position with real data ID would go away.You can whine all you want but that will not change that fact.
1,"I guess this means that what ID proponents say about ID, is irrelevant even though said proponents are the ones who started ID?Fascinating indeed. But contrary to your claims, what Phil says and said was incredibly relevant in establishing the creationist roots and foundations of ID, which combined with its lack of scientific content, dooms it to irrelevancyID will never go away, we have already seen how it just moves its goalposts, all the way to front loaded design.What has ID done again for our understanding of the bacterial flagella Joe? Why is it so hard to address this simple question Joe?"
1,"--As for scientific evidence for ID start with the genetic code. The day we observe nature, operating freely, putting together a code is the day that MicroSoft will lay off all their programmers because they are unecessary.--Please tell us how does ID explain the genetic code, and I am sure you can explain to us the various hypotheses and the evidence as to how science explains it.But you have made a clear case that ID is all about ignorance, your 'bottom line' betrays' you.So surprise me, explain to us how ID explains the genetic code. And lacking that, show that you understand today's best explanations and admit that ID is not an inference to best explanation.Looking forward to your reply.As to your evolution is atheistic by the same logic, you are missing two important points. One, ID is not scientifically fruitful, two, ID was 'created' to get God inside the class rooms. With such a history, it is not hard to understand why people correctly have come to realize ID is at best a poor theology."

1,"--ID explains the genetic code the same way we explain a computer code.--Poof?... And thus, lacking a real response, Joe moves the goalposts back to science to show how it explains the genetic code. Let's thus explore why ID once again remains scientifically vacuous. All it can do is 'it looks designed', 'science cannot explain it'But science has indeed explanations for how the genetic code arose, and although there are still many gaps, science has uncovered many new features to support its hypotheses. Let me know when you have located the compiler. ID once again has been shown to remain unable to propose any competing hypothesis which explains the data better than science.As to ID not being invented to get God into anything, I guess you are calling your own ID proponents to be dishonest? Wow...Sure, appeal to the supernatural is areligious.ROTFL, next time you defend ID in court... Behe and Fuller already were to honest to admit that it is really all about the supernatural."
2,"Naming two well known ID proponents does not a citation make to support PvM's twisted version of ID arguments.  I've asked for them repeatedly and he's dodging.  What PvM still fails to understand is that probability is a measure of random outcomes.  It cannot 'prove' design because it isn't a measure of agency.  Probability tells us how often to expect a certain arrangement of a given number of items within the whole set of items.  We expect fellow poker players to get flushes and straights and even straight flushes.  We know a royal flush is possible but not very probable so we might naturally suspect a fix on the deal if several royal flushes were dealt in an evening of cards.  Extend that to a running game over many days and we are less suspicious.  Why?  Because of all possible arrangements of hands, a royal flush is the least probable and very unlikely to be repeated in a limited number of deals.  A deck of cards is cut before dealing as a check on intentional sorting.So we could go through all the permutations of flagellar components, the number and arrangement of proteins, the nucleotides needed to code them and so on, but why?  If we stumbled upon a starter motor in the middle of a remote Amazonian jungle, our experience would immediately eliminate it as a product of environmental selection.  The exact same is true when modern science reveals an IC structure such as the flagellar motor & assembly.  The absence of a plausible natural pathway means the design inference is valid.  The appearance of such a pathway would falsify design.I have not focused on pure chance, either.  Regularity and chance can explain re-arrangement of existing systems, but I would (again) request PvM produce citations to support his central claim that specified information is an emergent property of matter. That I do not address other aspects of the ID argument doesn't mean I've I excluded them.  I'm  just addressing the simple core of ID:  Design eliminates chance as a cause.  Initial biological systems formed by chance collision of the right stuff in the right environment at the right time, growing more and more complex either happened or did not.If the question is whether some arrangement of matter is random or designed, then assuming chance fills the gap beforehand is classic question begging.  PvM's circular proof therefore doesn't stand.  His allusions to facts to which he offers no support, other than the force of his assertion 'regularity and chance can explain information and complexity quite well', stand wholly unsupported.Okay PvM.  Support that last one.  Cite the literature which demonstrates how information and complexity are easily explained by regularity and chance.  That would falsify a central proposition of ID.  Since you said it would be easy, I eagerly await the citation. "
1,"--Joe GNow you are just lying. I have stated that ID relies on our experience, which means it does NOT rely on our ignorance.--What experience do we have with bacterial flagella and the genetic code? Other than that there is a superficial similarity with outboard engines and 'computer code'. Claims of positive experience when inferring design may be valid with ordinary design, which is how real science infers design and agency, but said method is woefully flawed when it comes to 'rarefied' design for which we have no experience.Now, there is nothing wrong with using the concept of design with formulating hypotheses. After all, the heart was historically seen as a pump, leading science to proceed in a fruitful area. But here we should not conflate the usefulness with a scientific necessity or relevance. "
1,"--Einstein""It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."" ~ Albert Einstein, 1954, from Albert Einstein: The Human Side--Seems Einstein considers the structure of the world as revealed by science the 'religion'. It always helps to comprehend the context in which these quote mines were produced.After all in the same paper Joe quotes, Einstein also remarked--The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exist as an independent cause of natural events. To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with the natural events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot. But I am persuaded that such behaviour on the part of the representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. For a doctrine which is able to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress....--"
2,"I never said anything about Einstein's religious convictions. Not one word.ID is not about a personal God. ID does not require a God at all. ID does not require intervention.The quote stands:""Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.""""But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding.”- Albert EinsteinAnd seeing that PvM doesn't care about the truth why is he a scientist?"
1,"--And seeing that PvM doesn't care about the truth why is he a scientist?--On the contrary, I have been asking you several times now: How does ID explains the bacterial flagella. Joe is right in one aspect, given the path chosen by ID, it may very well point to natural designers after all. But why call it 'design' then? As the supernatural is really the only focus of its 'approach' of eliminating natural processes of regularity of chance. What remains is either the empty set, or our ignorance or the supernatural. To understand how Einstein used the word religion you need to understand his position, otherwise it is just quote mining."
1,"--Joe GI never said anything about Einstein's religious convictions. Not one word.--and yet Joe G also said--""Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.""--In order to understand this comment by Einstein, you have to understand Einstein's religious convictions lest one is merely interested in 'quote mining' but then why quote Einstein. Einstein's position is actually perpendicular to ID where Einstein says that the regularity of nature is the religious aspect of science. In other words, it renders ID meaningless as it proposes regularity not the absence thereof, which would trigger the 'design inference'.Contrary thus to Joe's words, he should have either considered Einstein's religious convictions when he quoted him or he should not have quote Einstein. To quote Einstein as if it add relevance and credibility to Joes argument is just 'mining'"

A recent information-theoretic (but intuitively evident) definition identifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores about its environment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in populations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolutionary transitions that increase complexity. We show that, because natural selection forces genomes to behave as a natural “Maxwell Demon,” within a fixed environment, genomic complexity is forced to increase.--Christoph Adami, Sequence complexity in Darwinian evolution, Complexity, Volume 8 ,  Issue 2,  Pages: 49 - 56 , 2002 --Abstract--Whether or not Darwinian evolution leads to an increase in complexity depends crucially on what we mean by the term. Physical complexity is a measure based on automata theory and information theory that turns out to be a simple and intuitive measure of the amount of information that an organism stores, in its genome, about the environment in which it evolves. It can be shown that the physical complexity of the genomes of clonal organisms must increase in evolution, if they occupy a single niche and if the environment does not change. This law of increasing complexity is a consequence of natural selection only and can be violated in co-evolving systems as well as at high mutation rates, in sexual populations, and in time-dependent landscapes. Yet, co-evolution, because it can be viewed as creating an increase in physical complexity across niches, is likely the agent of a global increase in complexity.--Richard E.

ID by itself may not be a religious argument, after all that was the point of calling it ID, to remove references to religion. However, the combined lack of any scientific relevance and the well established religious foundations of ID, have caused ID to be intricately linked to religion, by design."

Preventing this approach has nothing to do with censorship and everything to do with facts.I was taught Creationism (my education was at a private school, and the cloak of ID did not have to be used) extensively, and taught the same ""controversies"" appearing in Intelligent Design arguments and manuals. The result? A wasted private-school education and my having to pay in college for not having a good science education before I took a real biology class.Please review the definition of ""censorship."" The prevention of deceit is not censorship."

1,"--Highlander--The exact same is true when modern science reveals an IC structure such as the flagellar motor & assembly. The absence of a plausible natural pathway means the design inference is valid. The appearance of such a pathway would falsify design.--As long as we agree that 'design' is nothing more that the claim that 'science cannot explain a particular feature or system', however then it has little relevance to intelligent design(ers). The IC claim of the flagellum is a good example of flawed reasoning. First of all, it has been shown how at least in principle IC systems can evolve, of course ID is quick to restrict IC to systems which retain their ""original function"" and ""evolved by Darwinian processes"". In other words, IC is basically the much narrower claim that certain systems could not possibly have evolved by Darwinian processes while maintaining their original function.Of course, falsifying this would at best falsify the claim of ignorance, not really the concept of design as it is more commonly understood.Clever trick..."
1,"Is good science a 'liberal' theme? If you love true science, you must be a liberalYou are in good company but remember that good science, including evolutionary science knows no boundaries, Christians, republicans, democrats and independents all accept the facts of science, of course given the historical link between evangelicals and republicans we do observe a stronger lack of understanding of science amongst some who also happen to be republicans but do not confuse cause and effect here."
2,"The National Center for Science Education, does not, as its name implies, promote and support science education in the United States in a general sense. Instead, it is an organization that is the modern embodiment of the ""Darwin's Bulldog"" role that has been played by many people in groups since Darwin's hypothesis was published.NCSE does not address Michael Behe's arguments directly.  Instead, they take that position that intelligent design arguments are religiously motivated, and as such, should not be debated in the scientific realm, but in the political realm.In their second paragraph, NCSE presents a distorted definition of intelligent design. The definition that I prefer, which is available at the Discovery Institute's web-site states ""The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.""  There is no mention of the Christian God or any other God in this definition.  Michael Behe who is Catholic has said that the designer could very well be little green men, he doesn't know, and that identifying the designer is not the goal of ID theory and research.  In other words, this issue is a red herring.I question whether NCSE is qualified to participate in this debate. I don't think they abide by the rules of this forum, and I don't think they play fair when it comes to this topic.I can cite many examples of censorship and harrassment by this organization and its members. One that I recommend that readers look up is the story of Danny Phillips and the NCSE.In my opinion, there are many valid scientific arguments in favor of intelligent design and many that seriously challenge naturalistic evolution.  The NCSE has not interest in debating this topic on a level playing field. Instead they use ad-hominems and fear tactics to persuade you that ID proponents have a religious agenda.Is there credible scientific evidence that life was designed? Yes.Does life change over time?  Yes.How and why are the great questions of our time.  Lets have an open debate and discussion, free from groups like NCSE that don't want you to think about this."
1,"--Dave--Is there credible scientific evidence that life was designed? Yes.--ROTFL.As to the NCSE not wanting to discuss, somehow I see few ID proponents on this group and Behe seems to have ignored Matzke's excellent critiques. Seems that ID cannot stand the light of scrutiny.So present your best scientific argument in favor of ID. Let's see where this may lead."
2,"""As to the NCSE not wanting to discuss, somehow I see few ID proponents on this group and Behe seems to have ignored Matzke's excellent critiques."" With all due respect PvM, the debate didn't end with Matzke. Dembski's first criticism of his paper, ""Evolution in Brownian Space"" pointed out that the path basically involves parts popping out of nowhere and flying into the right order. No explanation is given to what genes had to change from the homologs he describes, he simply assumed that if a path can be imagined, then it must in fact be possible. This is what Matzke's path looks like:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdwTwNPyR9w  "
2,"Agreed that religious belief should not necessarily compel the rejection of well-established results from well-developed scientific fields.Disagree that evolution is such a field.  Too much interpretation, just so stories, falsified predictions, reading into the evidence, etc. Disagree that Intelligent design has no scientific merit.  Read the other side's answer to this attack.  Archeologists use various methods to determine design in things they find.  SETI faithful are looking for signs of intelligent design in space noise - stuff that can not be attributed to a natural source or explained by natural means.  ID scientists simply look at the scientific realities that we have come to learn about, a far cry from what Darwin knew, and they realize that scientifically speaking, these things cannot be explained by natural means.  To say they can is simply a statement of faith because the proof is not there.  Neither side is proven so both sides deserve a hearing.  Just because ID may not fit into the religion of most Darwinites or the worldview of the Naturalists, doesn't mean that it does not deserve a hearing. We are after truth not the validation of a certain world view whether it is right or wrong just to satisfy the intelligentsia whose pride would be hurt if they were shown to be wrong.AGREE that ""This religious idea should not be imposed on public school science classes.""HOWEVER, there is no reason whatsoever that there cannot be fair debate about it. There is no reason that both sides of the issue can not be talked about in class.  There is no reason to disallow all views but ones that fit within the beloved worldview of naturalism.  Science is after truth and should be willing to look at the evidence, whatever that may be.  And let's just say for sake of argument that there is a Creator.   So if there is some kind of intelligence behind earthly life, and again, no one has disproven this as a possibility, then it would seem that the theory of evolution (where everything evolved by random chance with no goal or purpose in mind) would not stand up to the evidence.  It would seem that a scientific and honest look at the evidence would point out the problems.  What is the harm of at least exploring this possibility since even Dawkins admits that he would be open to the possibility of the involvement of space aliens here?  WE JUST DON'T KNOW so it would seen that even the Darwinites would want to investigate this idea, unless of course they are afraid of losing their faith in Pope Charlie.Who the designer is has nothing to do with it and everyone knows that.  This complaint that ID is religious simply because it claims there is intelligence involved in the origin of life and therefore unscientific is a smoke screen to keep this idea from being taken seriously by people.  Scientists would rather ridicule it and use scaremonger tactics by screaming ""religion!""  rather than answer it's claims rationally, because there are no answers.Open debate is all we are asking for.  Even the Discovery Insititute does not want mandated teaching of ID in the classroom. "
1,"--TJ10--Open debate is all we are asking for. Even the Discovery Insititute does not want mandated teaching of ID in the classroom. ----They seem to have changed their minds on this issue, and now, rather than calling it teaching ID, they are using equal time, teaching the controversy and academic freedom as excuses to get ID introduced into classrooms. If it were an open debate that ID were interested in then the issue has long since been settled.No, it's is certainly not an open debate which would expose the fallacies of ID to a larger audience, which seems to be of interest to ID. In fact, have you noticed how few ID proponents seem to engage some significant critiques presented here by for instance Nick Matzke? And your reply also does not suggest that you are interested in a open discussion. Your rhetoric betrays you."
2,"Some places do seem more open to honest debate over evolution rather than just trying to brainwash kids.  But this is not true everywhere.  Science should not be about brainwashing, but about seeking for the truth and if it leads to areas that scientists do not like, then so be it.  Another way to put it is that the purpose of science is not to support naturalism, whether it be merely methodological or not, but to search out the truth. Because we all know the answer may lay outside of methodological naturalism.  You might be fishing in a pond where there is no fish. You need open debate to be able to consider all solutions to the problem, including ones that might not fit within a scientists beloved worldview.While no one is recommending mandatory teaching of ID, there is rational reason to censor it either, except that it does not fit within the methodological naturalism of evolutionists. But since that methodological naturalism is just an arbitrary thing and rather recent at that, and since it cannot be proven that the answer to the origin of life actually can be found through methodological naturalism, then there is no reason to limit the debate to that worldview.  Seems rather stupid to do that if one is really after the truth.  If we knew for sure that the truth can be found in that view, that is a different story, but the best thing that can be said now is that scientists believe they will solve it some day.  I guess both sides have faith, huh!"
1,"You are confusing MN, with is a methodology with a worldview again... Tsk tsk.Funny how you are repeating the ID talking points without really understanding its flaws. ID is not being censored, but since ID has failed to be scientifically relevant, it still has to earn itself to be heard in the sciences and since our schools have a duty to teach good science, ID would be rejected based on that logic alone, lest you want any and all kind of doubtful science be taught in schools. Worse, in the case of ID is its strong foundation in Christian faith which combined with its failure to be scientifically relevant, has doomed it to remain constitutionally suspect.This is not about honest debates, or brainwashing. But I understand that these form much of the foundation for ID proponent's fear of that which they do not understand. And the confusion created by ID proponents like Johnson, who argued somewhat 'foolishly' that science uses philosophical naturalism, have spread a level of fear that seems to have clouded ID proponents into actually believing not only that science is atheistic, but worse, that ID provides a solution. Perhaps as a theology yes, although it raises some significant questions here too. But as a science ID simply provides no solution.If ID wants to play in the 'sciences' then should it not be held to a standard of scientific relevance? Or is this an 'anything goes' and we will soon be teaching astrology (per Behe) in schools as well, or the other side of the story of the Holocaust? Where does it end?"

That you capitalize the term demonstrates your veneration for it, and quite simply demonstrates why this is an argument between religion.Additionally, if this is not a fight about a creator, then why is this even worthy of discussion.  ID has never made a falsifiable prediction about biology that has been borne out experimentally and has never shown any scientific use.  Scientific thought abandons theories and notions that are not buttressed by data or logic; ID has never withstood such scrutiny.  That you continue to argue for it in spite of this shows that you have some other agenda.Regarding the rest of your post, it perpetuates the outright lie that what is not currently explained by Darwinian principles and modern biochemistry should induce the same skepticism as the glaring lack of evidence in favor of an outside creator.  At the most simple and basic level, Darwinian biology is based upon the principle that favorable inheritable traits tend to increase in frequency in a population.  Everything else (the rise of life from a primordial goo, the development of men and chimpanzees from a common ancestor, etc.) is based upon this principle and our observations of nature, living or otherwise.  This principle offers immense, and verifiable, predictive power.  Theories derived from this principle have been proven false, but not once has the basis of natural selection ever been shown to be in error.Alternately, at the most simple and basic level, ID is based upon the principle that an outside creator has shaped the course of nature's development.  This argument offers no predictions about the development or characteristics of life.  Moreover, it fails the basic scientific smell test of being falsifiable.  ID can only be declared scientific if the most basic principles of scientific inquiry are mocked.  "

Of course, a Creator does seems to me to be the most likely answer to who the designer might be, but so what?  What does that matter?  Why does that invalidate ID as science?  It is not a scientific question.  Science cannot answer that subject so that is not a part of Intellectual Design theory.  That is not a subject for science class.  ID is simply about the evidence for design.  If there is a Designer, then it naturally follows that there should be evidence for design.  Atheists don’t like ID simply because of it’s implications.  You may not like those implications, but that does not make it unscientific. That’s all I have time to write right now.tj"
1,"--Highlander--""I am sure that Highlander is familiar with the  foundational works of Behe and Dembski,both rely on the absence of science being  able to explain a particular feature to infer 'design'.""Would that a citation exist to back this one up! --Sure, always ready to please the audience.William Demsbki.

In case of Behe, his biggest mistake is that he limits himself to only Darwinian processes and the concept of original function.So let me explain what the design inference is all about:The Explanatory FilterA good overview of the filter and its shortcomings can be found in Wilkins, John S, and Wesley R Elsberry. 2001. The advantages of theft over toil: the design inference and arguing from ignorance. Biology and Philosophy 16 (November):711-724.    http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/theftovertoil/theftovertoil.html    Basically the steps involve1. High probability then it was caused by a regularity2. Intermediate probability then it was caused by chance3. Small probability: either chance or design depending on the existence of a ""specification""Specification is a somewhat tricky concept but according to Dembski, function in biology would be a sufficient specification. Ironically, function is also the outcome of the process of natural selection and thus whether the low probability score was caused by our ignorance or because of design is why the design inference remains without content, in case of rarefied design.Rarefied design: Rarefied design inferences tell us nothing that can be inductively generalized.The authors observe ""There is an in-principle difference between rarefied and ordinary design inferences, based on the background knowledge available about ordinary, but not rarefied, design agencies.""This is an important observation because it helps us understand why historical sciences can accurately apply 'design inferences' while ID remains scientifically without content.

1,"After admitting that science is not atheistic, he now accuses atheists, scientists and Christians alike of not liking ID's implications when in fact, anyone should realize that these objections are firstmost about the lack of scientific content of ID and that the strong religious foundation of ID is only secondary to this.ID is invalidated as science by its lack of scientific relevance caused by their reliance on an eliminative approach to detect design, causing their 'design' inferences to be nothing more than a position of 'we don't know' without providing any secondary information as to why their 'explanation' is better than 'we don't know'. Calling it an inference to the best explanation does not make it so. It's all smoke and mirrors.PS: Since Newton invoked the necessity of a God to explain the stable orbits of planets and since science showed this to be unnecessary later, does this mean that God has been disproven? No, at best one could say that this showed a foolish ignorance causing Newton to invoke an 'explanation' that explains nothing. "

Not only is that theory egocentric, it's not backed by the evidence.

That many of these systems look designed and that science has not (even remotely) demonstrated a chance pathway to such organization, leaves design as the logical alternative. Until proven otherwise.--Design always has remained a logical possibility however, ID does nothing to actually demonstrate that such a possibility is actuated. In fact, there is plausible and growing evidence that complexity and information increase are inevitable outcomes of evolutionary processes and while science may remain ignorant about the exact origin and evolution of systems, this does not give ANY credibility to the 'design' arguments, lest we define design to be 'that which science does not yet understand'.

2,"When I read Casey Luskin's article he made some very good points.  I am sure you read the article so I won't cut and paste them here.  My problem is that instead of addressing the points he made in his article those who find no merit in ID attack the writer personally or talk about the weight of scientific opinion against him.  Neither argument is scientific in itself.  It seems to me that Luskin is being ""more scientific"" in that he talks about a method for testing ID. Though you disagree with the validity of his argument, you don't address it.  That's my point.  May I make another point about what ""scientific"" is?  When Crick said molecular machines appear designed but are not, he was never castigated for being ""unscientific.""  If some responds and say those moleculare machines are designed, they are harshly criticized for being ""unscientific.""  Why?"
1,"-- It seems to me that Luskin is being ""more scientific"" in that he talks about a method for testing ID--That's ironic because Luskin presents no testable ID. Although I understand your confusion where ID claims that showing that a gap in our ignorance, which has been defined to be 'design', should count as a way to test 'ID'. But then ID is merely the negative argument that science cannot explain 'x' and has no relevance to what one commonly perceives ID to be, in other words, ID fails to place 'design' at risk.Perhaps you can tell me how you believe ID can be tested. Does this mean that since ID's flagellum has been shown to be plausibly evolved that somehow design and the designer have been falsified? Does the fact that regularity and chance processes, contrary to claims by ID proponents, can in fact increase information and complexity mean that ID has been falsified and that the 'designer is dead'? Of course not. At best it means that ID proponents were wrong in making their claims about science and since they never placed the concept of design at risk, ID remains scientifically without content.If you feel that I have missed other points worth addressing, please let me know. Realize that ID is very good at bait and switch, and that one need to carefully study its claims and arguments to be able to get to the core and come to realize that there is not much there.I am assuming you know how ID has defined the concepts of 'design' and 'information' and that they are at odds with how science typically defines such terms or how the layperson may interpret such terms?

Design fails to place ‘design’ at risk.  This is partially true.  If and when the arguments are answered, such as how DNA evolved, the flagellum, etc., then the ID argument becomes weaker and weaker, as it should.  The reverse should also be true.  Until that time many of it’s arguments seem to be the most reasonable inference based on the evidence as we understand it today. 4.  How can ID be tested?  Don’t know how we can test Cricks statement that molecular machines appear to be designed but are not.  Or that evolution is a process involving randomness and natural selection.  Has that been tested?  Still a good question and I believe Luskin has addressed that.  It was obviously not to your satisfaction but it looked okay to me.  What do you disagree with in that part of Luskin’s article?5.  You say it’s a fact that regularity and chance processes can increase information and complexity.  This may be true, but not to the order of magnitude required for a single protein, not to mention the information involved in DNA.  I’ve heard about the computer programs, pros and cons.6.  Not sure what you mean by bait and switch.7.  You last statement, I am assuming you know how ID has defined the concepts of 'design' and 'information' and that they are at odds with how science typically defines such terms or how the layperson may interpret such terms?   I am just not sure what you mean.  I’ve read about the specified complexity argument.  Not sure what you mean by at odds with design.Finally, I just want to say that it appears to me that statements made against ID and their proponents -- made by others, not you -- regarding ID has been so emotionally charged it makes me feel their judgment is affected.  It seems that it’s a very powerful argument to say if something appears designed, it may be because it is designed.  Some make the statement it may appear designed but it is not.  If that is so, where’s the proof?  "
1,"--Jim---1. You never responded to my comment: When Crick said molecular machines appear designed but are not, he was never castigated for being ""unscientific."" If some one responds and says those molecular machines are designed, they are harshly criticized for being ""unscientific."" Why?---Likely because when Crick said it, he had positive hypotheses about how such molecular machines had arisen. And indeed, looking at the genetic evidence it shows, as expected a nested hierarchy. When people say that it looks 'designed' and is 'designed' none of these people presents anything more that just that statement. And for good reasons because ID really cannot say more than that as it is based on an eliminative/negative argument.PS: I am not sure what Crick said when or where. I have tracked down one of Crick's statements to ID proponents' writings---""Biologists must constantly keep in mind that what they see was not designed, but rather evolved."" --Source: William A. Dembski ""Detecting Design in the Natural Sciences""The source of the original Crick claim appears to be """"What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery,"" [1988], Penguin Books: London, 1990, reprint, p.138"" and I will have to double check the context.--Jim---2. You write ID is merely a negative argument. I don't know about that (Luskin's article) but is it not normal in scientific discourse to point out the weakness of a theory and then argue against it on the failure to explain away the weakness?---this is what I call bait and switch or moving the goalposts. When pointing out that ID is vacuous, you state, but well, it keeps science honest. If that were the full extent of ID, then there seems to be no need to get ID pushed into are school curricula, nor would it really add anything to science as this is, as you point out what science already does. Things get worse however, when said 'arguments' against evolutionary theory are based on fallacious, misleading or outright false claims. So even in this aspect I have found ID to be lacking scientific relevance. The real issue of course is that ID proposes nothing beyond 'well science cannot explain 'x' yet'. So what... Why the attempt to call this 'design' and then use bait and switch to conflate the narrow definition of 'design' with how people commonly understand 'design'. That's too Rovian for me... If the full extent of ID is that it remains 'critical of science' then you would have to agree with me that this renders ID scientifically without content, as it fails to contribute any knowledge to science, other than point out that science does not yet explain 'x'. Look at the bacterial flagella for instance, what has science done to increase our understanding of the flagella versus what has ID done? I can tell you that science has increased our understanding significantly and has proposed, tentative hypotheses. What has ID done? Deny the relevance of the work of these scientists.to be continued"

If and when the arguments are answered, such as how DNA evolved, the flagellum, etc., then the ID argument becomes weaker and weaker, as it should. The reverse should also be true. Until that time many of it’s arguments seem to be the most reasonable inference based on the evidence as we understand it today.--But ID does not explain anything, it merely states 'designed' without anything else. In fact, as Dembski has argued, design does not necessarily necessitate an intelligent designer. How can ID's argument become any weaker when it cannot even compete with 'we don't know' which is a far more scientific default position when our ignorance does not allow us to propose anything relevant yet. Furthermore, unlike science, there is no way ID's position could be strengthened as ignorance nor the absence of an evolutionary explanation can be taken as evidence in favor of 'design'. Unless we define 'design' as 'that which we do not yet understand'. But why call it design then?"
1,"--Jim--Finally, I just want to say that it appears to me that statements made against ID and their proponents -- made by others, not you -- regarding ID has been so emotionally charged it makes me feel their judgment is affected. It seems that it’s a very powerful argument to say if something appears designed, it may be because it is designed. Some make the statement it may appear designed but it is not. If that is so, where’s the proof?--Just look at Darwin who showed how what previously had been seen as requiring design now suddenly did not necessitate design. In other words, while design in the larger sense can never be disproven since we can always propose a designer who used natural law, it can be shown that design is not a requirement or a necessary component.So we see the evidence strongly point to the fact of evolution (change over time, common ancestry) and thus there is strong evidence that suggests that design in these cases is apparent as it can be explained by processes of regularity and chance. However, we can also agree, that a God could very well have designed through these processes of regularity and chance, making design not a necessity but still a logical plausibility. Of course, there are variants which involve a God who created species at every single step and decided to make it appear to have evolved through natural processes of regularity and chance. That of course, requires one to propose motives and means for which we have no evidence.Sure, the arguments surrounding ID are emotionally loaded, mostly because of the strong religious overtones however my major concerns are not with the theological flaws of ID but rather how it is doomed to remain scientifically vacuous."
1,"Or that evolution is a process involving randomness and natural selection. Has that been tested?--For the purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are not challenging randomness in the statistical sense.In the most strict sense, evolution is the change of allele frequencies in a population over time.  Natural selection is the scientific principle that favorable inherited traits (alleles) become more common in populations over time.  I have only been skimming these posts, so I am not certain how much of Darwinian biology you agree with, such as basic population genetics principles or biochemistry.  Assuming you do agree with most of it and are solely arguing about the ontological facets of it, then above question is quickly answered.  If you have a neutral trait (i.e. one with no demonstrable effect upon evolutionary fitness) then the frequency of alleles in a population will fluctuate in a random manner.  Now, using this as a baseline, testing natural selection is quite simple.  Say the aforementioned alleles exists a population of yeast cells.  These alleles all currently code for proteins that do nothing.  These proteins catalyze no reactions, they provide no structural support, they merely exist and the cells transcriptional and translation machinery pumps out a useless protein.  Now, a point mutation arises in one of the alleles and the protein encoded by that allele can now digest a certain disaccharide which we will call A.  Prior to this there was no other allele at any location on any other chromosome in any of the yeast cells in the population that coded for an enzyme which could catalyze A.  At this point you could test natural selection (that favorable inherited traits become more common over time) by observing the change in allele frequencies after the yeast cells are plated upon a culture where A is the only type of molecule available for cellular energy.  Following plating, measure the change in allele frequencies.  If the frequencies change so that the A-digesting protein/allele is the only remaining allele, then natural selection as a concept clearly seems correct.  Keep repeating until you've made yourself happy that there is no other outcome."
1," Evolution is an observable fact - While creationists often attempt to describe evolution as merely a theory, this is not exactly the case. Observations that evolution does occur in nature makes the process of evolution fact. The only part of evolution that is ""theory"" is the explanation as to ""why"" it occurs. But the ""why"" has nothing to do with the simple fact that it does occur, a fact that leaves no room for creationism.

1,"---These two moves -ruling out regularity, and then ruling out chance -- constitute the design inference. The conception of design that emerges from the design inference is therefore __eliminative__, asserting of an event what it is not, not what it is. To attribute an event to design is to say that regularity and chance hav been ruled out....To be sure, design renders agency plausible. But as the negation of regularity and chance, design is a mode of explanation logically preliminary to agency.---p.19 The Design Inference--Because the design inference is eliminative, ther is no ""design hypothesis"" against which the relevant chance hypotheses compete, and which must then be compared within a Bayesian confirmation scheme.--p.62 The Design InferenceIn ""No Free Lunch"" Dembski attempts to show that the design inference, which is purely eliminative is not an argument from ignorance, as I have shown, his position is flawed. Others have done so as well, including Fitelson and Sober, Ryan Nichols, Pete Dunkelberg, Mark Perahk, Wesley Elsberry and John Wilkins.--Section 2.10 is of especial interest because it addresses the legitimacy of inferring design via an eliminative argument (the concern being that design inferences are arguments from ignorance--as we shall see, they are not).---p. 73 No Free LunchThe argument is one of induction, with all its problems namely that according to Dembski all instances in which we identified specified complexity and we know the causal history, intelligence was involved as well. In fact, Dembski claims that ""choice is the defining feature of intelligence and that specified complexity is how in fact we identify choice"".That final phrase dooms Intelligent Design since natural processes of natural selection also have 'choice' and thus such processes fall well within the realm of processes known to be able to generate specified complexity.--If the argument were purely eliminative, one might be justified in saying that the move from specified complexity to a designing intelligence is an argument from ignorance (i.1., not X therefore Y). --p. 111 No free  LunchBut the argument IS purely eliminative followed by an inductive argument which cannot exclude natural selection as a designer.Need more?"
1,"--Or that evolution is a process involving randomness and natural selection. Has that been tested?--Yes, in fact it has. First of all we need to understand the meaning of the term 'random' which just means that mutations do not arise in response to environmental needs. More on this later. This has been tested and so far no evidence has been found that seems to contradict this, although some data suggested that mutations did arise in response to needs. However, on closer scrutiny, science discovered the 'SOS response' where organisms enter a stage of hypermutations which combined with the new environmental pressures allows mutations which confer a benefit to quickly spread. As to natural selection, science has tested that natural selection is a real process and has measured many instances of it. This brings us to the final issue, is natural selection and variation the only mechanism of evolution? The answer is no, just like Darwin suggested, there are other processes, most notably 'random drift'."

2,"Let’s talk about Crick’s statement “Biologist must constantly keep in mind that what they see was not designed, but rather evolved.”  This is very important.  Crick may have a positive hypotheses  – but it is only a hypotheses.  He makes this statement as if it has been proven.  Yet many, including young students, accept this as fact as it sounds authoritive.   Big mistake.  ID reminds us not to make those assumptions.  Those assumptions are very important.  Those assumptions allow Dawkins to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.  The bottom line is some interpretations of evolution leave little room for a caring God.This is the view that life is the result of  random, purposeless arrangements of molecules shaped by natural selection.  Where does God come in?  Little or no room for God in this interpretation.  Hence if you believe that you can be an atheist.  If it is true you are almost certainly right in your belief.  But, what if that is not true?  And how do we go about determining if it’s true or not?  That’s where ID comes in.  It tells us from the facts as we understand them today, the most reasonable interpretation of these facts is that this molecular machine was intelligently designed.  You say ID cannot say more than that –if that is true– that still is huge.  It’s huge because your belief/unbelief in God is a primary world view, and will effect all your perceptions.  That’s what happened here.Example, Crick is an atheist.  He sees molecular machines that look designed.  He says God could not have done this because there is no God.  Therefor, these machines are not designed.   That is not good science.  He rules out design based on his world view, not on science.  He is encouraged to support his hypotheses through good science.  Not through bad theology.  As you say, ID is limited in what it can do, but what it does is of enormous importance.  It is very important to many around the world whether there is a God or not.  Darwinism is often used as scientific proof of no God.  Dawkins is only one of many scientist who do this.  They get upset when their world view is challenged.  I don’t believe science will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of a personal, caring God.  But that’s the point.  Right now many are using evolution as if it already has proven that God has nothing to do with our existence.  That has not been proven and ID reminds of us of that.  Jim"
1,"--The bottom line is some interpretations of evolution leave little room for a caring God.--Which I argue is the main reason people have come to embrace ID and object to science. And yet, when God was removed as a necessity from the stability of planetary orbits, noone objected.So Crick says that we must not confuse what we see with 'design' and proposes a valid, testable scientific hypothesis.

Jim--Science will never be able to do so and if you allow others to define this as if it has happened then you are granting these atheists a lot of power.

Where does God come in? Little or no room for God in this interpretation. Hence if you believe that you can be an atheist. If it is true you are almost certainly right in your belief.--Well, atheists have the advantage that they can incorporate science easily as it does not interfere with their philosophical position, but that does not mean that Christians cannot reconcile the fact of evolution, the mechanisms of evolution with the concept of a caring God. In other words, accepting evolution does not force you either way, although I agree that given the position of some Christians, science is in fact at odds with faith. That's too bad, but rather than throw up our arms and proclaim, science must be wrong because I cannot imagine how there is room for a loving God now that He is not a necessity anymore, shows, in my personal opinion, a severe lack of faith."

So it seems that you have a similar problem. Of course, ID is not rejected based on its theology which is in the minds of many, quite flawed, but rather on the lack of content scientifically speaking. A God who set it all in motion is quite compatible with science as is the position of atheism. Seems that we can find common ground here. Of course, the concept of design as formulated by ID hardly seems suitable to reach such a scientific conclusion, at best this seems to be a theological interpretation.

Again, the confusion of ID with archaeology is understandable but misleading as it suggests that is is how ID infers design. In fact, as I have shown, science's design inference are not based on ""we don't understand' thus designed. So what kind of design are you interested in? The kind science already successfully detects or the kind that seems to be doomed to remain elusive to science, also known as 'rarefied design' [1][1]See Wilkins and Elsbery The advantages of theft over toil: the design inference and arguing from ignorance.

1,"--But it's more than we don't understand' thus designed. It's specified complexity. Wherever we find specified complexity we find a designer. But for the theological implications this would be non-controversal.--That is yet another one of these ID claims which lack in much relevance. But for the sake of the reader, let's explore Jim's claim because otherwise the ID proponent may argue that I have not fully represented the ID argument.Specification is something that is, as is with so many aspects of ID, ill defined and even harder to measure but according to Dembski. first of all in biology, specification seems to be similar to 'function', which in evolution leads to an immediate problem namely that function is also an expected outcome of evolutionary processes.--Addressing the particular question regarding whether the bacterial flagellum is specified, Dembski confidently declares that, “Specification is never a problem. The irreducibly complex systems we consider, particularly in biology, always satisfy independently given functional requirements.... For instance, in the case of the bacterial flagellum, humans developed outboard rotary motors well before they figured out that the flagellum was such a machine.”NFL, p. 289.The flagellum functions like an outboard rotary motor. The rotary outboard motor pattern represents a functional requirement independent of biological systems. Therefore, concludes Dembski, the flagellum is specified. --Source: Hopward van Till, ""E. Coli at the No Free Lunchroom""    http://www.counterbalance.net/id-hvt/isthe2-body.html    In other words, in biology, the complexity part is established through our ignorance and the specification through function, so we can slightly revise our claim to state that in biology 'design' refers to science's ignorance about how a particular system with a function came around.Note that ID also does not provide any additional side hypotheses to explain from the ID perspective how such specification came about.In other words, outside biology, what is sufficient to identify some subjective function or pattern which is independent of the system and voila the foundation for a specification arises. Since we are very well aware of the fact that us humans are extremely capable of seeing 'design' in many aspects of life, it should not come as a surprise that under ID's approach the ""Old man in the mountain"" is as valid a design inference as Mount Rushmore, but of course likely to be wrong. Similarly, the patterns of circles or stable orbits combined with a lack of understanding of how science would explain this, caused Newton to infer 'design' for planetary orbits.Worse of course, the ID hypothesis does not only infer 'design' but provides no measures to show that its inference is more likely than 'we don't know', making the inference highly unreliable. And if we take Dembski's claim that if the design inference includes false positives, it would be useless, I am surprised why we are still talking about this."

I have heard their opponents over and over try to donflate ID with creationism.  I think this is deliberate.  This shows a weakness.

His latest book ""Edge of evolution"" shows how ID can only make its claims when ignoring scientific progress. Guillermo Gonzalez failed to impress his tenure committee that he should be given tenure. They promote ID, they get people to respond, and in most cases they totally ignore the criticism. Look at how Behe is ignoring the devastating observations by Matzke in this forum for instance. Of course, Behe has no duty to respond but it shows how ID fails to be able to really present its case or defend itself against real criticism. That ID has its roots in Christianity is just an additional bonus to help understand why despite its scientific vacuity, ID is still attempting to introduce it under the guise of, what is the flavor of today?, oh yes, academic freedom.You could perhaps move forward this discussion by explaining how ID explains any 'designed' system? What hypotheses relevant directly to design does it generate?I have seen various attempts by ID proponents to make claims of 'research programs' based on ID but ID lacks a foundation for that as well, I'd argue."

Look at intelligence and design where we can most likely identify it, It seems that in order to distinguish intelligence from ""dumb"" physical processes, one must first decide whether intelligence even exists in humans, and if so, what it is that distinguishes it from non-intelligence. Likewise for design. What characterizes or demonstrates premeditated intent from pure accident at the only level we can reliably distinguish it, the human level. As obvious as these questions sound, they are actually non-givens. Once that can be agreed upon, it would not be that hard (relatively speaking) to set up a prospective study with rapidly reproducing organisms showing detectable micro-evolution.

1,"F2XL insists that just because God is absent from the book that it therefor could not have been based on creationism, even though it defined creationism to be in line with its predecessors and later renamed the term to read design. The book defines creation/design in a manner totally consistent with how its predecessors defined it, but in those cases they were more upfront about the religious implications.As I have shown you, you avoid looking at the evidence by arbitrarily setting your requirements for what you would accept. It's the preponderance of evidence that shows the historical change of the book to coincide with the Edwards ruling in which it was found that the use of creationism was not valid as a scientific alternative and a more neutral descriptor was needed. ID matched this, and not the concept since it was just a global find and replace not a rewrite of the arguments. This thus linked ID to creation to its God filled predecessors. Surely you do understand the history behind creationism, which believed that by removing references to God, but still repeating the same old flawed arguments, that it would be constitutionally permissible to teach it in schools. Edwards showed them to be wrong, their response? Not rewriting the arguments but renaming the Creator to be a designer (wink wink) and still the same old misleading arguments.By making information immaterial, it all but admits that it is about the supernatural, by making Pandas to oppose the science of evolution which the FTE considers to be atheistic, Buell clearly admitted that the 'alternative' was what historically was presented as God the Designer."

1,"--I take it your also a closet fan of Hugh Ross am I right? ;D--Not really, he tries hard but fails. At least he seems to be more interested in getting the science right IIRC.As to the religious foundations, they were exposed during the trail. See Barbara Forrest, as well as Buell and the various expert witnesses for the defense leading the Judge to rule appropriately about the FTE and the nature of the book.All you have to offer is that the book was misunderstood.As the plaintiffs point out in their response brief to the DI and the FTE--Similarly, the FTE declines to address facts that it is best situated to explain. Numerous documents in evidence reveal FTE to be a religious organization with religious objectives, not a scientific one pursuing scientific aims. P12; P28; P168A; P566; P633; 10:90-92, 96-101 (Forrest). The FTE ignores all this evidence in its amicus brief.In a pre-trial hearing in this case, FTE president Jon Buell attributed religious descriptions of his organization, in legally required public filings he had signed, to mistakes by lawyers and accountants. The Court can decide whether Mr. Buell and the FTE were filing false documents with the federal government and the State of Texas, or whether they were instead misrepresenting themselves to this Court, by disowning the religious agenda stated in those documents. The overwhelming evidence from Mr. Buell’s own writings regarding his and FTE’s Christian, creationist objectives gives the Court ample basis to make that judgment. P12; P28; P168A; P566; P633; 10:90-92,96-101 (Forrest). Either way, the FTE’s submission is entitled to no credence or respect from this Court.This is particularly true of the FTE’s rationalization for the substitution of the phrase “intelligent design” for “creation” in versions of Pandas prepared after Edwards. FTE makes the impossibly silly argument that by discarding the words “creation” and “creationism” found in early drafts, the FTE expressly rejected creationism. FTE Brief at 17. The only way the drafting history of Pandas could be interpreted as rejecting creationism is if the authors had discarded not just the word, but the explanation of what the word means — “various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency with their distinctive features already intact — fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc.” The retention of the central creationist concepts using a different term, “intelligent design,” dictates only one inference: intelligent design equals creationism.If this were not true, surely the FTE would have provided an explanation in its brief for why Pandas was written by two admittedly creationist authors, one of whom was an advocate for creation science in the federal courts, and for why Buell thought that the Edwards ruling on creation science would matter so much to the financial success of Pandas. P350; 10: 102-104, 126-128 (Forrest). But there is no discussion of these facts.--Or Minnich --Q. Sir, is it your understanding that creationism requires an abrupt appearance of life on earth?A. Creationism, you know, scientific creationism, yeah, ex nihilo appearance of life forms.Q. Is this ex nihilo appearance of life forms, is that a theological concept?A. Yes, yes. Out of nothing.Q. Does this statement in Pandas that I just reviewed with you, does this make intelligent design creationism?A. No, I don't think so. I mean, this is a literal interpretation of the fossil record where you see the sudden appearance of these forms, you know, fish with fins, etc. in a geologic record. From my interpretation this isn't ex nihilo, you know, creation from nothing.--ROTFLRuling--Demonstrative charts introduced through Dr. Forrest show parallel arguments relating to the rejection of naturalism, evolution’s threat to culture and society, “abrupt appearance” implying divine creation, the exploitation of the same alleged gaps in the fossil record, the alleged inability of science to explain complex biological information like DNA, as well as the theme that proponents of each version of creationism merely aim to teach a scientific alternative to evolution to show its “strengths and weaknesses,” and to alert students to a supposed “controversy” in the scientific community. (10:140-48 (Forrest)). In addition, creationists made the same argument that the complexity of the bacterial flagellum supported creationism as Professors Behe and Minnich now make for ID. (P-853; P-845; 37:155-56 (Minnich)).--And then of all people Fuller, expert witness for the defense!!!--Moreover and as previously stated, there is hardly better evidence of ID’s relationship with creationism than an explicit statement by defense expert Fuller that ID is a form of creationism. (Fuller Dep. at 67, June 21, 2005) (indicated that ID is a modern view of creationism).--"

2,"""The term creation and creationists have very clear and religious meanings.""    http://www.fteonline.com/pandas-creationism.html   Check the actual context of those drafts.

1,"You argue, based on the FTE's claims that the term 'creation' and 'creationism' had nothing to do with religion. Now I understand why you want to rely on the DI and the FTE's claims but this means that you are shielded from the facts.As I said the term creation and creationism have clear meanings which help explain why the terms were quickly and abruptly changed after the Edwards ruling.Since you believe in design inferences, what inference is one but to make here.In addition you have fallen victim of the claim that just because the FTE was denied to be heard, that the argument was not heard. From the actual ruling--Judge JonesAs Plaintiffs meticulously and effectively presented to the Court, Pandas went through many drafts, several of which were completed prior to and some after the Supreme Court's decision in Edwards , which held that the Constitution forbids teaching creationism as science. By comparing the pre and post Edwards drafts of Pandas, three astonishing points emerge: (1) the definition for creation science in early drafts is identical to the definition of ID; (2) cognates of the word creation (creationism and creationist), which appeared approximately 150 times were deliberately and systematically replaced with the phrase ID; and (3) the changes occurred shortly after the Supreme Court held that creation science is religious and cannot be taught in public school science classes in Edwards. ***This word substitution is telling, significant, and reveals that a purposeful change of words was effected without any corresponding change in content, which directly refutes FTE's argument that by merely disregarding the words ""creation"" and ""creationism,"" FTE expressly rejected creationism in Pandas.*** In early pre-Edwards drafts of Pandas, the term ""creation"" was defined as ""various forms of life that began abruptly through an intelligent agency with their distinctive features intact – fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc,"" the very same way in which ID is defined in the subsequent published versions. (P-560 at 210; P-1 at 2-13; P-562 at 2-14, P-652 at 2-15; P-6 at 99-100; P-11 at 99-100; P-856.2.). This definition was described by many witnesses for both parties, notably including defense experts Minnich and Fuller, as ""special creation"" of kinds of animals, an inherently religious and creationist concept. (28:85-86  (Fuller); Minnich Dep. at 34, May 26, 2005; Trial Tr. vol. 1, Miller Test., 141-42, Sept. 26, 2005; 9:10 (Haught); Trial Tr. vol. 33, Bonsell Test., 54-56, Oct. 31, 2005). Professor Behe's assertion that this passage was merely a description of appearances in the fossil record is illogical and defies the weight of the evidence that the passage is a conclusion about how life began based upon an interpretation of the fossil record, which is reinforced by the content of drafts of Pandas.---In other words, the terms as defined clearly mirrored what we know as 'creationism' and that it was an inherently religious concept. Even the expert witnesses for the defense, Minnich and Fuller had to admit this. Behe attempted to 'explain' away the evidence but was ruled to be illogical and the weight of the evidence presented.Thus the court concluded based on the evidence presented that--The weight of the evidence clearly demonstrates, as noted, that the systemic change from ""creation"" to ""intelligent design"" occurred sometime in 1987, after the Supreme Court's important Edwards decision. This compelling evidence strongly supports Plaintiffs' assertion that ID is creationism re-labeled. Importantly, the objective observer, whether adult or child, would conclude from the fact that Pandas posits a master intellect that the intelligent designer is God.--Such is the danger of relying on a biased set of documents from the publishers of Pandas and the Discovery Institute. So let's see at what the book 'argues'--The book argues that the origin of new organisms is ""in an immaterial cause: in a blueprint, a plan, a pattern, devised by an intelligent agent.""--Clearly supernatural since common intelligent designers do not require immaterial causes. In addition, the objections to evolutionary theory mirror the same flawed criticisms of earlier religious opposition. So no wonder that reviewers such as Kevin Padian, a biologist at University of California Berkeley .. called it ""a wholesale distortion of modern biology.--Of PandasCreation means that the various forms of life began abruptly through the agency of an intelligent creator with their distinctive features already intact.

The answer is no, it doesn't. None of the three points Judges Jones and the ACLU make show that the early drafts specifically implicate god or the supernatural in Pandas. All it does show is that they wanted people to be aware they were writing about a completely different set of ideas then what creationists where aiming for in the late 80's.

Either creation is defined independently of the facts and then the data show support or we have a tautological statement. In fact, the statement above does not describe the facts and the denial of said facts, is a standard creationist position were 'God created according to kinds' and these 'kinds could not change'. Typical creationist ignorance portrayed as 'science'. No wonder, the abrupt appearance/creation is a standard religious explanation which ignores the facts of science. That thus creation became design shows that the concept of design is nothing more than a cover for creationism to hide under.The best some can do is to state that 'well, it does not mention God'...

1,"Luskins opines:""As I discussed in my rebuttals to the first two opening statements of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), some of their common debate tactics include:""Of course.  This ""debate"" is not a scientific debate.  The scientific questions were settled many decades ago.  This ""debate"" is a ""public relations"" debate, and the same tactics (and much worse) are used by you and the Discovery Institute to try to bamboozle the rubes into believing that your side actually has some logic or evidence on your side.Luskin tries to confuse the issue:""ID does not require appeals to the supernatural.""Maybe it only ""allows"" appeals to the supernatural?  Regardless, the rubes that send financial contributions to the Discovery Institute are 99% religious believers and they just assume that your so-called ""intelligent designer"" is their Christian God.Luskin continues:""ID merely seeks to infer ""intelligent causes""""Riiiiight.  And since all of your silly inferences have been shown to be illogical, it is clear that ID is anti-science nonsense.  Regardless, the rubes clearly understand that your ""intelligent cause"" is their Christian God.Luskin then quotes a really silly opinion:“If science is based upon experience, then science tells us the message encoded in DNA must have originated from an intelligent cause.""This is, of course, a completely unwarranted conclusion.  This is just an appeal to a selected authority, since I am sure that many scientists would reject this opinion.Then Luskin gets right down to admitting that ""intelligent design"" can never be science:""design theorists recognize that the nature, moral character and purposes of this intelligence lie beyond the competence of science and must be left to religion and philosophy""So, ""intelligent design"" postulates an ""intelligent cause"" than can never be a part of science.  If that's not supernatural, I have a few hats in my closet to munch on.Then Luskin admits that ""intelligent design"" could mean just about anything:""Possible candidates for the role of designer include: the God of Christianity; an angel--fallen or not; Plato's demi-urge; some mystical new age force; space aliens from Alpha Centauri; time travelers; or some utterly unknown intelligent being.""This is truly hilarious.  What is the purpose of the ""intelligent design"" movement?  They wish to specify that the Theory of Evolution could be wrong or incomplete because one of these ""designers"" might really be responsible?  No wonder a Federal judge found that teaching this nonsense in a public high school was not permitted.Luskin continues on and on and on with this nonsense:""there is no known scientific method for identifying the intelligent source responsible for design in nature""""for the scientific theory of ID to address the identity or metaphysical nature of the designer would be to inappropriately conflate science with religion.""Since there is not and cannot ever be a ""scientific theory of ID"", it is no wonder that there is no attempt to identify the designer.  A real scientific theory that inferred a designer would have to actually find evidence of the existence and purpose of such a designer.  ID can't be bothered, since it is clear that such a search might in fact admit that such a designer could be supernatural.  Round and round we go, never actually getting anywhere.  Luskin can rewrite the same old stuff for 5000 words, but it never actually means anything.The flagellum used to be an example of an ""irreducibly complex"" biological structure that could not evolve.  Now Luskin is reduced to ""may"":""may indicate that the flagellum arose by intelligent design""May?  ""Intelligent design"" MAY have some evidence?  Or maybe not.

The judge ruled ""It's not science"" and nothing that any of the ID ""scientists"" have ever done would lead to the conclusion that there was any possibility of actual science being involved with ""intelligent design"".Luskin quotes an attempt to avoid the supernatural:""Explanations that call on intelligent causes require no miracles but cannot be reduced to materialistic explanations.""This seems to me to be an obvious contradiction - ""cannot be reduced to materialistic explanations"" means ""no natural explanation"" and that means a ""supernatural explanation"".  Who are they trying to fool?  They didn't fool a federal judge!Finally we get to the fundamental question:""ID makes reliable inferences.""Well maybe Luskin wishes to assert that, but scientists say ""nonsense"".  How can ID convince scientists that the requirement of an ""intelligent cause"" is a ""reliable inference""?  They have tried and failed for more than 10 years.  Their attempt is:""Our experience-based knowledge of information-flow confirms that systems with large amounts of specified complexity (especially codes and languages) invariably originate from an intelligent source from a mind or personal agent.""Fundamentally, this is an appeal to our knowledge of human agency.  Humans are ""intelligent"".  Humans create ""complex information systems"".  Therefore life forms were created in some unspecified way by some unspecified entity at some unspecified time in the past by an ""intelligent designer"".  Well, evolution is a perfectly good explanation and the ""reliable inference"" of ""intelligent design"" is nonsense.Luskin attempts (for the 100th time) so convince skeptics that ID really really is scientific:""Scientists then perform experimental tests upon natural objects to determine if they contain complex and specified information.(24)""But skeptics reject this assertion for the 100th time by pointing out that ""complex and specified information"" is in the eye of the beholder and not properly defined so that it could be used by a scientist.  And ""irreducible complexity"" of a biological system is simply a false assertion.Luskin then provides one final false assertion:""ID has also provided new insights into biology""Well, 10000 scientists say that such ""insights"" were really ""distractions""."
1,"onein6billion observes that Luskins claim --""ID makes reliable inferences.""-- is flawed. In fact, as I have shown, ID's chosen approach makes very unreliable inferences. The cost of which is significant, since as Dembski has argued, if the filter allows ""false positives"", as it does, it would render the approach uselessThere you have it: Useless...Others, have shown that the lack of any positive arguments surrounding ID, do not allow ID to compete with the much more scientific position that ""we don't know"", and yet it insists on labeling our ignorance with the very unreliable inference of 'design'. Lovely..."

After all, the mutation rates needed to explain the differences between species are well within the range of observed mutation rates.I understand though why you want to move the discussion from ID, which explains nothing, to UcD and mechanisms. Show us either how ID explains UcD or how mutation rates need to be too high for UcD.Surprise us with some real science."
1,"It is not entirely clear to me who you are inditing for being rude, so I wont attempt to defend them.I would like to respond two points you raise:1) That it is preferable to have a super-natural design process to a natural design process. I'm afraid I can't understand where you are coming from. I really don't see what difference it makes as to what process is responsible for designing us, what the goals, preferences, or attributes of our designer are etc.Can something be wonderful because it is made by this person in this location at that time? Or is it wonderful because of some property the object possess in the present time? In other words, aren't people wonderful simply because they are people? I have never met a person and asked myself: Was this one created by God? Because if this person wasn't then they just aren't wonderful anymore. I only want intrinsic wondrousness, not some worthless extrinsic wondrousness. And on your second point: Yes,   evolution   is in every single biology text book, just like relativity is at the end of every single physics text book. I'd like to know what you would think if a teacher presented three views for our creation: Evolution, intelligent design, and malevolent design. Can I tell students that life was created to inflict suffering on other life? In all honesty, should I be ALLOWED to tell students that human beings are the creation of a malevolent entity? By simply presenting arguments to support this conclusion I would be forced to advocate some form of satanism. Less illustratively, teachers do not have freedom of speech when teaching children. I cannot go into school tomorrow and tell all the children in the class and express political opinions. I cannot go and express theological opinions. (Children: pray to Satan. I'm sure I won't get fired for telling you to do this...) Teachers simply do not have the same freedom to express their opinions in the class room as you have in a public forum. I know you believe that ID is excluded from scientific texts because of its religious connotations. You probably wont believe me but nothing could be further from the truth. ID is excluded from scientific text books simply because of its lack of scientific standing.

There is no scientific evidence that atheist students suffer mental health complications as a result of being exposed to Intelligent Design, nor evidence that their or their parent's ability to vote how they wish will be affected.  There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that harm is caused to anyone after repeated exposure to Intelligent Design.  The hypothesis that people's rights will be violated and/or harm will be caused is not supported in any peer-reviewed journals (and we all know that if it ain't in peer-reviewed journals, then it should not be believed)."

1,"that Luskin accuses the NCSE of rewriting history and law when both clearly established the evolution of creationists via cdesign proponentsists to ""design proponents"". The link between the ignorance of its predecessors is continued in ID via the work of such 'luminaries' as Jonathan Wells who repeats much of the same flawed arguments against evolutionary theory.Judge Jones was not fooled by the attempts to explain, after the fact, the obvious transition which coincided (design inference) with the Edwards ruling which ruled creationism to be unconstitutional. In an obvious attempt to shed any reference to God, delegating Him to an irrelevant role, ID has attempted to circumvent the rulings of law. And it has not worked, because ID is based on the same flawed arguments that doomed creationism (sudden appearance is still an essential component) and the argument is that ID cannot distinguish between the natural and the supernatural. However, real science can deal quite well with the natural but when it comes to the supernatural, design inferences have historically been unreliable.Look at the recent findings related to the bacterial flagellum which have totally undermined Behe's argument for design. Has Behe admitted that his inference for design was flawed? Has he admitted the impact of such falsification on ID? Of course not. It's best not to inform ID supporters of these inconvenient facts of science.If ID were all in favor of teaching the controversy, it seems reluctant to explain the controversy.As to twisting the law, Luskin's attempts to dismiss Judge Jones's ruling are self evident even though Luskin, who is a lawyer himself, should know better. Hearing Casey use the term revisionism in his own posting is just the pinnacle of irony.Never mind though, Luskin has managed to give away the playbook for the next season and I am sure the NCSE is looking forward to the next encounter. So far, they have quite a winning streak in supporting science."
1,"What's a ""Darwinist?"" Can someone who says that the other side is mishandling terms really afford to label someone as ""Darwinist?"" I neither worship Darwin nor accept his writings as absolute truth. ID, on the other hand, may be compatible with a wide range of faiths, but they don't seem terribly interested. The only proponents of ID I've ever spoken with are Christian. If there was the presence of an Intelligent Designer, who else would it matter to? Pantheists don't care; they already think the world's workings are in harmony according to overlapping plans. Agnostics are noncommittal about the designer, not the least because there's no proof of intelligent design. So all of those meet science without presuppositions and with respect for what is real.The Abrahamic religions center most strongly around a judgemental god. If there were not the idea of judgement, would the possibility of an intelligence with the power to create life even matter? It's only the idea that this is the god that humanity answers to that makes Christians push for the reality of ID's design and the idea that it should be proselytized."
1,"Luskin quotes:""May not the principle of uniformity then be used in a broader frame of consideration to suggest that DNA had an intelligent cause at the beginning?""This would seem to be the usual trick of ""origins science"" - an attempt to claim that abiogenesis is impossible.But another opinion is:""The book argues that the origin of new organisms is ""in an immaterial cause: in a blueprint, a plan, a pattern, devised by an intelligent agent.""""This refers to ""new organisms"" - that would mean new species, not abiogenesis.And:""creation means that various forms of life began abruptly""This is definitely anti-evolution creationism without specifying a creator explicitly.Then:In a new draft of Pandas, approximately 150 uses of the root word ""creation"", such as ""creationism"" and ""creationist"", were systematically changed to refer to intelligent design.  The definition remained essentially the same, with ""intelligent design"" substituted for ""creation"", and ""intelligent creator"" changed to ""intelligent agency"".So, the definition remained the same, only the nouns were changed.  I wonder why the judge ruled that this really was the same old creation story?""the basic arguments for design pre-date Christianity""Fine.  The philosophers didn't have a clue about evolution back then and you still don't have a clue today."
1,"Just because ID claims that it is scientifically relevant and in fact can lead to affect research directions, does not mean that their claims are accurate and truthful, especially given the simple fact that in the last 10-15 years, ID has failed to show much of any example that supports their claims. Their chosen method to infer design has remained vacuous scientifically and there is no compelling reason why ID, which has the right to speak, should deserve the right to be heard. "
1,"--It is entirely misleading to imply that ""Academic Freedom is gives license to Present Non-Science, like ID""These academic freedom bills, which typically work in conjunction with the science standards are written to strictly prohibit the teaching of religion, creationism, “creation science”, “creation facts”, and ID.--Indeed, they are, lacking any scientific content of ID, quite the same. The history of ID, via the Wedge Document, and the seminal work of Barbara Forrest and Paul R Gross titled ""Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design"" should be an addition to anyone's library. See for more information     http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com    /--Island--This kind of stereotypically predictable reaction-ism, and the ideologically distorted half-truths or blatant lies that go with it, are the reason why I’ve started this very incomplete list for the next academic freedom go-round in Florida.--You may be too harsh towards ID proponents. As I and others have, quite convincingly I would argue, shown, the right to speak is not a right to be heard. Certainly, there is no compelling reason why ID has earned a right to be heard in science classes, not because it is religiously motivated, that seems self evident, but rather because it has no scientific content.As to ID's claims against evolutionary theory, Nick Matzke is doing a fine job at exposing how ignorance or avoidance of scientific research can lead one to make some very silly claims about what evolution can and cannot do. For an even more chilling example, I suggest one reads Wells' ""Icons of Evolution"" and then the scientific reality as documented by the NCSE    http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wells    /claims of academic freedom to attempt to get scientifically vacuous ideas introduced into our schools' curricula should be rejected by anyone interested in the future of education in this country."
1,"--Island--No, as I said, they are ""typically"", by law, strictly prohibitive of ID creationism, which is a huge difference that you don't want to willingly acknowledge. Your attempt to downplay the significance and the teeth of these laws is highly telling.--ID creationism seems not dissimilar from other creationist attempts to introduce God into our science curriculum. ID, lacking scientific vacuity is now attempted to be smuggled back in under the guise of ""academic freedom"" or ""teach the controversy"" even though ID is neither academic nor controversial in a scientific sense as it is at best without content.Perhaps I am missing your point here."
1,"--JoeWe look at the options. And the anti-ID option is ""it just happened"". We do have direct observatiuons of agencies designing rotary motors. We have NEVER observed nature, operating freely, even come close.--No the scientific position is 'we don't know'. Surely you should realize that misrepresenting the scientific position does little for your argument. And there are more than just two options. Chance, regularity, already provide two possibilities, not to mention the countless variations on this theme. Remind me again how ID 'explains' the bacterial flagellum? After all, was it not claimed to be an inference to the best explanation. Are you saying that there is no explanation?Weird, why would they then call it an inference to best explanation?...What do you think?--So when it comes to teaching the theory of evolution the only real answer is ""we don't know""- as in we don't know whether or not the transformations required by universal common descent are even possible via any amount of accumulated mutations.--Again missing the point, the 'we don't know' explanation is countered by real positive scientific hypotheses and these hypotheses have rendered the 'we don't know' hypothesis much less relevant. Of course minor questions still remain but the idea that there must be limits to evolution that would make common descent impossible are at best wishful thinking.It's sad how you continue to misunderstand science."
1,"The National Center for Science Education has a good reason to be concerned about 'Intelligent Design'. The reason for this concern is to be found in a leaked document which outlines the motivations behind the 'Intelligent Design' movement, called the ""Wedge"".    http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html    __Governing Goals__    * To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies.    * To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and hurnan beings are created by God.After having failed to gain intellectual traction, the ID approach changed to 'teach the controversy' and when that failed, to ""academic freedom"". Of course, while this is, as several people have so well explained, is NOT an issue of academic freedom, the 'bait and switch' strategies of ID continue under the motto of ""the end justifies the means"".Ask yourself, would you want your kids taught unscientific concepts in their schools' science classes? If your answer is ""of course not"", then why are you undermining ""academic freedom""?The answer is simple, it is not really an issue of ""academic freedom"".So ask yourself, ""What has ID done to positively contribute to science?""Tricky isn't it."
1,"Perhaps what is needed is to distinguish between academic freedom and peer review. Many regulations about academic freedom are broad, and like laws and regulations about free speech, can protect someone like a tenured professor from being fired even if researching something that most academics consider nonsense.Academic freedom is one thing. But whether the research being done by someone whose academic freedom is protected is in fact worthwhile or not is a completely separate question. To determine that, it is necessary to look at the evidence, the evaluation of peers and other experts, the fruitfulness of the research program, and other such factors. It is in this area that ID is clearly lacking, as even some of its proponents acknowledge.Proponents of ID can call for academic freedom all they want, but the freedom to explore a topic has no relevance, ultimately, to the question of the merit of one's conclusions. Intelligent Design, it must be recalled, was the prevailing viewpoint for a very long time. So was flood geology. Far from there being a conspiracy to stifle such views, many scientists in the 19th century were extremely reluctant to depart from these established viewpoints. But the consensus changed because of the enormous amounts of evidence pointing to a different set of conclusions being more likely.And this, in a nutshell, is the issue. The proponents of Intelligent Design and of young-earth creationism have this in common: they want to drag science back to the 19th century, as though all the progress and all the evidence amassed in the mean time doesn't matter."
1,"""The debate here is false, because both ID and Darwinian/natural selection theory are inadequate.""Whether or not the Theory of Evolution is ""inadequate"" is not an issue.  The question is: Is it scientific?  Does it have a scientific mechanism that could explain and predict the ""tree of life""?But there is no ""Theory of Intelligent Design"" and it can never be scientific.The overall question is: Does intelligent design have merit?  The obvious answer is no - because it explains everything (every living thing is designed?) and yet it does not have any kind of scientific ""mechanism"" (like mutation and natural selection) that could ever actually explain anything."
2,"""Teachers have no freedom to misinform and miseducate students."" There is no proof of either side in this issue. Where is the missing link? Teachers should be teaching both sides and presenting only facts that are able to be proven. We have no proof that evolution really happened as we have no proof that ID never happened. Remember that Darwin was a true racist. Read ""Origin of the species"" He claims that the Irish are the bottom of the evolutionary food chain. I guess teachers have the right to teach the ravings of a racist if it fits their needs."
1,"Purelabor claims that there is no proof for either side. Now I appreciate that he admits that ID has not proof but evolutionary theory is based on an exceptional depth and breadth of evidence.To call Darwin a true racist you have to ignore the facts. But I understand that calling him a racist is much easier than to refute his theory.Oh, I understand.Ignorance is a powerful motivator amongst some creationists, ID reinforces that by calling it design."
2,"You can't offer anymore than theory for one or the other. I just believe that an open mind is far more important than only one view that can not be proven. As for Darwin, have you read his books or are just brain washed into thinking that science is always right. Cattle follow the leader without questioning the direction. I don't know the answer. However, I keep an open mind. Remember that once upon a time, man knew that the world was flat, he knew the world was the center of the universe and he knew that the Earth sat on the shoulders of giant elephants. Science is sometimes wrong. Like it or not. But, I would like to see the missing link that can't seem to be found. I didn't say one way or the other. But I have read the works of Darwin, and anyone that bias I have a problem with. And he was a racist. Read before you go up to call out the big boys. If you don't see the racist in his works than I feel sorry for you."
1,"--You can't offer anymore than theory for one or the other. I just believe that an open mind is far more important than only one view that can not be proven.--On the contrary, I could fill countless books to support the Darwinian and evolutionary theories while the ID 'theory' can be summarized as 'I do not understand: thus poof'--As for Darwin, have you read his books or are just brain washed into thinking that science is always right. Cattle follow the leader without questioning the direction.--I have read most of his books and even some of his unpublished manuscripts. Furthermore, Darwinism as it exists today is strengthened by a vast amount of additional knowledge not originally accessible to Darwin.--I don't know the answer. However, I keep an open mind.--No you don't. You have not studied evolutionary theory which you so foolishly describe as lacking evidence.-- And he was a racist. Read before you go up to call out the big boys. If you don't see the racist in his works than I feel sorry for you.--Note the lack of evidence and the name calling. All clear evidence of a lack of argument.Well done, purelabor but you surely can do better than this now can you?

1,"So Luskin is accusing NCSE of being both anti-religion and pro-religion.  He can't make up his mind, oscillating randomly between his desire to call NCSE a bunch of nasty atheists and his desire to call them a bunch of nasty science-and-religion-are-compatible-ists (creationists hate theistic evolution probably more than they hate the atheists, because theistic evolutionists disconfirm the creationist view which is that evolution = atheism).

1,"There are two, and they are fundamentally different. They both seem to be Hebrew adaptions of earlier creation myths. The value of them is not their historical accuracy, but the way they redefine the nature of God. Before, God (gods) were caught in the web of circumstance as surely as man. By taking God as an outside force creating all, the Hebrews set a new tone.The authors of the Bible never imagined themselves to be writing history in the modern sense. They were trying for a more fundamental truth. They wished to illuminate the human condition and its relationship to God. They were artists, not photographers. "

1,"To start with with, I think the Wikipedia page:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_according_to_Genesis  has a good summary of the stories. Nobody, you can say you believe in the literal words, but you didn't answer the question of which words. I didn't use science or philosophy - just the plain Biblical language. In one version, man is created last. In the other, man is created far earlier - and the rest of Eden is created for him. Both put man in a primary position, but they have different orders. So if you can please resolve the difference for me without ill-mannered yelling and accusations, I would appreciate it. And if you could spell properly, that would be good also. Faith is not inconsistent with learning. As for the argument that somehow God's measurements are different form our own, why would God do that? If you follow that argument, then you need not believe ANYTHING in the Bible since it could be that God meant something beyond our understanding. If God speaks to us, then he must use the words we can understand or we cannot be expected to heed them.However, if there is one consistent thing in faith, it is that everybody who has experienced God puts it beyond words or human comprehension. When Isiah cried 'Holy, Holy, Holy', perhaps a better translation would be 'Other. Other, Other'. He was using holy as the opposite of profane - the day to day versus the beyond human understanding. To accept this though is to accept that the Bible is a human - not divine - creation. But again, if you are to believe the Bible literally, another question is, which Bible? I have two in my house, and the modern translation is different. At the start of John, the King James speaks of the darkness not being able to comprehend the light while the other says it cannot overcome the light. Those are very different to my mind. One is conflict, the other is a separation. As I try to divine God's will, which should I use as a starting point?Of course both use the English 'word'. That is a translation from the Greek 'logos', a word for which there is no true English equivalent. Once again, Wikipedia has as good a summary as any:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos  Without some scholarship, no cursory reading of the passage can convey all the meanings it would have had for the author. But then much of John is different from the other gospels. Each was written for a different audience and emphasizes different aspects of Jesus. John's timeline for the events in Christ's death is factually inconsistent with the other synoptic gospels. But more important is the tenor of John. Written after the fall of the Temple, I believe John's main purpose was to establish Christianity as the legitimate successor to the only other Jewish branch to escape the 'cult of the temple' - the Pharisees. The scorn and derision heaped upon the Jews, particularly the Pharisees, seems more appropriate for discrediting a foe than loving an enemy. I am always willing to learn more. But please spare me the yelling, the putting words in my mouth, the anger that is totally inappropriate to discussing the divine. There is a Buddhist quote, ""My teaching is like a finger pointing to the moon. Do not mistake the finger for the moon."".  Too many Christians have mistaken the Bible (the finger) for the moon (the will of God). Irenaeus taught that all that was needed was faith. The laity to have faith in the deacons, the deacons to have faith in the bishops. At the same time, he declared the gnostics - who believed in finding their own truth - heretics. The Bible does have Truth in it. But I believe it is the truth of art, of emotion, and of the human condition. Fact and history as we accept them didn't even exist when the Bible was written. For a very interesting commentary on the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament to us Christians), you might go to:   http://oyc.yale.edu/religious-studies   The course looks at the Hebrew Bible from the standpoint of what it meant to those who wrote it. It provides context and depth. And it does cover some of the creation story in addition. "
1,"7: And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.8: And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.9: And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.15: And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.16: And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:17: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.18: And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.19: And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.Clearly God made man, then planted Eden, then made animals. To take another interpretation would be to say the Bible listed things out of order.  "
1,"If it is, then only a malicious God would tell it out of order, use terms we cannot understand, or have other 'traps' while holding us to its words. I believe the term many use is 'inerrant'. They believe every word was overseen by God. That view is inconsistent with two accounts where clearly things are happening in a different order. 'Inspired by God' is a good phrasing. Clearly much of both stories was 'borrowed' from earlier creation myths. The question is not whether it is literally true, but what did those early Jews change that enabled them to find a faith that has lasted 1,000s of years? Two things seem to stand out - God as outside nature, and man as His highest creation.If you can get past the historical accuracy problem, you find the stories both telling the same tale. God is separate - inhabiting a another sphere. And that God created man, has cared for him, and has given him a special place in His order. "
1,The order of events in Genesis I agree with   science  .
1,"Certainly, there is value in the documents from which human culture has derived the Christian Bible; the value of which is to be determined individually by the reader. Let us not forget the context in which these documents were written and remember that they represent merely the views of those who wrote them. They may or may not reflect the truth. Whatever truth they may or may not contain must be determined by other facts and argument from facts.The ""Book of Genesis"" is one book and a narrow view. It is grossly insufficient to answering the question - how long did it take for the universe, this galaxy, this solar system, this planet and life on the Earth to form. It is terribly insufficient to answer what is ultimately an unanswerable and incomplete question. The Christian Bible and the question itself both miss a higher truth - none of the above is finished forming ... nor are we.The natural processes that created the Earth and its life in the past are not finished. They continue to create and we each too are instruments of that continuing creation."
1,"How can anyone believe that the human race began with just one pair, Adam and Eve, and refuse to face the logical consequence that the human race would have to have with brother-sister incest?  If God wanted to start the human race with just one pair of biological ancestors, then He must have ordained incestuous marriage for at least the first generation of humans.  However, books like Leviticus in chapters 18 and 20, incest is clearly condemned.  This includes incestuous brother-sister marriage!  That's the main reason why I have embraced theistic    evolution    instead of the Genesis creation accounts."
1,"Actually I meant to say that if Adam and Eve's children had to practice incest in order to ""go forth and multiply"" then it meant that God ordained it.  And the same God condemn it centuries later.  Does this mean that incest is forbidden only for Jews, Christians, etc. who regard the Bible are their authority?B. Rainey"

1,"I recall somewhere in genesis when   god   banished and marked cain, some sort of reference to other people being alive other than just the ""first"" family (ie adam,eve,cain, and abel) and that the only reason that he would have marked abel was to protect him, but protect him from whom if they are indeed the only other people? so that logically leads to the assumption that there were other people living along side the ""first family""."
2,"Teaching creationism's truth is necessary in upholding the truth of the Bible. There is a great deal at stake in the claim that God did not create the world in seven days: the Bible says that he did; if he did not, then the Bible is wrong. If the Bible is wrong on this, we cannot trust it on anything else and the entire Christian faith can be viewed as a lie. Atheists claim it is not appropriate to teach creationism as a 'truth' and evolution should be taught as a theory. However, those churches that fail to uphold the faith in creationism and even accept the theory of evolution are compromising their faith.
"
1,"--And as with ALL scientific inferences further research can either confirm or refute that inference.--Sure, just like 'we don't know' generates the same research or more than 'design (wink wink)' did it.So at best ID is nothing more than the 'we don't know' position, but rather than calling it ignorance, they call it 'design'. What a bait and switch."

2,"Only someone who does not beleive in God would have to ask how the world was created in six days. So then, is he the intelligent designer? The one who could creat reality from nothing? Scientist have it hard only having to work with what is already made. Trying to play God is never an easy task. Science will only have more questions and more discoveries but will still find more dead ends. It all started when the devil told man he could be like God. Even now the curiosty still beckons like an unopened door. They say the new face transplants are a huge success. They can now reproduce ear organs off a rodent and now are finding more planets. Aww man, now it's not 9 any more. Another thing my son is going to hold over my head. Bottom line you cannot disprove 6 day creation."
2,"Several scientists have already admitted that the account of Creation as described in Genesis has definite validity.  Imagine that!  Science and the Scriptures agreeing on something - that's because the same God who created our Universe also created   science   and mathematics.

But Sidneyc, I am all for the scientific reproduction of body parts like ears, noses, and limbs, not as a means of mass production, so to speak, but rather as a genuine procedure to restore quality of life to millions of survivors.  Think of the enormous benefits and psychological improvements to people whose faces have been disfigured,   workers   who have lost their fingers, feet, or other limbs in serious accidents, or   children   who were born blind or with some other birth defect.  Not all of what researchers are doing in this field for future generations is evil or bad: God gave them the knowledge and ability to pursue these goals and make them a reality.  I look forward to the day when science and   medicine   will finally be able to restore a person's sight or hearing without the help of permanently-embedded artificial devices.  To that I say, Hallelujah, Amen!"
2,"Ricardo, The Bible was definitely written as is.  All those horrible things you wrote were correct and they definitely happened.  I think it was put there on purpose because it was meant to show to the world/readers the cause and effects of   sin  , of rebellion against God, and that the reason God came to this earth (Jesus) was to save each one of us.  Had the Bible were written with only beautiful and perfect sceneries or stories, I wouldn't have believed it.  But millions throughout the centuries could then relate to the events written in it because they had been ""there"" as well.   Suppose you are reading an Owner's Manual for a car or vehicle, etc.  I copied and pasted the following from a Camry Owner Manual:[Seat belts must also be worn by expectant mothers: the risk of injury in the case of accident is much greater for them and their unborn child too if they do not have a seat belt on....][Placing a cradle child seat's in front during inflation could cause serious injury...]If all you focus is on the negatives and if you are not seeing the big picture, you probably will never be driving a car in your life.  The Bible was written as is, because otherwise it will be one-sided, no one believes a one-sided story.I suggest you to read the Bible in its entirety.  The bestselling book in the history of the world that brought changes into people's lives.  It is a love story that God came to this world to save us from the destructive sin."
2,it's not that cut and dried..  some things were meant to be literal - others.. clearly not.Revelations is an example where clearly symbolism is used.  No fundamental christian could discount that symbolism is used alot... and metaphors.. and analogies...and parables.. etc. etc.So that leads us to the conclusion that you can't rule out symbolism in any other passage. - so really the question comes down to 'If you feel the Bible was divine in origin.. do you feel 6 day creation was meant literally'. -and really - I assume it was meant literal.. largely based on the reference to 'evening and morning' repeatedly.So just because you have an 'as is' Bible doesn't mean cultural relativism isn't the case in some aspects - 'an eye for an eye' - was the old   law  .. for example.. turn the other cheek was   the law   when Christ came..  other parts are documentation of jewish law - others the genealogical line of Jesus...  each section has to be interpreted individually for it's given intent... it's simply not an 'all or nothing'.. either literal or metaphor concept..  a full understanding is necessary.
1,"“it's not that cut and dried.. some things were meant to be literal - others.. clearly not.”How can you objectively determine which things are to be taken literally and which are not?“Revelations is an example where clearly symbolism is used. No fundamental christian could discount that symbolism is used alot... and metaphors.. and analogies...and parables.. etc. etc.”Why is Revelations ‘clearly symbolism’ when the parts about burning bushes and massive floods are not?  Many fundamentalists take Revelations as being the literal truth, how do you demonstrate that they are wrong.  More importantly, how can a third party determine which view is correct? “So that leads us to the conclusion that you can't rule out symbolism in any other passage.”Yet there are those who take the entire Bible as the literal truth… that there is no symbolism present.  How can the literal and symbolic parts be objectively  verified?“ - so really the question comes down to 'If you feel the Bible was divine in origin.. do you feel 6 day creation was meant literally'. -and really - I assume it was meant literal.. largely based on the reference to 'evening and morning' repeatedly.”And for those who do not find the Bible to be of divine origin?  I’ll grant you that from a Christian perspective it claiming that the Bible is of divine origin is an important part of the Christian faith… But the same does not hold for those who are not Christian.“each section has to be interpreted individually for it's given intent... it's simply not an 'all or nothing'.. either literal or metaphor concept.. a full understanding is necessary.”At what objective point is ‘full understanding’ reached?  How can intent be objectively verified?"
2,"Look at it like this.... first off, words are metaphors - they are symbols of an object.. some more exact than others.  From this starting point we can see that language always only approximates an idea.. language is not math.From here we can see that the Bible already is going to not have any sort of 100% exact meaning.. because language itself is always open to interpretation.  Intent can NOT be 100% verified... it's simply not possible.  Any line I write is up to individual interpretation -- it's unavoidable.When the Bible says the inhabitants of the earth are to God like grasshoppers... well, that is a metaphor - and yes, the Bible is full of them.  Does that mean it isn't true? Not at all.. but the poetic nature of the statement is unavoidable.This problem of language, it's nature, is part of why we debate like this... It's semantics.. When I said a 'full understanding' of the Bible is necessary.... it suffers from the same problems any statement made in a verbal language does - it suffers from not being 'completely correct'.  You can't technically have a 'full understanding' of anything... No one has a full understanding of chemistry.. or even english.. or even gravity. - Your questioning of my phrase 'full understanding' gives a perfect example of the problems with interpreting the Bible or any book.   Language is faulty.. there is no 'true' definition for any word.... especially since it is only defined by other words - which in turn are defined by other words......Given this concept we can see that the meaning of anything isn't precise - and the Bible will always be the subject of interpretation.  Parables and the like can be considered literally 'true' but yet metaphors.  If I say that stars are like pin pricks in the curtain of night... the statement is true - but entirely metaphor... and given another viewpoint one could say false as well - -since one could argue they are nothing 'like' pin-pricks in a curtain.Do you see my point?  People can see the Bible as literally true - and still understand it is full of metaphors.  The question remains.. which are true metaphors.. and which are meant without poetics.By reading the Bible for understanding it helps you determine which parts are meant in a poetic sense and which is meant as metaphor.  Can anyone insist that they are correct in their interpretation? nope.  But with study.. people tend to have better understanding - that's all I mean.Can someone 'prove' the Bible means a literal 6 day creation.. nope.  like all of language.. it's up to opinion.  I stated my opinion.. that it appears a literal 6 days was the intent - I cited the repetitive use of the words 'evening and morning' as one reason for my opinion - but it's still opinion and cannot be 'proven'.And as far as your question about what merit the Bible has to non-Christians.... well obviously little - else they would be Christians =)"
1,"“From here we can see that the Bible already is going to not have any sort of 100% exact meaning.. because language itself is always open to interpretation.”True, however you have stated that some verses in the Bible are literal truth and others are symbolic.  How can the literally true lines be separated from the symbolic ones?  Christian archeologists have been searching for verifiable evidence of the supernatural claims in the Bible for centuries now… and so far they have either found no clear proof, only contradictory proof.“When the Bible says the inhabitants of the earth are to God like grasshoppers... well, that is a metaphor - and yes, the Bible is full of them. Does that mean it isn't true? Not at all.. but the poetic nature of the statement is unavoidable.”Sure, but objectively many religions from that time period placed their deity in the heavens.  The same could be said for Zeus, Horus-Re, Rannma…  Why is the Bibles statements valid and their statements are false?“By reading the Bible for understanding it helps you determine which parts are meant in a poetic sense and which is meant as metaphor. Can anyone insist that they are correct in their interpretation? nope. But with study.. people tend to have better understanding - that's all I mean.”Even following study people cans still reach different meanings, which is reasonable if are not taking parts of the Bible literally.  Once you have claimed that a part of the Bible is a literal description of what has happened then anyone who tells you that that part is symbolic is verifiably wrong.  If I have a passage in a book that says “A tree grows on North Hill” and I say that there IS a tree growing on North Hill and you say it is a metaphor I can take you to North Hill and show you the tree.  Any metaphorical meanings aside the text is literal.“Can someone 'prove' the Bible means a literal 6 day creation.. nope. like all of language.. it's up to opinion. I stated my opinion.. that it appears a literal 6 days was the intent - I cited the repetitive use of the words 'evening and morning' as one reason for my opinion - but it's still opinion and cannot be 'proven'.”Except for the mountain of evidence against a literal 6 day creation… If you want to say ‘I believe that in a six day creation’ then I cannot argue with your beliefs…. Any more then I can argue with someone who claims that the queen of England is a shape-shifting lizard man from outerspace.You’ve stepped beyond that, claiming that there is evidence to back up your beliefs.  My challenge is to that evidence.And as far as your question about what merit the Bible has to non-Christians.... well obviously little - else they would be Christians =)Which represent a significant portion of the world’s population.  If it is literally true that the world was created in six days then that fact is independent of a persons belief, just like fact that the world is round and orbits the sun."
1,"In 1925 when questioned by Clarence Darrow, William Jennings Bryan stood by the Bible. But when ask, was the world created in six days, he said no, the Bible doesn't say that. There is a difference of opinion here. Bryan, who took almost the entire Bible, very literally, didn't in this case. The danger is that when the Bible is made to stand or fall on this one point against established   science   it often looses."
1,"Creationist want God to be both all powerful and outside the physical forces he supposedly created. They never realize that to participate in ""our"" reality he would have had to relinquish his ""outside sphere. Creationists want the   bible   to be the literal word of   god   but anytime a contradiction is brought up it gets attributed to the human scribes. Couldn't a god find better help, or even give a quick proofread of what he dictated. The real question is why didn't he just write it himself instead of depending on people who make mistakes.Finally, they want God to be so mysterious that no one can understand him. Yet they fail to see how futile their own beliefs are based upon a being that they cannot understand and then expect everyone else to accept what must be a human interpretation of a divine mystery, which in the end can be understood by no one.Personally, I think you can believe what you want but it is very foolish to try and find some kind of scientific backing for these religious belief and mysteries. You either have   faith   or you don't. Science can't help you with your faith, since it is by nature the antithesis of faith."
2,"As I said earlier experience demonstrates that it matters a great deal to an investigation whether or not that which is being investigated occurred via agency involvement or by nature, operating freely.There is just no getting around that fact.As for the ""bait and switch""- that would be you. Who else would say ""we don't know"" and then allow the teaching of the ""no design allowed"" position?""We don't know but we do know a designer wasn't involved."""
2,"Genesis is very clear that the evening and the morning were the first day. Genesis is very clear, God made the vegetation on the third day and He did not make the sun, moon, and stars until the fourth day.  Well, you can have the vegetation survive twenty-four hours without the sun, but you cannot have it survive a thousand years or sixty million years without the sun.  And so the ones that try to   stretch   the   creation   into a long period of time—they just have to throw the Bible out because the Bible is very clear.  New Testament, Old Testament, Jesus Himself said it was six days that God made the world.  Also, if you think six days are six years or six million years, then do you worship the Sabbath day (Fourth Commandment) for millions of years as in Sabbath centuries?  Ridiculous.  This very argument will either support the entire Bible, Ten Commandments, and all that, or go against everything that the Bible says.You know, the reason that so many people are trying to fit evolution into the Bible someway is that they’re just sure that all these scientists are saying this, that we must respect this, that we must respect this, and it’s true.  Friends, listen, the foundation for evolution, for evolutionary philosophy, is their dating system.  If you prove that they’re building on the sand, there’s nothing left. Their dating system is terribly flawed and all you have to do is look at their own reports regarding the dating system, get your encyclopedias out, look up   carbon   14 radioisotope dating; it will say right there that it is unreliable.  And it is based upon the premise, because no one was around six thousand, seven thousand years ago to record these things—written history goes back 4000 years, 5000 years.  And so they’re doing it all in the premise that the environmental deterioration has been consistent, and my Bible says the   environment   went through a radical catastrophic change 5000 years ago during the flood. And the fossil record tells us that there’s been a tremendous change.  The fossil record is very clear that these   animals   all died suddenly and were covered with deposits of mud instantly.  They used to say that the dinosaurs died off slowly because of climate changes, but they’ve had to come back and say “Well, it must have been an asteroid that hit the earth because it was a cataclysmic flood and an asteroid hit the ocean.” Well, friends, my Bible has said that for thousands of years.  It was a flood, but it wasn’t an asteroid that did it.  There's a free book from the AmazingFacts.org  1-800-835-6747.  Ask for “How Evolution Flunked the Science Test”. Six Literal Days."
1,"Carbon 14 is not the only method of dating used to determine the age of the universe.  We can look out into the cosmos and see structures that have come about via billions of years of action, or that are so far away that they would have had to be in place billions of years ago for the light to have reached us by now.  There is also the ice core data that goes back more then six thousand years.It's also important to note that Carbon 14 production is statistically uniform over a geological time scale, since it comes from cosmic ray interactions in the upper atmosphere.  As such it cannot be used to pin down an exact date (February 8th, 1,245,984 years ago) but is still useful for estimating a date range .""And the fossil record tells us that there’s been a tremendous change. The fossil record is very clear that these   animals   all died suddenly and were covered with deposits of mud instantly.""Is it?  Though some fossils have come from creatures being covered in mud that is not the explanation for all of them.  One can also ask why the levels cluster creatures as they do.  If people lived along side mammoths and stegosauri then why are mammoth and stegosauri fossils not intermingled?  And why are there no fossilized humans in the mix?""Well, friends, my Bible has said that for thousands of years. It was a flood, but it wasn’t an asteroid that did it.""The   bible   is just one of many religious texts explaining the history of the world."
1,"To the 23% currently   voting   ""Yes"", that raises six immediate questions:1) I assume this means the sun was created first (how many days did that take?) to even have a ""day""?2) How long did creating the rest of the universe take? Or, if it took six whole days to create the earth, would the creator have had time to create all the rest, I mean, some of these galaxies are awfully huge and with a lot of intricatekly moving interstellar dust and radiation that had to be started off precesly right to fool modern astronomers?3) Why did the creator go to all this trouble to conceal the evidence behind a massive cover-up of radiological datings, cosmic radiation and, well, essentially the entire findings of geology and astronomy as supported by chemistry and physics?4) Why create all the ""kinds"" of   animals   during these days, and then conceal this astounding fact behind what to evolutionary biologists and paleontologists seem an amazingly consistent set of interlocking facts from genetics, behaviour, morphology, biogeography, extinctions, speciations, fossils records, epidemiology and immunology that fits with life evolving according to rather well understood processes?5) Why were so much of this omitted from the Bible? I mean, a few hints about geology to predict earthquakes, or the germ theory of disease would have been rather handy to thwart the devil's work, and a description of relativity would have been impressive. Why, in fact, conceal everything not already known to the iron-age people of the Middle East who wrote the book?6) Are you serious? "
2,"As one commenter has already touched on..I'm sure of one thing... I trust the one who made the Geologist... - not the Geologist.Even a skeptic or atheist should be able to admit:  The wisdom of the Bible is quoted more than any other book... even by the secular community.  Is that simply because the authors were 'really good writers'?  It's no accident.. the book is clearly divinely inspired.  So many people are willing to pass off the stories as simply having 'good morals' or some type of poetic worth... I was an atheist at one point and saw the book through such a lens.  Now, with an understanding of God's existence.. I look back at the book and wonder how I could have ever interpreted it this way.If you believe there is a God... then I can't see how you would accept the idea that he is allowing lies to be spread in his name - It may be difficult for you to accept the 6 day story.. but that's understandable.. you are human after all.. and prone to misunderstanding (myself included of course).If you accept a being created us.. the stars.. and all we see.  A being that defined the elements and set in place the physical laws, yet you draw the line at a 6 day creation, well that seems awfully faithless.  As far as a young earth or a old one, there's so much information pouring out from both sides of the argument that I've found myself shifting back and forth.. one moment I believe one side.. and then I read more and switch to the other.  Honestly I haven't made a complete decision and possibly never will.  I'm truly not sure that a 6 day creation is hindered by an old earth anyway.. The lord does work in mysterious ways indeed.  Consider for example Answers in Creation's 'Plausible Deniability' argument:  Simply put.. if we ever were to confirm a young earth it would push the idea of God to an area where it was probable even from a skeptic's perspective.  If that were the case then it would destroy the necessity for faith.  It's obvious God has avoided there being anything which unquestionably points to his existence.. and for good reason.  We must commit to his existence on our own...   science   isn't going to give us that holy grail we are looking for.But no matter which is true - 4.54 billion years or a handful of thousand... this doesn't change the fact that if God said it.. I trust him - not his flawed creation.  If you believe the Bible is only metaphor.. then you obviously believe God had no hand in it.  This means you believe in a God which has allowed his name to be trampled from the dawn of time.  That is a belief I will never subscribe to."
1,"The Bible is the most published and most wide spread book of all times... which does not mean that it is true... and was also an important part of   education   (in some cases the only source of education) for centuries.

A being that defined the elements and set in place the physical laws, yet you draw the line at a 6 day creation, well that seems awfully faithless.""And if you don't accept that?  What physical proof can be offered to back up those claims.""Simply put.. if we ever were to confirm a young earth it would push the idea of God to an area where it was probable even from a skeptic's perspective. If that were the case then it would destroy the necessity for faith""So God is deceitful?  Laying false evidence about to ensure that people go wrong?"
2,"People tend to focus on the trees.. and miss the forest entirely.Such simplistic arguments like 'How could you have a day if there wasn't a sun yet?'...*sigh*Such a limited creation we are... so lost in the details.  If you really must have an answer to such a question... simply put - God invented the very concepts of day and night... and even if there were no sun yet, a day was still a day.  Or maybe he did it just so that you would ask the question I suppose..  There is some truth to that as well.. I know that much of what God has done was deliberately intended to cause debates like this.  Atheists absolutely hate that response, they maintain that a loving God would never want to confuse us.  I agree, he didn't want to confuse us.. but he did want to leave plenty of room for you to not believe in him.  It's completely your choice - your free will.  Faith is not suppose to be easy."
1,"""I agree, he didn't want to confuse us.. but he did want to leave plenty of room for you to not believe in him. It's completely your choice - your free will""So it's follow an idea that contradicts all rational logic and evidence, or suffer for eternity in a fiery pit?That does not sound very benevolent to me."
2,"You are exactly right - evidence is all around you, mountains of it in fact.Consider the observation of a solar eclipse.   The sun is 91 million miles away (or so), our moon is 238,000 miles (or so) - to spare me the looking up of the exact ratios - can we agree they are VASTLY different in size... yet during a solar eclipse they line up exactly.  What do you feel are the chances?The moon is necessary to our life for a wide number of reasons - light during night time, tidal forces, the affect on the tilt of the earth's axis, and also for measurement of time.Everything in the universe has the same situation.. a conspicuously planned appearance which defies logical explanation by chance.  I've argued about this subject enough that I truly don't have the interest in going further - the evidence is all around you.  You have chosen a materialistic option as the cause... a universe that popped into being by random accident from no known source.. DNA that appeared full of information.. my accident as well.. and the vast varieties of life.. also by accident.When I was an atheist I saw no evidence for God... once I believed - I looked again and realized 'how could I have been so blind... everything is evidence!'To choose to ignore the designed nature of the universe is willful ignorance.  But yes, he is a benevolent God.. because all who seek him will find him if they do so earnestly."

2,"Yes I'm fully aware what a Solar Eclipse is.. the point was that not only do they line up - the sun and moon fill each other precisely.  This would not happen by chance... for example if it were possible to stand on the surface of Jupiter I highly doubt that any 1 of it's 63 orbiting bodies would exhibit the same effect.  The point is that the moon to sun ratio causes them to appear the exact size... got it?.. What are the odds?  The only planet where life exists is the only planet where this spectacle can be enjoyed....And the moon is essential to life since it stabilizes our tilt on our axis.. without it the earth would wobble causing massive   climate change  .

I'm afraid you are completely missing that point though...Also, it's silly to assume our eyes would adapt to the pitch black of night if there was no moon... half the day we would still be in sunlight.

2,actually I'm not simply looking backwards... I'm looking at it statistically.. in the case of the moon it is not only a necessity for life - the eclipse that I've mentioned is statistically ridiculous.  You say is it 'extremely unlikely'... no... that is putting it ungodly lightly.  If you look at it as simply being 'improbable' but so what.... then that's your choice.   We have no real choice but to 'look backwards' - so in other words any evidence is not evidence for you.  DNA could be called 'highly unlikely'.. and so could matter spewing out and forming entire universes..... this is 'the gamblers fallacy'.  If you simply think that all the species of life and the universe itself is no more than a very lucky flipping of infinite coins... be my guest - but the reasoning is not sound.
1,Today (July 22nd 2009) the 'best' solar eclipse of the century took place from India to Japan.  Reading about this I have again read over the mechanics of what exactly a solar eclipse is... and that it causes eclipses is in no way indicative of intent behind it's size and position.  During a solar eclipse only a tiny fraction of the earth is actually fully covered...  http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur.php

1,"Why do we even ask this question?  PEOPLE, Evolution is a fact,   science   measures facts.  The world is neither 4,000, 6,000, or 37,000 years old.  It is 4 Billion years old.  We can use math to estimate the time of the big bang, it is all FACT.  Gravity is fact, Evolution is fact, Creationism is so ludicrous and moronic that it is not worth even discussing.

1,"The point of the debate is to set up a straw man, that the world was created in six days, that anti-Christians can knock down. The Bible doesn't stand or fall on that statement.

1,"Then why does this argument always seem to come from the creationists?  AiG was not founded, and is not funded by the Scientific community.I also question your use of the term 'anti-Christian'... Supporters of the ToE are not anti-Christian, most don't care what Christians believe as long as they don't try and push it into the realm of Science."
1,"This thread has been kept going by three people who have voted no to the question of a six day creation. AIG has tried to defend Genesis using the weakest possible argument, and then left. They didn't even hang around to defend their position. "
1,There are two possibilities about the origin of the universe: It blinked into existence. Evidence says this still happens today. It was never created. Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
2,Read Genesis Chapter 1.  It explains the whole thing.  There is no such thing as evolution it's a myth.
1,"I'm going to ask both Creationists and Evolutionists to look at the following with a completely open mind for just one minute.  The Bible was written in ancient Hebrew, not English, yes?  We are on the same page so far.  In ancient Hebrew, the word yom can mean day, as in 12 or 24 hour periods, or simply period of time.  Medieval scholars translated yom as day in English.  They did not have a reason not to, yet.  Now, consider that Yahweh was explaining this to a semi-literate group of ancient nomads, with no understanding of the cosmos or the world outside of their little society.  He couldn't explain things to them using complex scientific terms, so he simplified it.  In the beginning, God (the Hebrew word used here is Elohim, which is plural, and not Yahweh, but that's a different argument, so for now I'll just use the more accepted word, ""God"" rather than the correct translation of Gods) said, ""let there be light,"" and there was light.  Since there is no sound in space, the Big Bang would really be more like the Big Flash of LIGHT.  On Day 2, God creates the heavens.  From this Big Flash of Light, stars and planets and everything the ancient Hebrews could see in the heavens were created.  He then, on that same day, seperated the waters of the earth from the waters in the heavens.  Heavy volcanic activity in the early days of Earth's forming spewed a great deal of water vapor from the primordial ocean, forming an atmosphere.  So far, it fits together fairly well.  On Day 3, God seperates the water into one great basin, and dry land appears.  One basin of water and one spot of dry land sounds a lot like Pangea to me.  God also creates plants.  This is the one place where they don't seem to line up absolutely perfectly, as God doesn't create the ""lights in the sky,"" the sun, moon, and stars, until Day 4.  It could perhaps refer to simple, anaerobic, single celled organisms being formed before the smoke and debris from the volcanic activity cleared enough to allow the ""lights in the sky"" to show through.  Obviously, the ancient Hebrews would not have understood the concept of microscopic organisms, so this is a possibility.  On Day 5 God creates the sea creatures (which came first) and the birds (which, along with reptiles, followed).  On Day 6, God creates land animals, which are basically mammals, which also came next according to   evolution  .  Finally, God created man, which fits in perfectly with evolutionary theory.  The only differences are the complexity of terms and the lenght of the days, one caused by necessity and the other caused by poor translation.  The only other difference being that one came several thousand years before the other, but is basically the same thing.  The world was created exactly as the Bible says it was, over billions of years."
1,"Why would God explain this only to ""a semi-literate group of ancient nomads, with no understanding of the cosmos or the world outside of their little   society  ""? Why not give an updated version to modern Jewish or Christian or Islamic scholars? Surely all three groups today include people who understand  geology, astronomy and biology on a rather more comprehensive level than the iron-age authors of Genesis?In fact, being all-powerful, why be limited to the understanding of the writers? At least, if you can create the world, surely you can inspire sentences like ""And the quickness of light shall be found to be always the same relative to the one who looketh; And behold, the quickness of the light when multiplied by itself and the true weight of matter equals the amount of force that went into its making"". Now, an iron-age scribe pondering over the true meaning of those words would have been an argument for divine inspiration."
1,"While I have my own reasons for believing he did that, my personal opinions regarding   religion   are a bit outside of the mainstream, so I'm not going to discuss them.  The Bible says that the Jews are his chosen people.  Why he chose them, Christians don't know.  Like I said, I have my own theories, but they're hardly relevant.  Of course, this doesn't change the fact that the evidence shows this primitive culture's creation myth had some pretty remarkable insights, even if they were conveyed in a rather primitive fashion.  PS, You're quote from the theorhetical Bible was hilarious."
1,"ID can be scientifically relevant if it were to take the scientific approaches used by real science, such as criminology which uses means, motives, opportunities etc. It is simple to show that ID is without content by showing how ID proponents refuse to answer the simple questionHow does ID explain the bacterial flagella?Chirp, chirp.Yes, it matters if something arose throuugh agency or not, the problem is that ID's chosen method has doomed it to remain without content.As to your claims about DNA, and RNA, your claims are at best wishful thinking. Science has done far more for our understanding here than ID will ever do.How does ID explain DNA or RNA? Let me guess, it's that poof thing again."
1,"Very interesting summary. I always thought the light on the first day was the sun, but that is another argument. In school I was taught that in the beginning the atmosphere was fogy filled with heavy gases. When the plants formed they filtered the atmosphere. ""So the Bible was right!"" But the teacher says ""how could they have known."" ""God"" I answered.  "
1,"Most of those heavy gasses were filtered out of the atmosphere before life had even emerged, and the atmosphere was changed to oxygen long before plants evolved."
1,I had always been taught it was the plants. What filtered the atmosphere then  Do you have a reference?
1,  http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/lectures/earth.html  Talks about how procaryote cells (pre-  animals   and plants) converted CO2 and H2O into O2.  http://www.ux1.eiu.edu  /~cfjps/1400/atmos_origin.htmlA bit more depth on where all the hydrogen and helium in the early atmosphere went... as well as a reiteration of the fact that our atmosphere is mostly Nitrogen.
1,Animals convert oxygen to co2. Plants covert co2 to oxygen. Procaryote cells covert co2 to oxygen. There plants!!
1,"So you're saying that because it is written in the Bible that God created the universe in the manner described, then it must be true? I don't even know where to begin on this one. That kind of logic is not really going to cut it with any logical individual, Christian or not. Here are a couple of reasons why:1) The Bible has been translated and retranslated over and over again and been reinterpreted (and in some cases completely rewritten) perhaps thousands of times along the way.along the way so it's beyond question that it has changed in it's original message2) The level of knowledge exhibited by the ancients who wrote the Bible is far removed from our knowledge today, which implies that their view may be less than perfect. Amongst other things, they believed that the earth was flat.3) No one even knows who wrote Genesis. I fail to see why they should be taken as... ahem... gospel.4) Everything word written in Genesis is beyond ridiculous. For example the passage: ""then God said ""Let there be light!""."" which is quite strange really as it was before he created the sun, moon and stars.I could go on but I think I've made my point."
2,"You haven't made a point at all..As I've already said.. I believe.  And I understand that God knows every future event before it ever occurs.  Is it some sort of limitation that the Bible has been translated? He knows the end product for one... and secondly - I've compared many versions.. in most cases the difference is negligible.. it's usually nothing but nit-picking over a word and several possible synonyms.  The message remains the same. Some of the translations I wouldn't recommend.. they are in my opinion clearly inferior versions.. but still the point remains that the message is the same..  Are you familiar with the commandment 'Thou Shalt not Kill?'... is there some question about it's proper translation?  How about 'turn the other cheek'... or 'spare the rod, spoil the child'... 'judge not lest ye be judged' or even 'let there be light'.  Is there some controversy over the translation??  No, there isn't... instead it's just a straw man by atheists.Even those words which people bicker over, an example being the word 'day' in genesis, are truly not very relevant.  In Hebrew from what I understand the word translates loosely to 'a time'... so sure, we could argue he made the earth in a day.. or a billion years - but is that important?  For a Christian definitely not..You also have a problem with 'let there be light' coming before the creation of the sun and stars.So you feel that a God which can create the universe somehow can't create light without the Sun?  I'm pretty sure YOU can even create light without the Sun - in many ways even.The problems people have with the Bible are problems with their understanding... "
1,"""And I understand that God knows every future event before it ever occurs.""So if God has a perfect view of the future then God knew that when he created Adam/Eve, and placed the Tree of Knowledge in Eden that Adam/Eve would not be able to resist the temptation?  Indeed creating them without enough willpower to do so?Or even before that... God created Adam and saw that he was lonely... but God already knew that Adam was going to be lonely.  Why create Adam, wait for him to get lonely, then create Eve?If we take both the Bible as the literal truth, and the view that God is omniscient, then that means that God deliberately created an imperfect mankind... and if we further take that God is omnipotent then that means that God created an imperfect mankind even though a perfect mankind could be created. ""Some of the translations I wouldn't recommend.. they are in my opinion clearly inferior versions.. ""What makes those translations inferior?  God created the Bible knowing that they would be translated that way, so obviously those translations are exactly as God intended them to be.""Are you familiar with the commandment 'Thou Shalt not Kill?'... is there some question about it's proper translation?""Actually yes... a more accurate translation is often seen as 'Thou shall not   murder  ', which is distinct from 'Thou shall not Kill'.'Thou shall not kill' isn't a very practical commandment as we kill things all the time.  Trees are killed every time they are cut down after all.  There is no wiggle room in that statement... but 'Thou shall not murder' allows us to go about our daily lives.""or 'spare the rod, spoil the child'...""Beating your   children   is somewhat frowned upon these days.""So you feel that a God which can create the universe somehow can't create light without the Sun? I'm pretty sure YOU can even create light without the Sun - in many ways even.""What about those who don't believe in the Christian God?"
2,"Yes.. he knew all of that -- he knew we would fall... he knew the translations would vary.. all of the above.  Keep in mind also that some of what we are discussing is my particular viewpoint of God.. not a Catholic, Protestant... or anything like that perspective -first off, I believe in a combination of predestination and free will - that they are both one in the same.  As they say.. it was his 'plan'.  The questions of evil in the world might be difficult for you.. as well as for most people to understand... but not from my viewpoint.  Most importantly.. this life we live is the blink of an eye compared to eternity - pain and death that we perceive as so terrible.. is truly nothing but a dot on the timeline...  look back to a period of your life that was very painful - now that you are far past it.. was it that big of a deal?.. Like I said.. these things are hard for most to understand.. but it's simply a matter of viewpoint.And my point was simply.. that even in the 'inferior' translations - the meaning still is the same.And thou shalt not kill... thou shalt not   murder  . right.. you are talking about semantics - we all understand the meaning.  Those saying they don't are being deliberately difficult and willfully ignorant.. like a child pretending to not understand a parent's meaning simply so they can ignore the implications..All of us know that disciplining a child is important - spare the rod / spoil the child (which is a paraphrase of the actual verses) is an example of that lesson, which is absolutely true.  A child without   discipline   ends up being worse for it throughout his life - ( I'm a good example.. I never learned discipline and because of that I'm terribly irresponsible) These are all good rules.. Any sentence in the   bible   can be misinterpreted.. and misunderstood - yet, the fact remains that the rule itself is correct.As far as those who don't believe in the 'Christian' God... this is an endlessly exaggerated perspective - We only have a few major religions - Islam uses the bible - the jews use the bible - and so do Christians.. among the jews and islamic it's simply they don't feel that Christ was divine.. beyond that they are simply different splinters of Christianity.  Then you have the eastern religions.. which do not profess divinity - for example buddha was a man - that sat beneath a tree and was inspired.. and wrote a book of how people should live...from his deep understanding. This is not even in the same category.  There has only been one   religion   that professed divinity in the way that Christianity has..The point is - any line in the Bible or religious concept can be difficult if you come at it without understanding.. and I'm sure you could continue for pages with examples.. but that is simply misunderstanding.  If I had the inclination to explain each and every one to you... I definitely could.. but really I can't devote my life to this conversation... =)"

1,"In a recent article, Casey Luskin addresses the recent findings that changes in a regulatory gene can help explain the morphological differences between the chimpansee and humans.Luskin however continues the somewhat ignorant statement that this shows how junk dna is not always junk. However, what Luskin does not tell you is that 1) Junk dna was introduced to describe initially pseudogenes etc 2) that regulatory genes were in fact already recognized and never considered junk 3) that said 'regulatory' genes are well conserved and under strong selection.In other words, these findings strengthen, not weaken the argument. Furthermore, the research shows a change of I believe 18 nucleotides out of 80 or so, responsible for the regulation.In fact, early papers had already pointed out that much of the morphological differences between chimps and humans are likely due to regulatory gene changes.Now I understand that Luskin, who is a lawyer, may have been confused by how the popular press portrayed the findings but since he works for an organization which claims its goals are to correct errors in reporting, one would have hoped that Luskin would have quoted from the original research rather than from popular press.Prabhakar S and 9 others. 2008.

1,"""If the Bible is the inspired Word of the infinite Creator God, then it must be self-authenticating and self-attesting—and it is.""Exactly how is the Bible self-authenticating? Cetainly there are archaeologists hard at work in the lands of the Near East trying to find concrete objects - cities - that match with names and events mentioned in the Bible. But how does the Bible self authenticate the verses about four rivers coming out of Eden? It doesn't.What, in general, does self authenticate mean? Does it mean ""make predictions""? What verifiable predictions does the Bible make? How does Genesis help oil companies find oil? It doesn't. Scientific geology helps oil companies find oil. Evolution helps oil companies find oil."
1,"I don't care how many times you say it. You can't prove anything using that same thing, you have to use evidences outside of that.

2,"""You can't prove anything using that same thing, you have to use evidences outside of that.""By using something outside of it, I assume you mean that you have to appeal to something more authoritative. You can't use something LESS authoritative to prove a point. So eventually you come to the end of that argument and you must have an ULTIMATE authority. One either chooses to believe in the ultimate authority of God's Word, or in man's flawed interpretation of the same evidence used by Creation Science, which doesn't exists to try to PROVE the Bible. That would mean that we're putting something else in a place of authority higher than God's Word. You can try your whole life to piece together the past using observations in the present, but if your presumptions and starting points are wrong, how can you even find the truth?

That really makes his case look weak and makes his followers look bad when he pulls some crap like that. "
2,Read Romans Chapter 1.  There is proof.
1,"The question is somewhat meaningless because you can believe that we were created by Design and still conclude that Intelligent Design, as proposed by the Discovery Institute and its fellows,  is a scientifically vacuous concept.For instance, many theistic evolutionists have no problem accepting both the design aspect as a faith element as well as science as providing the best explanation as to 'how'. The problem with ID is that it attempts to argue that the 'how', in the form of evolutionary theory, is somehow unable to explain this. And yet, the concept of a front loading design, is well within the paradigm of how ID approaches the issue and although ID proponents are quick to reject front loading since they have accepted an active participating deity on faith, the simple reality is that a God who set all in motion with the Big Bang, is as much part of the ID explanation as a God who is involved at every single moment in time and space. However, the former is much better supported by the evidence than the latter, for obvious reasons. To counter, ID proponents argue that evolutionary mechanisms lack purpose and are random, both of course are misleading and flawed arguments.First, the concept of purpose or teleology is a complex one, where purpose and function are easily confused and thus when we see the outcome of evolutionary processes that lead to function, one may be tempted to conflate this with purpose. Secondly, evolutionary theory is not random, although aspects of evolutionary theory involve neutral evolution, which involves changes in the genome which are near neutral and have no significant benefit or cost to the organism, evolutionary theory also includes the Darwinian concept of natural selection, which is by definition strongly non-random.ID proponents try to counter this with, yes but random or regular processes cannot explain complexity and information. Which is sort of tautological in ID speak since whenever such processes can explain a complex system with information, the complexity disappears by definition. Since ID proponents often conflate terminology like the concept of information, and attempt to argue that they really mean Shannon information, the simple observation that processes of variation and selection can in fact create information in the genome, in the Shannon sense, undermines any argument ID may have.So what have we determined so far? That scientists can both accept the religious concept of 'design' and still do science without accepting the flawed and scientifically vacuous approaches of ID. In fact, many such Christian scientists would argue that ID not just remains without scientific content but also that its theological claims undermine Christian faith. For instance, imagine, and not much imagination is needed given the recent research, that science finds a more detailed explanation of the bacterial flagellum, which is the cause celebre of the ID movement? This would mean that science has disproven ID, or has it? If it has disproven ID then indeed ID may have some scientific value but why would ID want to open up religious faith to an unreliable design inference? History has shown us plenty of examples where 'design' was falsified, even Newton flunked here. Of course, the reality is that ID is never placing the 'designer' at risk because it is not an argument for Design but rather an argument against evolutionary theory. So all it has done is made a claim that ""science cannot explain X"" and science has done what it does so well, show that the lack of explanation was based on our ignorance not some mystical 'design' explanation. In other words, ID's proposal is not one which proposed an alternative explanation, in fact, it is not better than ""science does not yet understand how X happened"", but rather proposes that a particular scientific hypothesis cannot explain 'X'. By careful bait and switch and a confusion that evidence against a particular evolutionary hypothesis should be counted as evidence in favor of design, ID manages to avoid a scientific formulation of design and still pretend that it proposes a scientifically relevant hypothesis in favor of design.Clever bunch but in the end, vacuous as well.So ""were we created by design""? As a Christian I fully accept this. However, I still reject Intelligent Design's approach not just because it is scientifically without any content but also because I believe it is misleading and dangerous from a theological perspective."
1,"You can't use the Bible to prove the Bible, thus that is an invalid argument. Proof of a deity would be by the scientific method, without the use of religious texts, without the use of ""faith"" and would have to be measured empirically. As it is, there is no way to do this, so the presence/absence of a deity will never be absolutely proven. "
1,"The argument you're making would make sense if we could all just go up to God and ask, ""Hey, is this true?"" and God could give his answer directly to anyone who asked. But remember, when you refer to God's word, you're talking about the transcription of stories that were oral tradition for centuries. That isn't God's word, that's generations and generations of people playing the telephone game with something someone once said he heard from God (sometimes resulting in contradictory statements being supposedly made by the always-correct God). Now, we could use that, or we could use reproducible scientific tests. If you're looking for reliable evidence, there's a clear choice."

1,"""On the Origin of Species"" is out of date. It rightfully retains its historical significance as a turning point in Western society, but modern scientists rarely cite the text directly. Darwin's theory has almost entirely been supplanted by modern refinements. Remember that Darwin published his theory before the discovery of DNA. The mechanism he tentatively proposed to explain the heredity of traits, a critical component in his theory, was flawed and incorrect. Scientists discarded such ideas and incorporated discoveries from biology to create the modern evolutionary synthesis.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis  Darwin's theory was itself a refinement of earlier ideas. It had been known long into antiquity that species inherit traits and change over time. (Domestication of animals, animal breeding, etc) Darwin was the first to propose common descent. His novel idea was that isolated populations of the same species can diverge into separate species after many generations.In stark contrast, ""creation scientists"" will stubbornly resist any discovery that contradicts the earliest formulation of their ""theory."" I use quotes because creationism offers no specific mechanisms and makes no useful predictions. The text upon which the idea is based makes absolutely no claim to scientific accuracy. In fact, the document was written centuries before the scientific method.That is how your comparison fails. Darwin was wrong in many respects, and scientists rightfully discarded those ideas. Young earth creationism is also false on many points, yet ""creation scientists"" have not updated their theory."

2,"All too often the terms of this debate don't get defined.  It's hard to know what is being debated when readers don't know what the NCSE, ARI or AU mean when they say evolution, or when they refer to intelligent design.  Specifically, when defining intelligent design it's important to note that what is most often reported in the media is NOT in any way a definition of the theory that ID proponents subscribe too.  You usually see something along the lines of ""life is so complicated it must have been designed by a higher power.""  That is not at all how the leading proponents of ID describe the theory.  That is how critics like the NCSE or ACLU describe theory. According to the theory of intelligent design, certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.  This definition can be found at:     www.intelligentdesign.org/whatisid.php    .Scientist who support intelligent design seek evidence of design in nature, and argue that such evidence points to intelligent design, based on our historical knowledge of cause and effect. Intelligent design theorists argue in favor of design theory based on the recognition of things like the rich digital information in DNA and the complex molecular machines found in cells. They do so because invariably we know from experience that complex systems possessing such features always arise from intelligent causes.  For instance, the DNA molecule is embedded with an immense amount of information.  In our uniform and repeated experience, information only comes from minds (read: intelligence).  So why should we attribute the information in DNA to a mindless process like Darwinian evolution?  ID scientists think we should not.  Obviously, ID is an inference from the evidence, not from religious scriptures or practices.So, intelligent design theory is not an argument based on what we don’t know, but rather an argument from what we do know.Defining what biological evolution is:There are three simple, but very different definitions of biological evolution.  When speaking with people about the issue it is important to ask them which definition of evolution they are using. 1)  Change over time (even billions of years, most leading ID proponents believe the universe is billions of years old)2)  Common ancestry, all forms of life evolved from a single original life form3)  Natural selection acting on random mutation is the primary mechanism by which life forms have evolved.ID scientists do not have a problem with definition #1.  There is some debate over definition #2, but it is not incompatible with ID.  Definition #3, commonly referred to as Darwinian Evolution, is a specific part of evolution that ID challenges and is the heart of Darwin’s theory.   Be sure you know what people mean when they say “evolution.”Intelligent design is not the same as creationism. Creationism is usually defined by these tenets:• The universe, energy and life were created from nothing. • The earth is young, in the range of 6,000 to 10,000 years. • Earth's geology can be explained by catastrophic events, primarily a worldwide flood.• Mutations and natural selection cannot bring about the development of all living things from a single organism.

A global flood powerful enough to carve the Grand Canyon from scratch, split one continent into seven, deposit miles of sediments... and yet four rivers remain on the surface near each other and identifiable by the same names. Just another miracle...Self consistency is not self authentication. The Bible doesn't come with a checksum.Nice avoidance of answering the question, ""How does Genesis help oil companies find oil?"" Here's the one perfect truthful book about the earth's past, and nothing in it can help a petroleum geologist??? How does assuming the Bible is literally true about a six day creation add anything to the observations of materialistic science? Every time they drill for oil, they are making a prediction about the past. When archaeologists go to a specific kind of rock to find a specific kind of fossil, as Shubin describes about Tikkalik, they are making a prediction about the past.Geology has a lot to do with evolution. We don't find plants and animals in random places in the geologic column, we find them in strata with a correlation of geolgic age and development. Plate tectonics unexplained by secular geology?? Plate tectonics IS secular geology!"

1,"  Rob Crowther Claims: According to the theory of intelligent design, certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection. This is a somewhat meaningless position, as it provides no methods to determine the how and thus cannot make a claim that it is best explained by an intelligent cause. In fact, when looking at how ID defines its approaches, it quickly becomes clear that ID lacks any positive explanation and thus lacks the support for the hypothesis that ID ""best explain[s]"".Furthermore, natural selection is not an undirected process, in fact, it is in many ways not dissimilar from 'intelligent selection', hence Darwin's appeal to breeders in furthering his argument. In both cases, choices are made and the future generation's genetic make-up changes under the processes of heritable variation and selection (whether natural or 'intelligent'). As such, without further explanations, ID has an interesting thesis but provides no way of resolving let alone providing a 'better explanation' to evolutionary theory which contains but is not limited to ""natural selection"".So does ID have a ""better explanation""? Ask yourself, how does ID propose to detect 'design', how does it propose to 'infer a designer' and how does their approach hold up in reality?1. It proposes to detect design through elimination of processes of chance or regularity. Remember that the definition of Design is the ""set theoretic complement of the disjunction chance or regularity"". While chance may need no further explanation, regularity refers to a law like process. What is important to notice is that ID is not clear if it includes 'stochastic processes' since such processes typically contain both a regularity component and a chance component (also known as noise where noise is a concept which includes 'unknown processes').This means that in order to infer 'design' ID needs to eliminate any and all known and unknown processes of chance or (and?) regularity, not a very easy task and in fact, Dembski argues that the design inference is ""useless"" if it includes false positives. Yet, we all know from history that design inferences have been inherently unreliable in cases of the ""supernatural"". So what is going on here? In case of the supernatural, we have no ways to constrain the designer and thus it can explain anything and in the end explains nothing. To understand this, realize that ""a magic pink unicorn created life last thursday"" is under such rules a plausible scenario and yet... So if we cannot constrain the explanation, ID cannot even venture to compete with our ignorance, which is basically the position when all known processes of chance or (and?) regularity have been eliminated. And yet, evolutionary theory, which deals in positive explanations does have a way to render itself as a best explanation because it can in fact compete with ""we don't know"" since it proposes positive hypotheses. ID however is not in the business of providing any explanations. And here we often see a 'bait and switch' approach in which ID argues that since 'intelligent design' can be successfully detected in such historical sciences as criminology and archaeology, it therefor must be the case that it can also be extended to include the ""supernatural"" or ""rarefied"" variant of design. This is however a misleading suggestion since in case of historical sciences, one does not rely on a fully eliminative approach and then conclude, well, we don't know how to explain this, thus design. In fact, in for instance criminology we deal with concepts of means, motives, opportunity, alibis, physical evidence, circumstantial evidence, eye witnesses etc to create a case ""beyond credible doubt"", in other words, a competing hypothesis.

2,"Andrew Holt, here's my take on your question:1. ""What is it with people like you ? was the   bible   the first book you read and then you quit reading anything else ?      Can you defend your position WITHOUT reference to the bible ?""2. ""Do you have any evidence, yes EVIDENCE, from another source that shows the bible is the word of God and not just a collection of books selected by the Vatican to support a particular viewpoint ?""My answers to your questions are: 1. Why does it matter; NO; and NO.  2. NO.    The thing with people like us, people who believe in the Word of God is that we are dealing with a subject that goes beyond human beings.  The Bible (Scriptures or Torah) Is not necessarily the first book that we have ever read, but it stands out as one of our most favorite books.  If a man (or woman) says that he loves God and believes in Him as the Center of his life, then he will not have any problem using that book to help him support his viewpoint.  By the way, the Vatican was not the only branch of Christianity to select Biblical Books and support a particular viewpoint, some Protestant denominations were also guilty of deciding which Books would remain in the Bible nearly four centuries ago.  The Jewish people are guilty of omitting several Books from the Torah (Hebrew Bible), and some of these are included in today's Catholic Apocryphal editions of both Catholic and Protestant Bibles.   One of these Books, the Book of Jasher, is an authentic Scriptural writing that many scholars believe should have remained in today's Torahs and Bibles.  So much for that, I did not come here to split hairs with anyone.  As far as evidence to show that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God, you need look no further than the Bible itself.  Since God cannot lie, why then, would the Word of God tell lies?  The Bible (and Torah) are not Vatican-selected books, no matter how much some of us may want to believe that.  In fact, the Vatican's Bible is the Christian Bible PLUS the Apocrypha, so technically speaking, the Vatican's Bible is more comprehensive than the one used by Protestants.  Go figure on that one!      "
1,"I apologise for the personal slant to the first part of my first question, it was meant to be rhetorical.From your further answer I take it that you a) have read other books.b) Have no evidence outside a single source.You say ""As far as evidence to show that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God, you need look no further than the Bible itself. Since God cannot lie, why then, would the Word of God tell lies?""That is such a naive statement that I am staggered.1. ""Since God cannot lie""  So God is not all powerful ? Surely an omnipotent deity can do anything ?2. Even if you are correct, men can lie.  A man could quite easily write a book that says this is the word of God and be lying.If I found a book describing a conflict between the Dark Lord Sauron, (who created a magical ring) and the inhabitants of middle earth.  If this book ended with ""This volume is true and was written whilst under divine inspiration of the one true God.""  Would you believe it ?"

1,"“My answers to your questions are: 1. Why does it matter; NO; and NO. 2. NO.”It is the third ‘No’ that I find most interesting.  You freely admit that you cannot defend your position without the Bible, but are in a discussion with those who do not believe that the Bible is a valid source in scientific matters.  If a religious source that cannot be supported otherwise is valid to you then what would you say to a Taoist that supports their arguments by relying on their holy texts?“If a man (or woman) says that he loves God and believes in Him as the Center of his life, then he will not have any problem using that book to help him support his viewpoint.”This is all well and good when talking among other   Christians  , but it comes across as ‘God did it’ when talking with those outside of Christiantiy.  If I said that the sun was carried across the sky in Apollo’s chariot what would you say?“By the way, the Vatican was not the only branch of Christianity to select Biblical Books and support a particular viewpoint, some Protestant denominations were also guilty of deciding which Books would remain in the Bible nearly four centuries ago.”So who has the correct collection of books?“As far as evidence to show that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God, you need look no further than the Bible itself.”If and only if you already accept the Bible as true is this a valid statement… it does not follow if you do not already accept the original statement that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God.“Since God cannot lie, why then, would the Word of God tell lies?”The Flying Spaghetti Monster does not lie, we know this because the book describing the FSM says so and since the FSM does not lie then the book is true."
1,"""Answers in Genesis"" avoids doing the one thing that might actually lead them to understand the Biblical text: studying genuine, up-to-date, Biblical scholarship that reflects a genuine desire to understand the text rather than impose one's predetermined conclusions on it.Not only is the Bible not self-authenticating, but no one comes to the Bible as a blank slate without other influences. Biblical literalism is a PR exercise. Groups like Answers in Genesis claim to believe the whole Bible and take it all literally because it persuades people who do not examine the basis for their claim. Those who do find that in fact AiG and other groups like it are making false claims. They don't take the dome in Genesis 1 literally. They never argue that one needs to believe that Yahweh created by combatting the sea monster (called Leviathan or Rahab in the Bible). Their literalism is a selective on.Moreover, Biblical scholarship has long noted that the days in Genesis 1(literal days consisting of evening and morning as per Jewish reckoning) are arranged in a poetic parallelism, with days 1-3 creating habitats that are then filled with life on days 4-6.The issue is not simply ignoring science. Answers in Genesis ignores the Bible, and yet claims to be based in the Bible. Where I come from, we call that dishonesty."

2,"Obviously you haven't done much reading on the AiG website.  They often cite Hebrew scholars, have documented beliefs about Genesis during various times in church history, and address what you refer to as ""Biblical scholarship.""  Their website has a great search engine for anyone who really cares to find out.AiG promotes a straight forward reading of the Bible.  History (which includes Genesis 1-11) is read as history and poetry is read as poetry.  This is very natural for most people unless they have a problem with the straight forward comments.  No English translation I have used mentions a dome in Genesis 1, although the topic is discussed on their site at   http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v13/i2/firmament.asp  .There are many ways in which the Bible is self-authenticating.  The consistency of the message (e.g. man's lostness and need for a savior), the numerous fulfilled prophecies, the multiple eyewitnesses of Christ's resurrection (who stuck by the truth of their testimony even when faced with death), and the fact that it is consistent with real life.  In the last respect, the awesome design in nature and the Bible's wisdom in human relationships are what I found most convincing.  For example, God commands that we forgive, but this makes no sense if God is not our Creator to whom we must give an account.  In psychology they have found out that forgiveness is very important to our well being.  There are other truths the Bible presents that science is catching up with too.You have failed to engage the arguments presented by AiG and failed to demonstrate that they ignore the Bible or science.

1,"2. So far, many people have yet to realize that the concept of 'design' as defined by ID is actually quite limited. In fact, few seem to be familiar with the major concessions made by William Dembski.--Before I proceed, however, I note that Dembski makes an important concession to his critics. He refuses to make the second assumption noted above. When the EF implies that certain systems are intelligently designed, Dembski does not think it follows that there is some intelligent designer or other. He says that, ""even though in practice inferring design is the first step in identifying an intelligent agent, taken by itself  design does not require that such an agent be posited. The notion of design that emerges from the design inference must not be confused with intelligent agency"" (TDI, 227). --Source: Ryan Nichols, The Vacuity of Intelligent Design Theory (TDI: The Design Inference, William Dembski)In other words, design does not imply designer, and in fact, as people such as Wesley Elsberry have shown, Intelligent Design cannot even exclude natural selection as a 'designer'.Crowther then continues to confuse the terminology of 'complexity and information' while ignoring that science has  shown  how processes of regularity and chance can in principle explain complexity and information, and thus ID, which lacks its own positive explanations cannot even compare it to scientific explanations.And that my friends, is the rest of the story."
1,"The first problem with the debate question is that neither time nor space exists per se.  Then comes the definition of units of time, such as “a day.”  Neither of these points was apparent in earlier times when the myths date from.  But even though it is also still true that science most probably does not have clear or even close answers in cosmology today (the big bang theory works pretty good, but the big splat theory has not been eliminated, and then there is understanding dark matter and dark energy and there possible implications) it does not mean that any theory or myth is as valid as any other.Using biblical myths as anything other than analogies is disrespectful of religion and reduces its potential value to society.  At the vary lest it make religion unnecessarily subject to discrediting and rejection when science proves here to fore believed “facts” unlikely, improbable or just plain wrong."
1,"""One of the major problems that we all have (in fact, it’s the same problem Adam and Eve had in the Garden of Eden) is that we tend to start from outside God's Word and then go to what God has written in the Bible (or—in Adam's case—what God forbade him to do) to try to interpret it on the basis of our own pre-set ideas. This is the major reason why most people question the length of the days of creation in the book of Genesis.""Objection! Assumes facts not in evidence, including the claim that the Bible is the Word of God. It is dishonest to claim that those who reject or even question the Bible's dogmas are doing so because of ""pre-set ideas"". A common fallacy of bigots is to claim that their opponents are also bigoted. This is a smokescreen.""If the Bible is the inspired Word of the infinite Creator God, then it must be self-authenticating and self-attesting—and it is. At the same time, my presupposition is that we should start with what God's Word says regardless of outside ideas, for only God's Word is infallible.""Nonsense! NOTHING is self-authenticating. You would never say anything else was, so why make an exception for the Bible? Especially considering the existence of other religious texts, most of whom you would DENY because of your faith in the Bible. And the followers of other faiths, in turn, would deny the Bible because of THEIR faith. ""If people doubt the length of the days of creation when the language of the Bible speaks so plainly that they are regular days, then they are accepting a particular approach to all of Scripture. Why shouldn't they then start to doubt that Christ's Virgin Birth really means a virgin birth? Why shouldn't people start to doubt that the Resurrection really means resurrection?""There is clear evidence for a universe and Earth billions of years old and for the evolution of life and thus good reason to deny a literal reading of the Genesis creation stories. There is no evidence to outright deny the Virgin Birth of Christ or His Resurrection. Those who put their faith in Genesis more than in Jesus have no business calling themselves Christians."

1,"I do not 'believe' in science.  I see it as a rational way to understand the world.  I do not believe that if I drop a pencil that it will fall, I just know that according to gravitational theories that if I hold a pencil up then let go that it will be pulled towards the largest concentration of mass (which happens to be the earth).If I did hold up a pencil, let it go, and it did not fall then that would not change my beliefs... I'd just examine the situation to see what was keeping it from acting as expected.  My beliefs do not enter into it.It's the same for the current scientifically accepted theories about the origins of the earth.  I've read through the theories and the evidence, and I agree with the common consensus about the age and creation of the earth.You believe in Biblical Genesis, but I've yet to see any evidence to support it... or to give it more credence then the Egyptian, Native American, or Viking creation stories.You state that everyone lies, but then go on to say that you trust one group of scribes out of all the others.  How does their mathematical system lead to near perfect records?"
2,All this is hard to understand.  I was once where you are at.  I did not believe any of it.  I found myself wrong on everything.  The truth is not something man has much of in his nature.  What man has not lied once or twice?

Coincidentally, negative proof is a rather tricky thing.  Saying that something is true because there is no proof that it is false is a logical fallacy...

""Why would God take 4.5 billion years..."" is also not a scientific argument, its not really any sort of argument.  The evidence, as presented (astronomical, geological, archeological) all points back past 6k years, what is the evidence that contradicts this?"

1,"after the entire cain and able thing, the brother left to another group of people to find a wife....but a litteral reading of the bible does not allow there to be other people.  this is because in my opinion every religion's creation story is the creation story of THEIR people.  If a people live on an island with a volcano you can be certain fire and lava will be given as evidence of their God's expression.  If their cculture tells it's own story from an austere desert, you may be certain that it's laws from God will reflect the severity of the conditions around them.  The Egyptian's Gods demonstrated cyclicalness in every aspect of their human discription as the Nile's cyclical swelling was THE essence of their survival.In the same manner, religions can become mutated by it's authors.  God takes on the behavior of a Ceasar once Ceasar co-opted the bible.  Popes read into the Bible and extend the reality of the narrative's interpretation in ways that resemble exactly how history sees them.  If a pope was self agrandizing and greedy for power, God become increasingly so.Read a little anthropology and one quickly realises that the devil as described by each in the Bible reflects EXACTLY the specific negatives being experienced by those who are believed to have actually penned each of the gospels at the time such things, by all evidence available, were first commited to paper.  If the evil the group faced was a persecutorial leader....then the qualities of the devil described by them resemble the cruelty of the leader.  if the advesary was a cultural bias against the gospel sources group, the details of evil resemble this.On several side notes; If Jesus agreed with all of God's laws then he HAD to kill the adultress rather than get away with the ""let he who is without sin"" thing.  If this were an example to follow, we should enact NO judgement on anyone.  except the Bible does not allow us to ignore it's laws, so we MUST stone people as prescribed....right?If God told Adam and Eve not to eat of the apple, he would have had to have imparted to them the seriousness of doing so and the concequences.  but they did not know of right and wrong yet.  how could they have known that eating the apple was wrong?  A threat of pain?  pain was something they never knew.we have free will right?  it is not free will if we are threatened with damnation.  that is extortion.The story of creation, man inparticular is best read as insight the authors found, divine or not.  what we do know from personal experience is that Man at some point in our   evolution  , divinely guided or not, is most different from the animals because we ARE capable of harming needlessly, doing things which are short sighted, eating crud, making and then inhaling smog....we are no longer biological robots, mating when spring arrives, migrating when the sun gets lower and lower in the sky. If god is perfect then why did he let the devil loose on man?  If God has a plan and knows evrything why do so many people feel they have the right to doubt Gods plan by asking for things?  Anything!  This description of God is either one of a selfish Ceasar like God where we should beg and plead but he will doe as he wishes anyway and we should be thankful no matter the turn of events or people are wrong in their actions and prayer should be for thanks and appology only. God is more than humans can comprehend.  No two persons experience the divine the same even if they are of the same faith and subsect of that faith.  All that we can know about evil is that it is experienced by us as that which destroys Life.  Life as we know it is not simply whether something is breathing, it is the ability to unfold, continue to express.  Be it a spieces becoming another over time or a person being allowed to find his or her self....to have options in this existance open.  Suppression of Life are seen in poverty, shame created by a selfish culture, war, greed, violence  All anyone can say for certain if they believe in God is that God creates.  That is all we can see for certain from this side of the screen.  "
1,"AiG argues that pretexts brought by the reader are to blame for difficulties accepting The Bible as literal truth.  But, since The Bible is rendered as a text written in human language, it cannot be entirely self-authenticating.  The reader must bring at least her understanding of that language in order to be able to interpret the printed word.  Every reading of The Bible is colored the reader's understanding of the language, not to mention by the translator's abilities and proclivities in preparing the particular edition being read.  Therefore, everyone who reads The Bible (or anything else, for that matter) must necessarily project a bit of themselves, including their prejudices, into the narrative.AiG may have been trying to say that, rather than finding the flaws, one should strain to hear the truth in the scripture.  But this particular argument, proceeding as it does from an absurd premise, does not hold up."

The current estimate of the age of the universe is totally in accord with this minimal assuption.True, the universe could be insane. This is one of the questions posed by Rene Descartes in his 1644 work, Principles of Philosophy (Principia philosophiae). I find that Descartes was congruent with the Bible that the universe is indeed coherent."
1,"The absence of a creator is not an assumption of the sciences. Scientists almost always rely upon methodological naturalism, the assumption that explanations of observable effects are most useful when they describe specific (natural) mechanisms. This has worked well so far, but nothing in the scientific method precludes supernatural explanations if the observations warrant it.Scientists gave intelligent design a fair chance. Once upon a time, intelligent design did made a prediction that we could measure and verify. It predicted that life would have ""irreducibly complex"" structures that could not have evolved by natural selection acting upon a series of advantageous mutations. Several candidates of irreducibly complex structures were suggested, and scientists took a careful look at each. Not one turned out to be irreducibly complex.That's worth repeating: No biological structure is known to be irreducibly complex.This is why intelligent design was rejected. It made predictions that further investigation found to be false. The vast majority of scientific ideas die this way; it's okay. The only unscientific feature of modern intelligent design is the unwillingness of many to abandon it in light of these new observations."

1,"The notion that science ""assume{s} that their(sic) is no creator and then prove it"" is plainly ridiculous.By ""consistant"" we mean that the behavior of the universe cannot vary without some physical manifestation. By rational we mean that the order of the universe is discernable.

If we somehow observed an area of the earth where gravity was reversed then a scientific investigation would have to demonstrate what conditions 'there' caused gravity to be reversed.  That would either make the observation in line with current scientific thinking (a powerful magnetic field giving the appearance of reversed gravity) or lead to an expansion of existing theories to describe anti-gravity.The first step is to observe something that does not appear to fit within current scientific knowledge, and so far the observed laws appear to be universal in scope.Saying that they might not be, but that we have not observed where they are inconsistent is not a scientific argument.

1,"Intelligent design might be a seasoned exercise in rationalization, but the claim that it is a ""science"" cannot be supported.  If anything can be said to characterize science, it is a profound skepticism and hard-nosed objectivity in seeking to disprove conjectures, ruling out all other possibilities before making any claim of finding ""the truth"".  By contrast, Intelligent Design seeks only to rationalized the observable world with the belief in an intelligent creator.  Devotees of Intelligent Design may be intelligent, rational, disciplined thinkers, but they are not doing science."

They put to words what they believe was the revealed word of their God and was they were ALREADY practicing as a tribe.Fact, the Hebrew people were concerned about God's laws, not about science. The purpose of the Bible is man's salvation not a science text book. I believe both camps enfringe. Science is the study of the universe's physical processes, NOT origins. The ""Creationists"" shouldn't look to the Bible for scientific or Historic absolutes. Ex. nowhere is it claimed that Moses personally wrote the Torah but as was the custome of the day he was the likely author with scribes putting his words to the written form.    "

People taking them literally miss the authors' intent. "

1,If the existence of a fossil record contradicting parts of the Bible then that does not disprove (in and of itself) the fossil record.  It would have to be challenged on it's own ground (such a an explanation of why the record dates are incorrect and a verifiable explanation for the fossil records existence).
1,"It is indeed spiritually immature to equate death and decay with evil. Without death, reproduction would not be necessary, and without reproduction, natural selection could not improve a species over time. And without decay, nutrients in once living things could not be returned to the soil to replenish it and enable plants to grow. That's why the depiction of life prior to the Fall of Man, with no animals dying and all of them being vegetarian, is ludicrous. Within a few years, the cycle of life would grind to a halt because the animals would have eaten all the plants and the world would have been in a static state forever. God told the animals and people, even before the Fall, to ""be fruitful and multiply"". That would quickly end once all the plants were eaten.If the gospel message is dependent on the Genesis myths, we are better off without it. Fortunately, no one has to be that narrow minded or irrational. The problem of sin among human beings would remain even if Genesis had never been written.BTW, the Jews, whose ancestors wrote the Bible, do not beleive in Original Sin. So why should we?"
1,"The Earth is not billions of years old because that would mean your ancient holy book and everything you believe in would be wrong?I'm sorry but this took SERIOUS cahones to write as a defense of your beliefs.

1,"Good point, but as an evolutionary biologist I find that not entirely true. And as a matter of fact, several sciences from anthropology to zoology via psychiatry and neurology do tell us a lot about ourselves. But even more so does what we study, and the drive to study in itself. Besides, I have doubts about the ""intents"" of the authors of at least some myths being more sophisticated than representing fact as they believed it. That being said, I certainly agree that they do say a lot about our basic human nature."
1,"All AiG is showing is that the author of one part of the Bible took the author of another part of the Bible literally, not that either one knew what they were talking about. What if the Hebrews had a seven day week and wrote the text to justify and sanctify existing practice?AiG's argument is no more sophisticated than ""I'm right because I think I'm right."""
1,"Of all of AIG's silliness, I think this one is the winner."
2,"I believe that the 6-day Creation of the Universe as we know it today has to be taken literally, even though Scripture does say that one day in the eyes of the Heavenly Father is like a thousand years.  The first verse in Gensis says that ""God created the heavens and the earth,"" which means that yes, the Earth has been around for millions of years, a verification of rock samples and other geological data that concludes the Earth has been around for millions of years.  At some point within those millions of years, God decided to transform a lifeless Earth into a life-giving planet while at the same time He was creating time, outer space, the galaxies, stars, our Milky Way and Solar System, the Earth's moon, the presence of evening, day, and night on Earth, and all of the living things to grow and roam on the planet.  As the previous poster had mentioned, the significance of the 7-day week would be useless if we decided not to  interpret literally the Genesis Creation story.  If he did not take 7 literal days to create the Universe as we know it today, then He would have no reason to bless the seventh day and set it apart.   Everything else in Scripture, I believe that we are free to interpret it as we wish.  But if we are dealing with a highly-intelligent Being who can separate the waters of the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans at will, then why would we question or doubt that He could create our mortal Universe in six days flat?     "
1,"If the seven-day week is relevant, shouldn't the names of the days be relevant as well? Specifically the days named after pagan Gods--Odin's day, Thor's Day, Freya's Day, etc. Would God have built a pattern of idolatry into something that significant?"
2,"Human beings added names to the days of week, they were originally and simply numbers.  The first day, the second day, the third day, and so forth.  No, God did not place elements of idolatry into His days (or anything else, for that matter).  I believe that when people take out the supernatural aspect of this issue, then we might as well give all the credit to men, many of whom always seem to know more than our Heavenly Father.   I say let's stop trying to rationalize everything in God's creations and allow Him some of the honor."
1,Why should we just stop?  Why not keep trying to understand the universe?  I could never imagine being satisfied with a 'God did it'.
2,"There are some things human beings were not meant to understand because the God who created this Universe is a Being who is greater than all of His Creation.  I am not here to argue Scripture on God because the Bible tells us that the man who lacks wisdom says that there is no God (Psalm 14, Verse 1).  I believe that it's a good thing to want to know more about our Universe, but the Universe we need to focus on is our personal Universe, Planet Earth.  We encounter galaxies of people every day, on the street, at work, in our neighborhoods, and on the streets and highways.  Some of them are homeless, poor, needy, lonely, or just plain everyday people who could benefit from a smile or kind word and deed.  The stars are thousands and millions of light years away, but many of the Earth's 7 billion people are only minutes away from us.  Yes, God did create the Universe and more.  He also allowed us the opportunity to live among other people, so that we could share ourselves with our fellow men and women, and make a difference in their lives.   I will not deny the existence of a supernatural Being greater than myself, because none of us made the choice to be born.  This was something that happened without our consent - I don't need to prove the existence of God because I am not here to split hairs with other people.  But until we can definitely prove that God does not exist, then I would consider it useless to debate on the subject.  As one preacher said: ""The unbelievers don't believe in God until they find themselves in a disaster and at the brink of death.""   Death is such a powerful thing, that it has motivated such people to get down on their knees and pray to the very same God that they say they don't believe in!   God is real - the proof is all over the Earth and around you, evening, morning, day and night.    "
1,"What proof can you offer that right now we have reached the maximum limit of human knowledge?  Why is it at this moment that nothing more should be known, why not 100 years ago, or 100 years from now?""I am not here to argue Scripture on God because the Bible tells us that the man who lacks wisdom says that there is no God (Psalm 14, Verse 1)""You do realize that quoting from the Bible only works when you are talking with Christians... and I've met more then a few people that I would count as wise who were not Christians.""The unbelievers don't believe in God until they find themselves in a disaster and at the brink of death.""The old 'no   atheists   in foxholes' bit?  I think that the Military Association of Atheists and Free Thinkers would disagree with you on that bit."
2,"I am not an atheist, and have no reason to debate with anyone concerning an Eternal Being who is greater than any of us.  ""He who entertains a scoffer will do so to his sorrow, and the father of one who lacks wisdom has no joy (Proverbs 17:21).""  You have your beliefs, and I have mine.  I have given you my respect - therefore, we would never reach a common ground on the reality of the existence of God, which in my book, is a no-brainer.  "
1,"AIG doesn't believe the geological data. They believe the world is a little over 6,000 years old!!"
1,"and could predict the next one, there would still be the question of why it was set up that way. You can never answer that. The evolutionary track, while useful, is blocked by time. It can never reveal the why either. Those are the questions each of us must come to terms with, if not answer, for ourselves. Religion does provide a framework for many people. A more interesting thought for me is that in Buddhism, the question itself is considered irrelevant. It's not whether there is a God, or any issue of theology that resonates, but how do I adjust myself?"
1,"There are some answers in there.Why am I so distrustful of snakes?AIG's got that.What's the biggest I could build a boat without irritating G-d?AIG's got that.How old is the earth?Mmmmmehhhh.See, the 6000 year number is a calculation made by a guy named Usherr. I almost feel bad about criticizing it because it was a massive amount of time, effort and brilliance that the guy put into it. This was a   labor   of love. But we have to at least be consistent. They keep saying ""Scientists could be wrong"". Well...Bishop Usher could be wrong. Very, very wrong."
1,"Usher got a bad rap. He wasn't trying to find out how old the world was, he wanted to compare the Bible chronology with other historical chronologies to see where the Bible fit into history. Some other literalist took it and decided the world was created in 4004BC and Usher got the blame."
1,Well once you accept the existence of an all powerful deity then anything is possible... The same can be said for invisible gnomes building everything.However for those who do see no evidence for a divine being (or invisible gnomes) see no reason to presume that the world was created in six days... indeed the evidence is quite strongly pointing in another direction.
1,"AiG decries scientists for making ""unproven assumptions"" while making many of their own. The most significant are the following claims.1. The Bible is infallible2. AiG correctly understands the BibleBoth of these have not been demonstrated by AiG and are, in fact, not provable. The Bible is rife with vague messages and contradictory passages. Only by the special pleading of organizations like AiG do these passages form a coherent whole, yet the truths AiG found in the Bible are wholly inconsistent with the reality of the world around us. What reason do we have then to trust AiG's interpretations of Biblical passages?Scientists has proven beyond any reasonable scientific doubt that our planet is billions of years old. If scientists were making bad assumptions, we would expect independent dating methods to give us wildly conflicting results, yet independent dating methods all agree. There is currently no scientific dissent whatsoever in favor of a significantly younger earth.I highly suggest the following article for any Christian with concerns over the reliability of radiometric dating methods.   http://www.asa3.org/ASA/RESOURCES/WIENS.html   "
1,"""You are ignoring centuries of good scholarship, including that in the last century specifically engaging the arguments of Historical criticism and so-called 'higher' reasoning.""No, I'm not. I've read both. I find the historical criticism approach more palatable, but it still seems like a lot of over-analysis of ancient mythology to me.""Might it not depend on where in the universe you are taking your readings?""No, because isotope decay occurs at a predictable rate. If an observer were exploiting a relativistic effect to make the Earth appear younger in his own frame of reference, then he would also see that time itself was passing proportionally faster on the Earth. Our planet has been here for at least 4.5 billion years, measuring from the planet's own frame of reference."
1,"""The scripture is silent as to which locale in the spacetime continuum, the Author of the account was measuring time from on the first day of creation.""Are you sure? Take a look at Genesis 1:2. If you must insist on forcing the narrative into a ""materialist straight jacket,"" as Dr. Hurd described it, then it certainly does not appear that the observer was at a great distance. The passage states that god's spirit was hovering over the oceans, and presumably god was the observer.""Even now, the age of the earth, by whatever scientific determination, assumes an eathly observer, and does does not generally take into acount that an observer from Betelgeuse disagrees with this age.""Any observer in the known universe would have similar estimates for the age of our planet. An observer on Betelgeuse could make a crude estimate of the earth's age by comparing our sun with other main sequence stars. Furthermore, they could precisely measure the rate at which time passes here by running light from our star through a spectrometer. If our planet were positioned in a gravitational field such that 4.5 billion years here would appear as 6 days to someone else, then they would find light from our star to be dramatically redshifted.Incidentally, if we were positioned in such a gravitational field, we would expect all starlight outside that field to be dramatically blueshifted. That is not consistent with observations of the heavens above us."
1,"""One thing for sure, time was and continues to be passing differently in different parts of the universe. From whose perspective is the universe 14.2 billion years?""Time does pass at different rates at different locations, but that variance follows very specific mathematical equations. The Lorentz transformation converts between two reference frames traveling at a constant relative velocity. Similar transformations exist for gravitational time dilation. (See the Schwarzschild metric.) My point being: You cannot manipulate time as you please to suit your interpretation of the Bible. Unless you wish to confine god the observer to the center of a black hole, the observable universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old as measured from most frames of reference therein.""Please clarify how this negates relativity.""It doesn't negate relativity; my example was derived from it. But first I must apologize, as I had my examples reversed. In an attempt to explain distant starlight on a young earth, creationists sometimes argue that the earth must be at the center of a massive gravitational field. This light would be blue shifted. The reverse is true in your case: We would expect dramatic redshift from any location in the universe where god supposedly made his observations of a 144-hour creation."
1,But what have ancient scriptures ultimately proven?
1,"include the transmission of the Biblical text. AiG's argument rests on accepting the text is perfect and their understanding is perfect.I'd rather go with the ""fallible"" apparent age of the Universe given by cosmic background radiation and recesion of galaxies than the errors that accumulate in a human book."
2,"Using logic to apply consistent artistry to the mass of Creation, we may assert the existence of The Artist, Almighty God!  If we exercise faith toward God, by believing that He exists in the very manner that He says that he does, then we may logically apply His consistent Character, including His Artistic Signature in Creation, to all things that God, the Artist, creates.  If we believe that Adam was created by God as The Bible asserts, then we may, also, presuppose that Adam was not created as an infant since, of course, there would have been no other humans avaliable to have cared for the needs of an infant.The obvious need for Adam to be self-sufficient (along with the need for verbal communication with God during daily walks in the Garden of Eden, and enough creative intelligence to name all of the animals) would imply that Adam's creation required ""apparent age.""Using other words, on the day that Adam was created, his ""apparent age"" could have been anywhere from 13 to 30 years of age.Though these numbers may seem arbitrary, there is precedence for this range.  In various cultures around the world, a boy receives a rite of passage into manhood about the age of puberty.  In Judaism, the Bar Mitzvah marks the beginning of a man's participation in the Law of God as a ""Son of the Covenant."" Also, in the Jewish nation (it is my understanding,) that 30 years of age marks full maturity and the right to lead (if wise, as well) in the community of faith.To relate this information to the literal Six Days of Creation, (and the lack of the allegedly millions of years of evolutionary development,) is a simple matter of applied logic.If your world view can allow for the existence of apparent age in the creation of Adam (for multiple valid and utilitarian reasons,) then your world view can allow for the plausibility of the Earth being created with the appearance of having existed already for millions of years as well as having been created by The Omnipotent God in SIX literal DAYS!  :)"
1,While that is an interesting question it is hardly a scientific one... and the theory of ID is billed as   science   not philosophy.
1,"Your argument breaks down if your audience rejects the notion that Adam was created ex nihilo with the ""appearance of age."" Did Adam have liver spots? Scars? Any accumulation of chemical byproducts? A belly button? Memories of childhood? These are all not just signs of maturity but also signs of specific events that occurred in the past. Would it not be deceptive for god to create something with the artifacts of a fake history?Our planet and our universe are littered with artifacts of specific events occurring before six thousand years ago."
2,"With all due respects, here is my Bottom Line, though I run the risk of being arrogan and ""closed-minded,"" I only write for the Judeo-Christian World View.  This is mainly due to a time-factor...I only have one life on Earth in which to learn.  Therefore, I don't have time to explore any other world views because there is still so much for me to learn from this one.Your point is well-taken.  My applied logic only works for those who see the world as I do...However, I will address a couple of your concerns.First, since it is impossible for God to sin, God would never be deceptive.  Yet, THAT once given, we may now turn our attention to humans who do something similar.  It is openly taught on HGTV!It's the creation of faux surfaces, like faux rust and faux marble.  For our discussion faux rust is the most germaine.  These artists create rust and various apparently aged surfaces through chemical processes that could be expected to leave various types of residue.If The LORD chose to do something, like that, He could do an infinitely better job than we humans can.My point in my original comment was not to state some superior knowledge, but to explore a probable hypothesis that explains logically (at least to my mind) how the world works.Thanks for just a little room for letting a guy ""think out-loud.""  :)"
1,"""Therefore, I don't have time to explore any other world views""In other words, religion is easy and science is hard.  So you choose religion and ignore science."
1,"scientific evidence do you need? I mean, we've got writing from before 4000 years ago, evidence of mankind's making things over 10,000 years old. "
1,"Speaking as a non-Christian, this argument that the days of creation could not be allegorical simply because the author used an ordinal and the phrase ""evening and morning"" is juvenile and unconvincing. Furthermore, big bang cosmology is not a necessary component of evolutionary theory in the Darwinian sense, yet AiG continues to conflate the two, much to the frustration of anyone who understands the difference.If the fossil record isn't what it appears to be and AiG can demonstrate it, the scientists will listen. AiG should publish a compelling alternative hypothesis that better explains all observations. If the fossil record and all the death therein was indeed deposited within human history, why are there no mammals except the upper layers? How did layers of denser rock form above layers of light rock? These are just two of many very real and easily verifiable observations that traditional geology and evolutionary theory explains better than AiG geology.This left me wondering about the motivation of organizations like AiG. Are they reaching out to non-Christians? If so, these childish arguments are the wrong approach. Are they defending cherished beliefs in the face of more progressive believers? If so, AiG needs to pick their battles more wisely. The evidence for an ancient earth is overwhelming. Everyone should be willing to accept the possibility that a cherished belief like ""original sin"" may be superfluous, unnecessary, and incorrect."
1,"If you believe in god (which one?) and god gave you the brains to think, then use your brains and follow the evidence.The universe is around 13.7 billion years old, our planet is about 4.7 billion years old, our current human species is somewhere around 150,000 years old.Very primitive books written by humans for humans in the region of the world that around the current Israel that record how these primitive people viewed the universe is nothing more than interesting history.Be aware that while these primitive books were written, highly sophisticated societies existed in other places of the world.The reality is that we do not need a god to explain anything all the way to the big bang.Here is an example of primitive thinking (as in lack of reasoning) that many apologists use:1. The sun goes up in the morning2. I can hear the cock crow every day before the sun comes up3. It is the cock who makes the sun come up in the morning, no need to think anymorePlease use your brains, even if you think they are god given..."
1,"""Evolutionary theories (the “big bang” hypothesis, for instance)""The Big Bang Theory is not an ""evolutionary theory."" Please learn about the things you attempt to talk about.It's ridiculous that you are considered, ""Expert Verified,"" when you try to use a misleading and false blanket term like ""evolutionary theories."""
2,"I think you hit the nail on the head here.  This entire argument is based on our limitations AND projections.  Why do we have to be so arrogant as to think we could understand creation, or any of God's other activities, purposes, or ways?  Romans 1 tells us that God reveals aspects of his divine nature--We witness the evidence, not necessarily comprehend it.My basic problem with ""science"" on these matters is that it is not true science.  Agendas are littered about."
1,"""My basic problem with ""science"" on these matters is that it is not true science.""I don't think you are qualified to be the arbiter of ""true science"".  :-)"
2,"Agreed, 100 percent!  This is my frustration with people who want to find every possible motive to discredit Creationism, they seem to want everyone to accept their viewpoints without question while they seemingly want to question and discredit anyone who does not see from their points of view.  There are a number of people within the scientific community who say that the Biblical account of Creation can be verified, regardless of how many days it took to be accomplished.  I believe in the 6-day Creation because our Heavenly Father is a perfect Being who can speak things into existence, He does not even have to raise a finger.  Man did not exist for millions and billions of years, but the heavens and the Earth were around that long.  As Scripture says, God is not man and His ways are not our ways.  It is fruitless and futile, in my opinion, for us, such plain and frail mortal beings, to analyze supernatural events that are way beyond human thought and rationalize a supernatural Being into such minuscule humanity, a God who is bigger and more powerful than the Solar System and Milky Way that He created.  ""Vanity,"" says the preacher in Ecclesiastes, ""Everything is vanity.""          "
1,"The the myths and stories of the Bible were never meant to be taken as history in our sense of the word, and certainly not   science  . The physical record is overwhelming for   evolution  . Besides, I would HATE to think that there was divine being to blame for things like cancers, birth defects, and the poor design of human teeth. There are questions for which   religion  /philosophy/spirituality has no answers just as there are questions which are irrelevant to science. But both are important in terms of coming to terms with ourselves. "
1,God created the universe therefore God created   science  . If science is a lie then God is a liar. Scientist have shown that the world was not created in six days. If you except the day age theory God and science agree and science has to explain how the writer of Genesis knew that plants came before the sun appeared in the sky.
2,"Once again we are attempting to split hairs over things that are beyond the frailty of the human brain. Creation as explained in the Scriptures is not a lie, true   science   has already confirmed what Scripture has explained.  I will not split hairs with people over issues that are not worthy of divisive debate, such as the validity of science and the accuracy of the Bible.  We are not God, God does not lie, and some things are better left alone, especially when people are seeking to disprove the existence of God.   "
1,I am not disputing God and I hardly think the difference between a day and a billion years or so is splitting hairs. This is a valid discussion between two creationist groups. My question would be what scientific evidence is there that the world could have been created in six days?
2,"Mike, my apologies to you, but I am surprised at the numbers of people here who appear to be somewhat hostile towards the existence of a Supreme Being, namely God, Yahweh, Yahwah, YHWH, The I Am That I Am, and so forth.  This is not a question, but if we are dealing with a Highly Intelligent Being who created everything that we hear, taste, see and feel, then why must we question the possibility that He may have precisely created the present Universe in six days, Hebrew etymology aside?  I believe that there are some things that we were not meant to completely understand, and this happens to be one of them.  Why can't we just be content in knowing that God created our present Universe and world in a series of 1-2-3-4-5-6 and rested on 7.  It doesn't matter if the Creation happened in 6 days or 6 millennia, but I always choose the former.  There are many passages in the Bible that are quite literal, so it could be a fact that the Universe as we know it was indeed created in six days.  Again, this is what I call the hair-splitting approach: Like the disciple Thomas, we demand to justify everything, including the supernatural, unless we can see it ourselves.  If you believe in God as I do, then some things we must accept because of our faith, any presence of doubt will show our absence of faith.   There are simply some things that we will never be able to explain because they are far beyond the frailty of the human mind.   No matter how hard people try, there will always be things that human beings will never be able to explain."
1,We have two different literal interpretations. One agrees with   science   the other doesn't.  It seems more logical to take the literal interpretation that agrees with both. The added advantage is that with the old age interpretation non-believers have to deal with the fact that Genesis I is far more accurate then should be possible. They wrote things that they could not possibly known. 
1,"Abraham, Isaac and Jacob belonged to different tribes and were not related, but the stories grew together into a collection and the persons were tied together as members of the same family. Isaac became son of Abraham, with Esau and Jacob becoming Isaac’s sons.  And Jacob became equipped with twelve sons, so the twelve tribes should be equal.Into this storytelling old adventure stories also were incorporated, and they were told as being as credible as the heroic epics. The motif in the story about Joseph and the wife of Potiphar for instance is copied from the Egyptian fairytale “The two Brothers”.  Of old an enmity existed between the semi-nomadic sheepherders and the Bedouins. In the production of myths, the sheepherders therefore made a story about how the Bedouins were descendants of a farmer that had fled because of murdering his brother. We recognize the story about Cain and Abel. They then equipped Adam and Eve with a third son, Set, who was made god-fearing and straight enough to be the one they themselves descended from.In Canaan, drought was the enemy; high summer was the death of nature. But with autumn the rains came, and nature awakened to life again.  The creation myth of the Canaanites therefore speaks of the dry, arid land that their God bless with rain and wells breaking forth. Thus life was created on Earth. Contrary to that, in Babylon floods were the dangerous problem.Their creation myth, that also became known by the Israelites and incorporated into their folklore, therefore tells that it began with waters all over, then with land rising out of the water. The two creation myths are placed side by side in the bible and they are both equally true and believable.Most likely, people in those times believed those stories as more than just stories. For them, it was real history that earth and heavens, man and animals suddenly were created. They were aware of the existence of other peoples with other gods, but they were not part of their own history and how they might have been created was of no concern to them. So therefore, there was no problem for Cain to find a wife. Most of the myths in Genesis are older than the immigration of the Israelites. They had been part of the tribal traditions for a long time. Their concept of God also was quite different. The patriarchs knew gods like El-sjaddai and Elohim, and neither Abram, Isaac or Jacob knew anything about Moses’ new creation, Yahweh. According to 2. Mos. 3, Moses asked the new god what he should be called, and the god replied: “I am who I am.” The story leaves no doubt that it is a new, hitherto unknown god that is being introduced, but history has made him identical with the god of the patriarch’s. While they had been more like family- or tribal gods, this new god was made the god of the Israeli nation, and theirs only. And in later history telling he became the god of the ancient myths and fairytales."
2,"I am a strong believer in the authority and inspiration of the word of God. But I do wonder about Genesis and how it refers to no bush or vegetation were around when God decided to make Adam. This is confusing considering land and vegetation was made on day 3 and man on day 6. Does the hebrew transfer it differently? Is there possiblity that since Moses was the writer it was not a first hand account and things were not perfectly clear, similar to Revelations?Again, the fact that we do not know I believe only gives more power to God and is a reminder we are finite and know very little."
1,"""the fact that we do not know I believe only gives more power to God""YES!  Our ignorance proves that there is a GOD!  or maybe not.We have come pretty far in the last thousand years - come back in ten thousand years and see if we have learned a little bit more."
1,"Imagine you found a grain of rice and you wanted to measure its length. Of a caliper, meter stick, and odometer, which instrument would you use? If by some stretch of incompetence you opted to use the odometer, you might conclude that our length measurement techniques are wildly inaccurate. How else could a grain of rice have a length of 0.001 kilometers?This is the same technique that AiG's ""PhD scientists"" use to cast doubt on radiometric dating methods. The isotope potassium-40 decays with a half life of 1.25 billion years, so it isn't appropriate for measuring very young volcanic rocks. The margin of error with that technique is millions of years wide. Likewise, carbon-14 decays with a half-life of 5730 years, making it accurate only up to about 10 half-lives, or about 60,000 years. Past that point, the remaining carbon-14 is far too scarce to make any accurate age measurement. Yet AiG's professionals admit to using this approach to date diamonds? Incomprehensible.As for the salinity of the oceans, AiG fails to consider any process that removes salt from seawater, of which many have been examined and documented. A full analysis will show that the salinity of the ocean is in equilibrium. The amount of salt entering the sea is almost exactly equal to the amount being removed."
1,"Calling the ort cloud a ""guess"" is disingenuous at best. While no direct observational data confirms its existence, the statistically unlikely clustering of the aphelia (the furthest point in orbit away from the sun) of long period comets strongly imply its existence. And of course, most short period comets, the ones that matter to AiG's calculations, come from the Kuiper belt, which we have directly observed. "
2,"  This will and is already descending into a debate about the philosophy of science.   The anti ID crowd will insist on a strict materialistic cause and effect definition of science. Falsely assuming creators or a Creator, can not be scientifically known. Meanwhile, hypocritically saying they can know the origins, without adhering to the scientific method.   The anti ID's have stolen science as their private domain, to be used only, to promote their views of the Universe. A view that insist upon a, no Creator (filter). To be put on first, by all scientist. They are entrenched and defending their hold on science, furiously.   This isn't progressive science. It is holding to an old order that only wants to use science to discover advances that serve the status quo. But does not want to discover anything that would threating that status quo.   Real science and scientist should be free from this tyranny. Free to (follow the evidence, where ever it leads, and to what ever conclusions, bringsmore enlightenment.)  Materialist would hold us back in the, present scientific, ""dark ages"". Where mankind is still crawling on hands and knees. Taking two steps backward for every step forward.   Set the scientist free. Embrace ID.  "
1,"The scientific investigation into the question of the age of the Earth, and of the universe has been going on for hundreds of years. For the past two centuries, and with accelerating access to increasingly sophisticated and reliable methods and more data, there no longer is possible to be in denial about the results science have provided.It is also worth stressing this simple fact: This is a vast scientific field of its own, involving so much detailed knowledge that a short 'debunking statement' like the one I am responding to now, is absolutely worthless. The question is so complex that it takes a lot of study to even begin to appreciate all the facts and evidence, and to properly evaluate the validity or lack of same of the results provided by science.As a non-professional in geology, radiometric dating, dendrochronology, palaentology, glaciology and probably many other related fields of science too, I can only conclude that it is impossible for 99.99% of lay people to decide who is right or wrong regarding the question of the age of the Earth.I think it would be more fair if AiG would just say ""We do not know, except we believe the Bible says the Earth is 6000 years old, and here we stand."" You probably are familiar with paleontologist Kurt Wise's statement about this question, and it is my humble opinion that creationism would appear more honest and reasonable if it would adopt the same attitude: ""We acknowledge the scientific data, but we stand by the Bible.""After all, isn't religion about spiritual matters, man's soul, and not about the material world?

1,"First and foremost . . . Dr. Hurd, I'm glad to see you still being such a gadfly [sic].But, not without purpose.  I write this because purpose seems to be the argumentative qualifier--quantuvis.  There is no proof that can be substantiated by any human senses to show, undeniably, that a sentient being or force created the earth, life or the universe.  Not to say that experiential moments are disqualified from contemplation.  Contemplation, but not hard data.  The imagination is a petulant child that can force a person to forget rationality by means of frustration, adversity or just plain ""it is what it is.""  There could be, at some point, a convergence of   science   and faith.  Faith, or belief . . . odd conundrum.  Six days to create a universe where if one were studying the redshift of the light from distant stars shows a sea of space that is expanding at a rate that could only be proven by billions of years of expansion?  I don't think so.  And, SPACE isn't empty (just because you can't SEE it).  That takes a lot of explanation that religious texts can't, and don't, provide.  Also, the amount of times all religious texts have been rewritten should speak to the obfuscation of their messages--pars pro toto.Six DAYS?  No.  Six billion YEARS would be closer, but only about half.  Then how to explain the closest star, in light years.  No mention of that in any religious text.  Also, I find it difficult to believe, as the LDS do (not to pick a fight with a single faith), that heaven is a planet next to the sun.

1,"AFAIK, the languages of Genesis are Hebrew and Aramaic. Both of these have continuous spoken traditions. I'm not sure that you are making your point very well.AiG's point that 'yom' means a common sense day in Genesis 1 is valid.

You can believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible without believing in the 6 day creation."
1,If the   bible   is to be taken literally then wouldn't a literal interpretation include a literal interpretation of Genesis?

2,"  When materialist impose the supernatural, all they are doing is saying; ""somethings are beyond being explained through nature and by science"". They are saying somethings can't be explained through interpretation of nature.They know nothing of the same. Therefore things they define as ""supernatural"", must remain, ignored. The same adherence to ignorance, I mention in my first post.  Although ID has some appeal to ""historical science"", Darwinian evolution does even more so. We don't see ID scientist falsely promoting ID as a dogmatic ""fact of science""; as we see the mainstream doing with, Darwinism.

1,Dr. Hurd does not seem like a YEC... he is on the Earth not created in six days side.My question is:  How can you both believe in a literal Bible and at the same time NOT believe in a six day creation?  Isn't the whole Genesis as six actual days idea A literal interpretation?
1,"A six day creation is a literal interpretation of Genesis, but it is not the only literal interpretation. You always pick the narrowest interpretation as if it was the only interpretation. It is not."

2,"I do believe the world was created in 6 days. I believe EVERY Christian must believe this because without Genesis being a ""fact,"" the bible would be useless. Let me explain why. If God hadn't created Adam and Eve and given them dominion over everything on the earth, under his authority, the bible would not make any sense. Adam and Eve were created within those days, and were also given the chance to either choose to obey God or to choose to disobey and learn of the knowledge of good and evil. This is where SIN became part of this world: through Adam eating from the tree. If Genesis is just a ""myth"" and the rest of scripture is to be taken as ""fact,"" the bible just does not make any sense. We would have no idea what sin is, where it came from, why we need our relationship with God restored, why we are above animals, and how this world came to be. "
1,"Are we really arrogant enough to think that a day to us equals a day to God? The thing is, the Bible never says how long a ""day"" is. I'm a fairly strong Christian (Episcopalian), but at the same time, I realize we need to read the Bible with a heck of a lot of common sense, and realize that a lot of the terms in the Bible are very metaphorical. Does that mean my interpretations are exactly correct? I'm not saying they are. I have to read it in such a way that I can make it all make sense to me. Do I pretend to know the age of the earth? No, nobody knows the age of the earth and we never will. It also doesn't help that you have sleazy con-men like Kent Hovind (who has a fake doctoral degree, and is a tax evader and federal criminal) endorsing such an idea. That makes the whole thing seem even more ridiculous. If I'm going to believe something, it better not be the ideas of a criminal. "
2,"In Genesis, we have no reason to believe that ""one day"" meant any more than ""one day"" today. Remember God rested on the 7th day, not for himself (because he didn't need it), but for us to rest. If that ""day"" was longer than a ""day"" in this present time, why would he have rested for us, so that we would have a day of rest.I have no prediction on the age of the earth, a mystery that will always be unsolved. I do believe that God had the power, if he is the creator, to create thw world we live in called ""earth"" in 6 days. He is all-powerful, so why could he not just bring into existence - the Earth?Don't use a straw-man argument to say we shouldn't believe God was being literal. Many atheists, professors, and people of high authority have been criminals. Does that mean we should not listen to anything they have said based on choices they made prior. Not always, no. So not a good point there."
1,"""In Genesis, we have no reason to believe that 'one day' meant any more than 'one day' today.""The Bible wasn't written in English, it was written in ancient Hebrew.  In ancient Hebrew, the word ""yom"" could mean a 12 hour day, a 24 hour day, or simply a long period of time.  Who's to say that's not a couple of billion years?  When it was translated into English in the Middle Ages, there was no reason to believe that it was anything other than a day.  Now, however, as all fields of science point to a signifigantly longer period of time, it is time to reassess the translation, though the text is still valid. (please refer to my other comment on this topic titled ""Think about this"")  Also, the Kent Hovind thing was an ad hominem, not a straw man.  It was a really good try, though."
1,"If scientific inquiry has shown conclusively that Genesis is at best allegorical, then Christians should reconsider beliefs that presume a historical interpretation of Eden.Doctrines like original sin, substitutionary atonement, and the trinity are not described anywhere in the Bible. They're merely theories that theologians have created to make sense of the narrative. Much like a scientific theory, theology should be questioned if it contradicts new discoveries. It's time to rethink your particular theology if you find it in conflict with the conclusions of scientists, whose theories are much easier to conclusively test and verify.Despite what you say, the Bible makes sense even to me, an atheist. The Bible as ancient folklore can teach us a great deal about ancient Hebrew society: their fears, their dreams, their iconic heroes, and their perception of the world. A document does not need to be a perfectly preserved dictation from the mouth of god to be useful."
2,"Doctrines such as: original sin, substitutionary atonement, and the trinity are very well described in the Bible. It's actually not too hard to piece together if you read scripture as a ""whole"" since it is supposed to be about God and his will for this earth. Evolution is merely a theory at best, and has more holes than swiss cheese ;). It is made to seem like it is ""irrefutable,"" but that is not the case. It is actually ""forced"" to be taught in schools as fact, although it is only the closest science can come to explaining the origin of human existence and how things developed over time. What's more controversial is the other ""separate"" theory, which I have no idea why its separate, the ""Origin of Life."" That theory is so flawed that it has to be kept a separate theory, to make evolution seem ""credible."" If you would like to discuss the trinity or etc, feel free to let me know. It's best to look at both sides like I have, not just one ""presupposed"" attitude towards the other. So would you say that the those in the bible ""lied"" about Jesus doing miracles, and God showing himself through signs or etc. Because that doesn't exactly represent how they acted: Jesus followers were promoting honesty, truth, forgiveness, etc... and they died because of what they saw and believed in. It would seem crazy that they would just make things up, and die for thier beliefs... doesn't it. Just doesn't work logically with your theory."
1,"First of all, I have no ""presupposed attitude."" I was a young earth creationist like yourself when I was first introduced to these issues. If anything, that was my presupposed attitude, and it took years for me to overcome it. If you think original sin, substitutionary atonement, and the trinity are obvious when reading the scripture ""as a whole,"" then I highly suggest that you read the works of Christians who would disagree with you. I particularly enjoyed Tom Harpur.I don't know how better to state this: The theory of evolution is the most extensively verified theory of science outside the mathematical precision of physics. No other theory has the same extent of converging, collaborative evidence from such a diversity of scientific disciplines over the past century. Paleontology, anatomy, biochemistry, genetics, medicine, psychology, sociology, geology, astronomy, and even computer science are just a few examples of the fields independently producing volumes of observations that validate the theory of evolution.As an example, consider human retroviruses. An endogenous retrovirus is a virus that infects gametes and becomes part of the genetic makeup of a species. These fragments of DNA make up about eight percent of the human genetic code, and thousands of them are in the exact same locations in chimpanzees. If chimpanzees and humans were created separately then the probability that the same viruses would infect the same locations in our genetic codes is near impossible. The only two viable explanations are that (1) we share a common ancestral population with chimpanzees or (2) the creator pre-infected both species with the same viruses in the same genetic locations. Is the second explanation compatible with your god or your notion of original sin?   http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/03/071203fa_fact_specter   That is just one example of thousands from genetics alone that validate the theory of evolution. Evolution is not irrefutable, but it has an incalculably high probability of being correct based on our observations. There is no controversy among professionals: evolution happened. The only disagreement that still exist are over the details.Ambiogenesis is a separate theory because Darwin's theory never dealt with the first life. His theory presupposed the existence of life to explain the development of biodiversity. God may have created the first life, and the theory of evolution would still be correct. Ambiogenesis is an area of ongoing research complicated by the fact that the earliest life did not fossilize, but it appears increasingly likely that the earliest self-replicating molecules formed naturally. Most of the molecules required by the simplest cells are naturally occurring.You suggested a conspiracy theory to force the theory of evolution into schools. There are thousands of scientists all over the globe from every creed, ethnicity, and nation relying upon the theory in their daily work. To suggest that all these individuals are complicit in a global conspiracy to force the theory onto school children is ludicrous. If evolution were indeed a lie, the whistle blower who could explain exactly how the theory is flawed would become a household name overnight. She would have more grant money than she could spend. In such a competitive profession, why hasn't this happened?"

1,"--Jumpstart--When materialist impose the supernatural, all they are doing is saying; ""somethings are beyond being explained through nature and by science"". They are saying somethings can't be explained through interpretation of nature.---Why would materialists impose the supernatural? This just does not make sense. ---Jumpstart---They know nothing of the same.Therefore things they define as ""supernatural"", must remain, ignored. The same adherence to ignorance, I mention in my first post.----On the contrary, materialists do not ignore the ""supernatural"", they rather find scientific explanations for said ""supernatural"" which historically has included a lot of gaps in our knowledge.--Jumpstart---Although ID has some appeal to ""historical science"", Darwinian evolution does even more so. We don't see ID scientist falsely promoting ID as a dogmatic ""fact of science""; as we see the mainstream doing with, Darwinism.---Of course ID could only wish for it to be a ""fact of science"". Those darn Newtonians and their dogmatic position.--Jumpstart---The only silence on the subject of ID, is caused by the cotton stuffed into the ears of the materialist.---Weird, so the reason ID proponents refuse to share their research is because they are materialists?It should be clear by now that science does not fill gaps with promissory notes but rather with hard work or a simple admission of ""we don't know"" and that ID proponents wish to assign 'design' to said ignorance as a placeholder while providing no guidance as to how ID will serve to strengthen the 'design inference'.Simple really...And jumpstart seems to believe that only ""materialists"" object to ID, but what about the countless Christians, like me, who have come to reject ID as scientifically vacuous even though we also hold to the concept that our universe was Created? Could it be that this has nothing to do with materialism but all with scientific content or lack thereof?"
1,"I wish my education in biology was better, I'm reluctant to engage creationists on   evolution   because I just don't have the knowledge. But I can tell a good thumping when I see one!You go!"
2,"  science   always wants to separate that messy first cell from   evolution   theory..and it's Abiogenesis... not Ambiogenesis.. - but anyway, yes evolution is separate from the explanation of the creation of the first cell.. but why does it matter?  Science needs to explain all of the above.  It needs to explain a universe which created itself, the first form of life that created itself and also a theory of evolution which operates with no actual mechanism except random mutation and survival.  None of these will work without an intelligence to guide them.Why hasn't evolution been proven wrong you ask?  First off, it's not falsifiable!!!  It's not even a proper scientific theory...because it has no actual means of being proven wrong.  What's even more ridiculous is now science takes anything done in the various subjects like genetics as 'proof of evolution'.... The fact that someone found a chunk of DNA that was an old virus and pieced it back together is NOT PROOF of evolution... it's something we have learned simply by studying the genome.  Of course genetics is related to other subjects like evolution... but it's not evolution.Evolution claims that all the species descended from a common ancestor - and that they did so by mutation and natural selection.  The problem is... if you feel that an animal changed in small steps without any guidance.. not all steps would be beneficial.  The next problem is - the fossil record would NOT look the way that it does if this were the case. Question:  If an animal which has never had 'legs' evolved a new leg... how would it happen? Would it be in small steps or would it just sprout a leg?If you are like most scientists I'd assume your answer is that it wouldn't happen instantly - that the leg would have to form in gradual steps.  So where are the fossils for the many gradual steps of this leg forming.. or for that matter every single change that every single species has gone through?  Wouldn't you have to see at least one fossil with a partially formed leg?... no?... why not?  We agreed that each step would be gradual... so why instead do we see nothing but fully functional   animals   in the fossil record?  Why is it we see nothing of that sort living either?  If you began the forming of a wing.. wouldn't there be tons of conspicuous transitions?You have seen 'The Transformers' right?  In between two stages there would be many odd forms that simply have no logical function... but the fossil record doesn't show that. - So far the fossil record has shown nothing but the vast variety of God's creatures... nothing more.Where are the transitional forms leading up to the   dinosaurs  ?  How about giraffes? Cheetahs? Woodpeckers?How is it that for the first '3 billion' years nothing was on the planet but one celled organisms and algae --- and then once we came to the cambrian period '530 million years ago' suddenly at least 19 phylum appeared (most likely more).. not only phylum.. but many sub-phylum as well.. - including chordates - with not a single transition leading to them.. all appearing in a 5 million year span of time.  Is that evolution?  Nothing but an amoeba.. and then nearly every family of animal and plant appears in the equivalent of 1 minute out of the 24 hours of history?  That's not logical if your only explanation is 'random mutation'... and it definitely destroys any idea of common ancestor unless you mean an amoeba.Look at it and think about it... evolution is a lie."
1,"“  science   always wants to separate that messy first cell from   evolution   theory..”Yes, because the theories of biological evolution only apply to living things… if its not alive then it is chemistry.“Science needs to explain all of the above. It needs to explain a universe which created itself, the first form of life that created itself and also a theory of evolution which operates with no actual mechanism except random mutation and survival.”And that is what Science is working on, so far with an exceptional amount of success in comparison to the alternative of ‘God did it’.“ None of these will work without an intelligence to guide them.”Can you demonstrate this?“Why hasn't evolution been proven wrong you ask? First off, it's not falsifiable!!! It's not even a proper scientific theory...because it has no actual means of being proven wrong.”Sure it can be… just clearly demonstrate an organism that has no evolutionary links.  No genetic similarities to any known creature, or no fossil record of ancestor species would do it.And how is Intelligent Design falsifiable?  Things like bacteria flagellum that were once held up as proof of ID have been shown to naturally evolve from other systems.“ What's even more ridiculous is now science takes anything done in the various subjects like genetics as 'proof of evolution'....

The intermediate steps could be either beneficial, or neutral to survival.“The next problem is - the fossil record would NOT look the way that it does if this were the case. “Then how would it look?“Question: If an animal which has never had 'legs' evolved a new leg... how would it happen? Would it be in small steps or would it just sprout a leg?”It would be small steps based on existing biological structures.  Tentacles can become limbs which can become legs after all.“So where are the fossils for the many gradual steps of this leg forming.. or for that matter every single change that every single species has gone through?”Fossilization is an uncommon process… so not every living thing will end up as a fossil.  No Scientists has ever expected a perfectly complete fossil record.“ Wouldn't you have to see at least one fossil with a partially formed leg?... no?... why not?”How do you mean?  Haven’t you seen the fossils of early amphibians?  They were very fish like with flippers that also acted like limbs to drag themselves across the land.“We agreed that each step would be gradual... so why instead do we see nothing but fully functional   animals   in the fossil record?”Because evolutionary steps are not driven towards some future goal, they are adaptations to present   conditions  .   The animals that we se are fully functional, and are transitional to later forms.“ Why is it we see nothing of that sort living either? If you began the forming of a wing.. wouldn't there be tons of conspicuous transitions?”Flight adaptations are very rare throughout history… though there are creatures like flying squirrels that may adapt to flight if the evolutionary pressures continue in that direction.“You have seen 'The Transformers' right? In between two stages there would be many odd forms that simply have no logical function... but the fossil record doesn't show that. - So far the fossil record has shown nothing but the vast variety of God's creatures... nothing more.”Transformers?  Really?“Where are the transitional forms leading up to the   dinosaurs  ? How about giraffes? Cheetahs? Woodpeckers?”The dinosaur evolutionary chain is rather well documented. Spondylosoma is the seen as the closest ancestor to true dinosaurs (if not the earliest dinosaur) “Look at it and think about it... evolution is a lie.”And the alternative is “everything popped into being”?  Objectively which ‘popped into being’ story is the correct one?"
2,You said 'tentacles could become legs'..here's the problem - a good design for tentacles does not at the same time mean a good design for legs.... consider what I'm saying here -- look at a starfish.. or even a regular fish - the placement of fins have a different orientation than 'future legs'... good placement for fins does not make a good placement for legs... the two are entirely different designs.. one is not appropriate for the other.. only in rare occasions - thus it's ridiculous to assume one could morph to the other..  if you had to rely on previous developments.. future developments would be improperly placed - poorly situated.
2,"because you can't imagine a reason why both chimps and humans have a chunk of DNA that has the same viral code doesn't mean it's   evolution  .  It also doesn't mean God infected them both.I could easily see other reasons.. DNA is a code.. and follows rules in the manner it's formed.  If both species had encountered a disease it's not hard to believe the viral code would be in the same location.So called 'Junk' DNA is still quite a mystery... it was only recently that they began realizing it's not junk.  Matter of fact they are considering the possibility that the so called 'Junk DNA' may be the actual information for constructing the organism.. while the regular DNA is no more than the bricks and mortar to build with - It's possible junk DNA is more important.But since you shared your retrovirus story... I'll share a story with you.. How about the recent study on sea anemone's?   http://www.bio-nica.info/Biblioteca/Pennisi2007Anemone.pdf  ''One of the big surprises of the anemone genome, says Swalla, is the discovery of blocks of DNA that have the same complement of genes as in the human genome. Individual genes may have swapped places, but often they have remained linked together despite hundreds of millions of years of evolution. . .  Moreover, the anemone genes look vertebratelike. They often are full of noncoding regions called introns, which are much less common in nematodes and fruit flies than in vertebrates. And more than 80% of the anemone introns are in the same places in humans. . . Finnerty and his graduate student James Sullivan also looked in the anemone genome for 283 human genes involved in a wide range of diseases. They will report in the July issue of Genome that they found 226. Moreover, in a few cases, such as the   breast cancer   gene BRCA2, the anemone’s version is more similar to the human’s than to the fruit fly’s or to the nematode’s. . . This implies that even very ancient genomes were quite complex and contained most of the genes necessary to build today’s most sophisticated multicellular creatures. . . ''Interesting eh?  Why would the sea anemone have such complex DNA....?  As they put it.. it possibly has the genes capable of building today's most sophistacted multicellular creatures..  So then - did it always have them?  If it was a result of mutation.. why does it share so much in common with our own?The point is... there's more than meets the eye - and simply because you find a virus in chimps that is also in humans - this is not a proof of evolution from chimps... it just means (guess what) the same virus is in both.  Science is not   science   if it makes these kinds of assumptions.Many people like to say that we have 98% of the genes of the chimp..do you know we also have 78% of the genes of a BANANA!?does that lead you to believe we are related to a banana?question everything - science included."
1,"""this is not a proof of   evolution   from chimps... it just means (guess what) the same virus is in both. Science is not   science   if it makes these kinds of assumptions.""Lets start off with this... Humans did not evolve from chimps.. chimps and humans have a common ancestor.Moving onward... the fact that the same gene sequences can be found in both humans and chimps is evidence that we share a common ancestor, which when combined with other evidence gives strong credence to the theory that humans and chimps are related.  Science does not 'assume' that since chimps and humans are genetically similar that we have a common ancestor, it is seen as evidence supporting that theory.""do you know we also have 78% of the genes of a BANANA!?does that lead you to believe we are related to a banana?""Yes, there is a common ancestor between humans and the banana... an exceptionally distant one to be sure.""question everything - science included.""That's the point of Science... Science is there to be questioned, tested, and re-evaluated.  That is why scientific theories are constantly being changed or discarded based on new observations."
2,"Yes, I understand we didn't evolve from chimps from the position of   evolution   theory - and I'm sorry for saying it that way considering I truly don't want to encourage the misinformation and typical uninformed view. You never addressed any of the sea anemone info.. my point is - if we have a 'common ancestor' the more we look at the info.. the only common ancestor we could have is an amoeba - and we would have lost common ancestry at that point.  Why? Because of the cambrian explosion - which shows that at one moment (5 million years or so) nearly every phylum appeared.'Geologically speaking, 5 million years represents a mere 0.11 percent of Earth’shistory. As Chinese paleontologist Jun-Yuan Chen has explained, “compared with the 3-plus-billion-year history of life on earth, the period [of the explosion] can be likened to one minute in 24 hours of one day.''''Cambrian rocks display about half (or more) of the basic body plans or architectural designs of theanimal kingdom.''''Representatives of nineteen of the forty known animal phyla definitely make their first appearance in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion. Three phyla appear in the Precambrian. Six animal phyla first appear in the fossil record after the Cambrian period, and twelve more are notrepresented in the fossil record.'' and my sidenote:  Keep in mind that the six phyla that appear 'after' the cambrian could always be moved earlier in the record if we find earlier examples... This is the failure of fossils. - for example.. if I find a cat skeleton in the earth... It only tells me that they existed in this form at that time... it doesn't tell me that they didn't exist in that form EARLIER in the record..  Though we have found that roughly half of the phyla and many subphyla first appeared in the cambrian - that doesn't rule out that all of the phyla could with further research be proven to appear in this 5 million year period.  A mere 6 phyla are currently shown to not...this concept is also stated in the paper as:'many paleontologists think that almost all of these additional eighteen phyla may well have originated during the Cambrian explosion. As Valentine, Jablonski, and Erwin argue, “All livingphyla may have originated by the end of the [Cambrian] explosion.”There are no transitional fossils leading up to these phylum -  a slightly exaggerated time line might appear like this:3 billion + years --) singe cell lifeforms / agae 530 million years ago --) possibly every other family of animal and plant.But this is only the original family... right? These creatures were possibly just very simple forms - so what's it matter?.... not at all.  Let's take the example of Haikouella lancelota According to Chen and his colleagues, Haikouella has many of the same features of the Yunnanozoon lividum, as well as several additional anatomical features including a “heart, ventraland dorsal aorta, an anterior branchial arterial, gill filaments, a caudal projection, a neural cord with a relatively large brain, a head with possible lateral eyes, and a ventrally situated buccal cavity with short tentacles.”Many of these phyla were in the same form as they are now seen.. in other words - they appear in the record.. with no transition up - and make no further adaptations.  Many like Haikouella are extinct.This does not support evolution.. it supports some form of scientifically unexplainable creation - it implies drastic immediate change that brings about every animal and plant family.. with no sign of transition - and then relatively low amounts of change afterward.  the only thing left that disagrees with creation is the time line - which I feel is questionable due to the methods of extrapolation since it is built on assumptions."

1,"I believe that the first chapters of Genesis, including the ancient history of the Hebrew people, should be understood within the context of covenant. My friends, Tim Martin and Dr. Jeff Vaughn, have written a book, which can be purchased at their website:    http://www.beyondcreationscience.com   /The basic premise is that the same symbolism which guides our understanding of Revelation should also guide it in Genesis. The 6-day creationists insist on a so-called ""literal reading of Genesis"" to come up with their fanciful notions of ""the end times."" This literalism includes a woman who sits on 7 hills at one time, and various dragons etc. The literalists understand these symbols in MODERN terms: locusts are helicopters, etc.When understood in covenant, we see that the Hebrew people were called out of darkness into His marvelous light. We know from Genesis that the Sun and Moon and stars represented Jacob, Rachel, and the 12 sons. We know that throughout scripture, trees and beasts are used to describe humans, both clean and unclean, fruitful and unfruitful. Darkness and light were separated, as were the land and seas in that first chapter of Genesis. Even in the New Testament, we have revealed to us that the children of light were ""called out of darkness,"" i.e., the old covenant, into the covenant of light.It is a remarkable study of covenant, and I highly recommend that anyone interested in the subject buy it and read it. Even if you don't agree with it, you'll be challenged to expand your thinking. Even the idea that Noah's flood covered the whole planet is challenged - and all of it from a biblical hermeneutic, long ago confirmed by Milton Terry, the great Methodist expositor.Beyond Creation Science: From Genesis to Revelationby Tim Martin and Dr. Jeff Vaughnavailable:    http://www.beyondcreationscience.com   /"
2,"You skewed whatever argument you were wishing to present by quoting from the Cathoic Catechism.   Any sincere New Testament bible studdent knows that there is only one one reliable and true book, the bible, and any other man written book, such as the Catechism, is not God-inspired, thus false.Going a bit further, Catholicism itself is pretty much proven to be a false religion, and that statement is made based upon sound New Testament exegesis of Revelation 13 and Paul's second letter to the church at Thessalonica, in particular the second chapter where he talks about the ""man of sin"".  Sound, competent biblical scholars have identified both the ""man of sin"" and the two beasts in Revelation 13 as the Roman Catholic church and the papal dynasty.  Go back and study the history of the papal dynasty.  Then read what God has to say about a ""falling away"", forbidding to marry, abstention from eating certain meat, etc,. This refers to none other than the catholic church.  The pope (notice I did not capitalize the P) regards himself as God on earth, and equal to God, and says he has power to forgive sins.  No one but God can forgive sins. We're also told to call no one on earth ""Father"", but do the catholics abide by that?  No.With regard to the age of the earth, let the bible be its own best interpreter.  You either believe what it say in its entirety, or you don't."
1,"""Any sincere New Testament bible studdent knows that there is only one one reliable and true book, the bible...""Any honest student of theology also knows how the Bible came to be, and it's anything but handed down from god himself. In reality, humans who claimed no divine inspiration cherry picked which texts ought to be included in the compilation! What criteria did they use to filter the heresy from the canon? We don't know."
2,I really feel sorry for you.
1,"--Jumpstart--I reckon we'll have to take your word, on your Christianity. --Should that not be sufficient? Of course, with me, countless other Christians have come to reject ID, some because it is theologically unsound, most because it is scientifically vacuous.In ChristPvM"
1,"""I really feel sorry for you.""I feel sorry for our world. Everyone should be willing to question what they believe."
1,"The history of the Bible, including it's compilation by the early church, is quite well known.  Books were chosen to be added and others were chosen to be left out (Enoch, Mary, and Thomas all spring to mind).  You can then look at it's history of translation, from Aramaic and Hebrew to Greek... then to Latin... then to the various European languages.To say it is divinely inspired is a reasonable stance to take (it is how I view the Bible), but to say that it is a word for word transcription seems quite unreasonable given it's history."
1,"I didn't realize how crazy some people were.  I don't even know where to start on this one.  We'll start with your fallacious claim that there is only one reliable and true book.  You do realize that every book of the Bible, Old and New Testament, were written by people, right, not spoken word for word by the Angel Gabriel to Mohammad?  You also realize that it was the early Catholic Church that decided which books would be included in the Bible and which would not, right?  And even if the Bible were the only god-inspired book out there, that still doesn't make any human ponderings on it automatically false.  Otherwise this whole conversation would be false.  Just because a couple of preachers out there who can't validate themselves without attacking an older, more established, and larger organizations who you claim are ""soud"" and ""competent"" have two or three passages that could be interpreted as being negative about the Church if you squint your eyes and cock your head to the side a little bit doesn't ""prove"" anything, much less that Catholocism is a false religion.  The Bible itself says that the devil can quote scriptures for his own purposes.  Furthermore, the Pope doesn't and never has claimed to be a god on Earth, but rather to be a representative of Yahweh on Earth.  Furthermore, the Pope doesn't claim to be able to forgive sins, but rather cites Matthew 16:19, which reads ""Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven,"" to justify interceding as the successors of Peter and the Apostles on behalf of the one Confessing that Yahweh will forgive the sins.  And where does it say to call no one on Earth ""Father?""  Finally, who are you to tell people how they can interpret the Bible?  It didn't come with instructions!  If I think it has no religious value at all, but has a few nifty stories that I think are entertaining and have a good message, then that's my business, not yours!  If someone thinks that it shouldn't always be taken literally, and that it often uses metaphor, that's their business!  I'm sure your hand has cause you to sin before, but I bet you still have both of your hands.  There is no doubt in my mind that you have beheld another human and lusted, but I bet you did not pluck out your eye.  Surely the passage that prescribes such treatment of your body is metaphorical and hyperbolic, so why can't others be the same?PS.  Please don't go and cut off your hands and pluck out your eyes.  It would make it very difficult for you to type, and you amuse me way to much for that."
1,I wish I could express my support for your comment more fully. Well said. 
1,"Not only do I think the Young Earth Creationists are wrong in their opinions, I think their teachings should be regarded as blasphemous to God Himself. Those teachings imply that God made the Earth and universe to look billions of years old when they are not, thus making God to be a liar. And so they might as well believe in no God at all. Based on my own experience, I can state that the lies and unsupported claims of Creationism will do far more damage to the faith of Christians than evolution ever will."
1,"quite so well as Christians themselves. I would say Ted Haggard is an excellent case in point.I can't help but laugh that Palin, a young earth creationist, was so eager to ""Drill, baby, Drill"", when the search for oil is so intensely related to a deep understanding of how the earth was really formed, and how long it really takes to create big pockets of oil underground."
1,The christian faith is a mockery to humankind.All religions are a detriment to humans and the earth.We need to call out people making these insane arguments whenever we see them in order to STOP the religious from destroying earth and its inhabitants.
2,"First, even as a Bible-believing creationist, I want to say thanks for bring attention to Genesis 2. I am surprised how many Christians have not noticed this chapter. The Hebrew used it not thought to be figuaritive, but this brings attention the order and matter of time we have grown to think. I do think that in the 2nd chapter of Genesis it is referring to time as a ""period"" or ""era"", just as we would say, ""I lived in California for a time"". There are no specifics. I would also like to point out that Job is recorded as the oldest and thus first book of the Bible written, between Job and Psalms we see great awe and majesty described by the writers. Thought we have learned so much through science and technology, there is so much we do not know. It is amazing to me to think of the beauty, creativity and perfection that is made in space and here on earth--which to me point to a God with intelligence, morality and emotion--similar to ourselves. The study of science is intriguing but it shouldn't get in the way of ruling out the Creator."
1,"""The study of science is intriguing but it shouldn't get in the way of ruling out the Creator.""Ruling out any creator(s) is a philosophical question.  There can never been any scientific evidence to ""rule out"" a creator.Creation in six literal days is a scientific question and it is clearly ruled out.""there is so much we do not know.""I assume you are speaking for yourself.  At any rate this does not seem to be a good basis to ""point to a God with intelligence, morality and emotion--similar to ourselves"".  That seems be be quite a non sequitur.  Our ignorance implies a supernatural being similar to ourselves?  I don't think many people would like this ""argument""."
1,"In a literal translation, Genesis 1:31 and 2:1 state that God created the heavens and the earth in six days. Genesis 2:2 states that God finished his work on the seventh day. Genesis 2:4 begins an account of the day in which the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.Interpret this literally and the creation accounts dissolve into nonsense, with creation happening in one, six and seven days. To make any sense of it, both creationists and others are forced to take at least some of these accounts figuratively and not literally. If you want to take the Bible seriously, you can't take it completely literally, even if you are a literalist!"
2,"If you're tired of debating Pandas, fine. Explain to me what rules of science ID violates. "
2,as has already been covered... the different stories of creation are in perfect agreement - you simply are misunderstanding them.  At the risk of repeating what was already said - Genesis 2:1 is the 6th day and the creation of man...it's not the story of creation - it's a focus on that day of creation in particular...  I don't want to be rude.. but I'm quite shocked that people can't read these two passages without thinking they disagree... It shows to me there's no way God COULD write the story without people disagreeing with it...Seriously... can you imagine a version of the Bible being written that some portion of the world wouldn't say 'That's not God's word... he wouldn't say that' .. or some version that no one would claim that there are contradictions?  I sure can't... man is incredibly faulty..  It's been my opinion that when God created the heavens and earth - and the   animals  .. he had a good thing going.  Then he created man... it's been downhill since.
1,"Genesis 1:31 and 2:1 say: ""And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. [The heavens and the earth finished in six days.]Genesis 2:1 says: ""And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.""[God finished his work on the seventh day.]Genesis 2:4b-7 says: ""In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up- for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground; but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground - then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.""[the day of creation]A one day creation, a six day creation and a seven day creation. That's what you get if you interpret the Bible literally."
2,"I can see how it would be interpreted as a contradiction.. but it really isn'tFirst off the statement 'And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made'  only at first appears that he took 7 days... just read the sentence again - he rested on the seventh day... just the same as in the other verse... no conflict - it's just the wording of 'On the seventh day God finished his work'..    If you worked 6 days of the week - on the seventh you would have finished your work...  The creation was a week - with the last day resting.. same in both.as far as verse 2 it is an entirely different type of story...It's mainly dealing with the creation of Adam but also the naming of the various generations of   animals   and plants by him.  Verse 2 is not an actual step by step story the way the first verse is -- you can tell by the wording itself2:4 begins'These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens'He's telling us right off the bat.. that what we have is a telling of the generations of animals and also man that was created 'in the day that the lord made the earth and the heavens'....The 'creation of the heavens and earth' was the entire process... not day 1.....same as it says 'in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'  in verse 1..this is not simply the first day.. but an introduction to the process.  Although I had never considered the interpretation you are describing.. it seems you are saying that it contradicts because of the use of the word 'day'?  Just like in hebrew - our word day has a double meaning.. it can either mean a time.. or an actual day - like the phrase 'back in the day' =)  What separates this day from the days in verse 1 is most importantly the lack of the mention of 'evening and morning'.But back to the point - Verse 2 is a telling of how he created the animals and also man.  Let's look at the verse once more - ' These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.'As I said... this part is not a 'step by step' of creation.. it is just as it says 'the generations in the day that God made them (heaven, earth, plant and herb)'  It is a special verse devoted entirely to the telling of the process of making man - and later Adam naming the animals.  The purpose of this verse in not to simply retell the creation story a second time (there would be no point to that).With that in mind.. this is why the statement of God 'having not caused it to rain upon the earth' is not an issue... simply because this is not a retelling of a creation.. but used to express a different idea.. I'll try to state it the verse in more of a plain english.. rather than Bible english -' This is the story of the making of all the living things on the Earth (generations), and how it occurred ... to witness the process we return to the point just before their making - the point before God had made it rain upon the Earth and before there were a man to work the ground.'The supposed 'contradiction' arises when you assume that 'God not having caused it to rain' is in chronological order to Genesis 1.. or that this is a step by step piece.  It is an introduction to Genesis 2 in the same way that 'In the beginning..' is the introduction piece for Genesis 1.That is the way it reads for me... and believe me - it was difficult for me to try to put this into words for you.....understanding the verse and explaining it are two entirely different things - but this is the interpretation I've always got from this verse.. In genesis 1 we tell the story of how it all was created - in Genesis 2 we go back a step.. and tell the story of animals and man.  The verse serves to separate Adam from all the other beasts and make clear man's importance.Hey... I'm no Bible scholar.... I value the fact that you've pointed out the 'contradictions' because I've never understood what people meant by a contradiction in Genesis... I feel it's in the reading that it sounds like a contradiction... "
1,"My point was not that Genesis contradicted itself but that if you took it literally it contradicted itself. The problem is not with Genesis so much as a literal interpretation of Genesis. You have to get away from literalism to make sense of the two creation stories, with their different orders of creation. You have proved my point by showing how a less than literal interpretation of the passages gets round the problem of a literal interpretation."
1,"When there is clear and overwhelming proof that evolution is the process by which life has developed on earth, it is painfully stupid to believe that the earth was created as it is now 6000 years ago by a magical man in the sky. Citing the bible or any other religious text as proof to the contrary is akin to citing Aesop's fables as proof for talking animals."
2,Yes and no. However what about those who refuse to accept it simply because they don't want to. They don't truly deny it exists.. they just refuse to accept it. It's like ignoring a baby crying...
2,"Having the ability to learn, but refusing it, is ignorance."
1,"Knowing something to be true and accepting a contradictory story that you know is untrue is even more stupid. Other people on this debate say that creationists are simply ignorant, not stupid. However, what you are advocating is that these people know the truth and still don't believe it. If that isn't stupidity, I don't know what is."
2,Well yeh.. but I would say it's kind of like denial. Like when alcoholics say they're not alcoholics...
1,"Alcoholism is a disease. Those who have it have cant help the fact that they feel an exaggerated pleasure response when they consume alcohol. Unlike alcoholics, creationists have the option to learn the truth and cure their creationism simply by reading an 8th grade science book, or attending public school. Since they refuse to inform themselves before they decide on their beliefs, they can be considered stupid."
1,"If Intelligent Design is a valid scientific concept, why is it that we have examples of IDIOTIC design in so many organism, including vertbrates? All their eyes are wired BACKWARDS, making their retinas vulnerable to damage. And there is no good reason for this, because the eyes of cephalopods are wired FORWARDS. It seems that there was a more intelligent Designer for the cephalopod eyes than for the vertebrate eyes."
2,"No, but the point remains the same. It's denial of something that's staring you in the face."
1,"So how is that not stupid? If you can see the evidence for something, and you continue to believe something else based on no evidence, that is stupid. That's like me believing that people can fly because I read it in Peter Pan, and continually denying that people cant fly despite the evidence against it. Denial does not excuse stupidity."
1,"1. lacking ordinary quickness and keenness of mind; dull.2. characterized by or proceeding from mental dullness; foolish; senseless: a stupid question.3. tediously dull, esp. due to lack of meaning or sense; inane; pointless: a stupid party.4. annoying or irritating; troublesome: Turn off that stupid radio.5. in a state of stupor; stupefied: stupid from fatigue.6. Slang. excellent; terrific.yes I must say, to deny scientific fact which is backed by huge amounts of evidence is indeed quite STUPID. I know plenty of religious people who completely believe in evolution, and this is possible because religion and evolution are compatible. Science and religion will ultimately not be compatible, but like I said religion and evolution are completely compatible. To deny evolution because of ancient scripts which are almost entirely untrue is a bit stupid."
2,"A lot of them are stupid and come up with outright stupid, ignorant arguments against it... but a lot choose not to agree with it because it contradicts their faith."
2,"Not stupid, but ignorant and perhaps even foolish. To deny what is a widely accepted and evidenced theory is simple ignorance."
1,"I agree with your definition of ignorance, but I feel that ignorance crosses into stupidity when those who are ignorant, but have the means to inform themselves fail to do so. As is the case with almost all American creationists."
2,"Yeah that's kinda true.. however I don't think it's as widely accepted as you think it is. Maybe with the scientific community, educated community, developed countries it's more popular.. but outside of that where the vast majority lies it's much less popular.I know there's a few.. maybe not a lot.. but a few people who are smart, religious, educated etc. but choose to deny evolution because they're strongly religious and say that because it doesn't agree with them.. they don't believe in it."
1,"Scientific subjects such as the creation and development of the universe aren't really democratic topics. Just because some smart people who believe in evolution are outnumbered by an army of morons who believe in creationism, doesn't give creationism any more validity. Those who believe in creationism when there is clear, scientific evidence against it are either ignorant to the theory of evolution or stupid. But those who continue to believe in creationism despite having access to the truth (like in America) are surely stupid."
2,To me I do not see us evolving even if it takes forever it still does not show.
2,"First of all there have been writings in hebrew . they were written in stones why would they spent all their life writing about god.( because GOD IS REAL). unlike evolution is a theory, now tell you guys who beleive in evolution, were you there when these things happened?? wait! i know your answer, NO! but i will tell you this if god didnt exist where are we going when we die. so mean to tell me there is no right or wrong?wow so you mean to tell me we came out of soup and my dog came from a rock? well thats what revolution said! the reason why theres lots of animals is because it started from two dogs going up. isnt weird how the bible says all these animals before we found it i dont know anout you but im a christian and im stickin with creationism! its the only one to make sense!!!!!!! yea big bang WOW, really real huh? NOT!!"
2,I recently read that after careful study the 'backwards' wiring is essential.. - something to do with cooling? I really can't recall...but considering I don't have a citation to give you - or a link.. what's it matter.But anyway..I heard a list of reasons that our eyes for functional reasons are wired differently (front to back) I'm sure if you cared to seek them out - you'll find the defense for such 'mistakes'.. it's your dime.Also.. In man's arrogance he assumes that anything he hasn't found a use or reason for must not have a use or reason... remember junk DNA..... not junk.  Remember the 'useless' appendix... not useless.  Your view that accidental nature is a great designer is what is nonsense.... Funny how man is scrambling to find any 1 thing they can point to as a 'bad design'... that in itself shows that the design is if anything near perfect.   But what's it matter -   evolution  .. a theory without mechanism.. can design anything!   
1,"There's no point arguing against evolution when you don't understand it in the first place. Learn the theory, the science, the facts and THEN debate it. You don't seem to have even the remotest idea of evolution"
2,Now creationism to me makes much more sense... Evolution is a theory that has not been proven and i think probably never will be...I have never seen an ape evolve into a human and although i have never seen god that makes more sense then evolution.
1,"Ok, so, you're saying, since you've never ""seen"" an ape (which is the wrong animal, again) evolve into a human, and never seen God create a human, God wins this debate? So, just because we haven't proven we're from chimpanzees, gives grounds to say God made us? There's a huger spectrum out there. And again, I'll say, the theory of evolution isn't that humans are from chimpanzees; it's just an idea because our DNA's are closely related. Because, you're right, there is no proof of THAT. But there's proof of evolution itself. And it has nothing to do with creationism. This is the ignorance in today's society and it is merely all about ""science vs. religion"" which is again, two totally different things that shouldn't be combined as much as they have been."
1,"She said she's never seen an ape evolve into a human. As an argument. She's either excellent at deadpan humor, or a troll. My money's on troll."
1,"I find it immensely amusing when Christians require proof before they'll believe in something. It's even funnier when the scientific, verified, reproducible proof exists, and they still won't believe it because ""it hurts their head"" to think about it."
2,"I agree totally with what you said Cerin...I, too, find it a bit amusing and tiresome."
1,"The theory behind evolution is not that an organism evolves during its lifetime, but that the species evolves over thousands, if not millions, of years or generations. Evolution takes time, survival of the fittest, and genetic variation, among other things."
2,"Hey razza for i wanna say thanks for standing up for what u believe in, Most people want hard evidence that will prove Gods existence, when really we ourselves are evidence that God exists. Anyways i believe in change over time like how things are improved over time, like for say how cars have been improved to work on other things other than fuel. But i disagree with the whole monkey theory, God clearly said in the book of genesis that we were created in his image, We do not have a monkey god, its so sad to see how many people have fallen for this. God is God and he makes everything the way they are supposed to be. What good is faith with the presence of evidence, why do we rely on hard evidence, God says believe and you shall see my kingdom, of course people would come to jesus with evidence in their hands, but thats our main test here on earth, God is looking for those who will believe in him without seeing him, clinging to the promise of going to heaven one day and to conclude i just have to say that we are creation and nothing can change that."
1,"I have never seen an ape evolve into a human and although I have never seen god, that makes more sense than evolution.What kind of an argument is that?!The evidence for evolution has primarily come from four sources:1. the fossil record of change in earlier species 2. the chemical and anatomical similarities of related life forms 3. the geographic distribution of related species 4. the recorded genetic changes in living organisms over many generations.http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_3.htm Had you taken the time to do a little RESEARCH you would have stumbled upon evidence that suggests evolution is more likely than a being that decided to create our Universe. By the Way, you have been misinformed: it's not apes, it's chimpanzees."
1,"Correction, it's an ancestor of both chimpanzees and humans."
1,"If you are going to comment on something in   science  , you need to back it up with actual data. Mere assertions count for NOTHING. And your statement that   evolution   is ""a theory without mechanism"" is simply wrong. The mechanism of evolution is natural selection, which is what Darwin identified. The appendix has a lot of lymphatic tissue which is what you would expect in an organ that no longer has a digestive function but is prone to infection. It's when that tissues fails to function that we get appendicitus. That also shows natural selection in action, as well as its limitations. Indeed, there is plenty of lymphatic tissue and ducts throughout the abdominal region.My point about the vertebrate eyes being wired backwards and therefore being an example of bad design still stands."
1,"Oh boy, here we go again. Weren't the first 1000 Creationism/Evolution debates enough?Now creationism to me makes much more sense... Evolution is a theory that has not been proven and i think probably never will be...I have never seen an ape evolve into a human and although i have never seen god that makes more sense then evolution.Creationism is also a theory and will definitely never be proven because it's untestable, i.e. it relies proving the existence of God first. Scientists have seen organisms evolve into different organisms both directly (e.g. bacteria) and indirectly (e.g. fossils)."
1,"I could argue the many reasons i dont believe in creationism, but i would never be able to end my list. Also, i could give many reasons for UNDERSTANDING the theory of evolution, and i dont think that i would want to type that much, but what i will say is that evidence is evidence and sorry for the creationist side but you guys have none at all. You know what evidence we have, open a biology textbook, research a little about the fossil records, and also stop ignoring the stuff you dont believe in the ""good book""(if you can call it that without being totally ass backwords). You cant just go and edit the book of ""god"" so that you feel better about what your believeing. That means that you cannot be a person who supports democracy because your religion calls for direct obediance to government as if to god. What is that shit. Any half brain would realize right there that what there reading makes no sense and close the book and go get one from barnes and nobles that makes sense, and has evidence to support it to boot. Drop the fairy tales already and grow up. There are more problems caused by religion than atheism, you just have to take off the blinds, take out the earplugs and open your mind. Thank you."
2,"Science involves observations, theory, design, testing and predictable outcomes. How does one design test and observe evolution? If the latter is as ubiquitous as Darwin suggested, we should have many transitional species that can be observed in the immediate past not just ""long ago and far away"". Where for example, are the remains of ""mutated"" apes that have failed to propagate? All we have is some dubious fossils, the false claim about peppered moths and where bones found far apart, are assumed to be from the one individual (e.g pitdown man). For macro evolutionists there is only ‘one game in town’ to explain the new information which their theory requires—mutations. Even then we have two competing theories one of gradual changes over time and SJ Gould's punctuated equilibrium, the sudden appearance of unexplained species. These are accidental mistakes as the genetic (DNA) information (the coded set of instructions which is the ‘recipe’ or ‘blueprint’ specifying the construction and operation of any creature) is copied from one generation to the next. An analogy: new computer programs do not arise from old computer programs by copying errors. Instead, the resulting program usually jams. However, some evolutionists believe that occasionally, a ‘good’ mutation will occur which will be favoured by selection and will allow that creature to progress along its evolutionary pathway to something completely different.Evolution therefore is certainly not a given and certainly not ""childishly simple"" as Dawkins would have us believe."
2,"Therefore, evolution has not been scientifically proven. It has been heavily supported by evidence, but this evidence is not substantial enough to ""prove"" this theory. The question is specifically ""Has evolution been scientifically prove[n]?"" and the response, even here, is ""No."" There is no mathematical formula, there is no absolute evidence in its favor. There is reasonable doubt, no matter how little."
1,"I agreed with you up until ""reasonable doubt."" The social sciences, which incorporate the confounding input of statistical variability, have something called Statistical Significance. This means when something acts in a predicted way a certain percentage of times, given the sample is large enough, it can be considered reliable enough to base other research on. In other words, when something is accepted by the scientific community at large (which evolution IS, don't let the media deceive you), there is no reasonable doubt about it.Speaking of science reliable enough to base work on, consider the company Monsanto, and others like it. They specialize in breeding (EVOLVING) plants and patenting their genotypes. Pure fucking evil, but obviously based on sound science. Major international corporations base their entire business model on evolution. They have no reason to do this if they are not completely convinced of the reliability of that basis."
1,"Therefore your usurpation of supposed assumption of stated opinion cannot be proven or supported by evidence, but is not substantial enough to answer the question specifically.No.no no no no no no noNo.I disagree.Thank you for arguing."
1,"What evidence is there that universal evolution doesn't exist? The universe constantly changes. Creationism is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the creation of the ever expanding universe. One must realize that the books of Genesis were not testimonies by God, and therefore were not revelations to us. A revelation is only a revelation to the individual who received the information directly from God himself. As soon as the person tells someone else that something was revealed to him by God, it can only be hearsay and nothing else."
2,"This is not a debate on whether you can disprove it or not, this is a debate on if in your mind it's been proved."
2,"This isn't the debate about which makes more sense over a seven day creation or evolution, it is one of belief in evolution. Most people on here, dont deny it due to their religion, they do it based on factual information or lack thereof. Just because you believe in this doesnt make it easy to understand. We can all take the concept of, oh, we evolved from organisms and animals, but you have to be able to prove how that happens, which no one can."
2,"That is your opinion.The truth of the examples given, and those not given, these being: bacteria, viruses, prions, whether disease causing as in flesh eating bacteria or whether innocuous does not change the fact that what is being observed can only be described after the fact. That live virus forms are engineered and released onto the unsuspecting human population is no consolation to those viruses that never got a chance to get started. Live viruses only protect against one clad, are unstable, and vaccines generally contain co-contaminants that are a result of the production process. Another Case in point: pig farms. Overuse of antibiotics breeds new forms of superbug. What is really happening is that the bugs are already there. Those more successful, or less inhibited, become more prevalent in their environment. Does this mean that man causes all disease to begin with? Hardly.In the end Darwin said it best in On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life:Let it be borne in mind in what an endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic productions, and, in a lesser degree, those under nature, vary; and how strong the hereditary tendency is. Under domestication, it may be truly said that the, whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic. Let it be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life. Can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life, should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection."
2,"First, I believe that religion is man-made, as are Christ, Buddha, Mohammed, et al. Thus, they truly are the opiate of the masses, and inherently flawed. Religion can be used for good and evil. Nonetheless, that's all it can be used for: a tool. Most of the time, that tool is used for evil, the perpetualization of ignorance and results in misery. Intelligent design has merit, but it has no place in government, schools or courthouses. It is and should remain personal.However, I think that SOMETHING set all this into motion. I truly believe their is a God, though in what sense, I can't say. I think ""God"" is best defined as a Great Architect, for my purposes. As an agnostic, I think knowing God is inherently impossible, at least until my life ends, or rather, when and if my spirit dies.I used to be a practicing christian, but as I evolved and saw how that religion and its worshippers lead through fear and are hypocrites like the rest of us, I moved on. Fear and growth are incompatible, as are ignorance and tolerance.When I began studying physics and astronomy, though, that knowledge left me believing that there IS a reason for all of this. I guess I could sum it up by saying whatever Architect there is, he, she or it set evolution into motion. Ask yourself this: ""if the universe is expanding, what happens when that expansion ceases?"" My answer is that it can't be random. If there is an end to our universe, what lies on the other side? For now, that is unknowable. But it won't stop me wondering."
1,"Whether or not something is scientifically proven or a theory are simply human conventions that we try to apply to the unexplanable. There are too many natural occurences that we as humans will try to explain and simply fail to explain, which is how I believe creationsim was brought about in the first place. People tried to explain the incomprehensible."
1,Read the whole comment that he makes first
2,"Well personally, my second cousin by marriage on my mothers side descends from the Archea branch, but my bosses boss is an arachnid. To my knowledge they are not related."
2,"Fact shmakt.That is just your opinion.Not everyone evolves. Look at Neanderthals. What happened to them? Did they die out on their own? Or was it MURDER?!!!And if its true that humans killed off the Neanderthals, can we really say it was natural selection; or is it necessarily artificial selection, having been done at the hands of humankind?*""This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection."" - Charles Darwin,On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."
1,"Yes, everyone evolves, as everyone endures mutations. What you are saying implies that there is a set path planned for the evolution of certain species, which there is not. Mutations are accidents. They can sometimes benefit.Also Neanderthals died out on their own because it was an injurious variation. and what bothers me is that you said ""that is just your opinion,"" because that usually infers that you are saying that person is wrong and you are factual. You are not factual. Saying ""that is just your opinion"" does not make it wrong!"
1,"It doesn't need to be proven as there is no underlying math, (in physics there is).It is widely acknowledged as ""what happened"" and that is proof enough, it should be taught in schools therefore."
1,"I've studied a lot of Biology and to me evolution has indeed been proved.The way science uses the word ""theory"" is not the same as the way its used by the general public. The general public uses the word ""theory"" to describe an assumption, something that may or may not be true, something not proved. Science however, uses it in quite a different context. ""Theory"" for science is the explanation of how something works. Not an assumption of how it may work, but a thorough and well examined explanation of how it works. Nothing is given the status of a ""theory"" in science unless it has been tested over and over and over again and proved by other sciences and observation. Take gravity for example. There is the Law of Gravity, which says that things tend to fall downward. Then there is the Theory of Gravity, which explains what Gravity is, what causes it, and how it works. Its not an ""assumption"" of how it works. Its a proved explanation of it. I have come across many religious people that see evolution as a threat to what they believe. They say it contradicts the theory that God created man. But at no point has the theory of evolution ever claimed to know WHO created the building blocks or the why. In my opinion, there is a way to accept both. If you believe that God created man then evolution is the way by which he went about doing it. What's wrong with that?"
1,Maths is the only branch of science that offers 100% proof of its arguments. Evolution while backed up by a massive amount of evidence could never be proved beyond all doubt as there is always the chance that evidence has been misinterpreted. People used to believe that the world was flat and look what happened to that idea! Ok so science has come a long way since then but we still have huge bias in the fossil record and gaps in our knowledge that will probably never be filled. We will never be completely sure.
2,"For (Macro-)Evolution Theory to be valid, laws of nature that are generally accepted as true and standard must be repeatedly denied. The typical outcome of a dramatic mutation is that it: (1) does not reproduce in the mutated form to a successful degree, (2) is often sterile, and (3) has low survivability rates. (Macro-)Evolution Theory supposes that these natural limitations to mutation were repeatedly set aside over innumerable generations in an ever-succeeding pattern that defies the standards known to exist - and, further, that this denial continued successfully over millions of years."
1,"1st: Evolution does not require dramatic mutation. Most evolution occurs through small incremental mutations over many many generations. (If it helps, imagine how people age. From day to day there are no obvious differences, but over long periods of time, people can look completely different then they did when they were younger.)2nd: We have seen significant mutations occur that do not affect the viability of the organisms offspring.3rd: We have actually seen evolution occur, even to the point of speciation.4th: You're dumb to think that you know more than every biologist on earth.In short, you're wrong because you are distinguishing between micro and macro evolution. Macro evolution is the same thing as micro evolution, just on a larger time scale."
1,"--Ask yourself this: ""if the universe is expanding, what happens when that expansion ceases?"" My answer is that it can't be random.--It collapses. Why can this not be random? Simple, because it depends on the amount of mass in the universe, whether it is open or closed, and whether the expansion is slowing down, or increasing. However, your 'it can't be random'  does not require a designer necessarily since regularities such as laws of nature can explain these behaviors as well.We humans love to believe we are here for a reason, and I can understand, as a Christian myself, why we may hold positions of faith. However, when I see claims that one can prove the existence of this supernatural entity or entities using science, and then come to realize that the 'science' is nothing more than 'real science cannot explain X' thus 'x should be called designed'.And that my friends is exactly the foundation of ID."
1,"yes,it has been proved we live in a SCIENCE-FI world and if we don't believe in SCIENCE it is foolishness"
1,Evolution is basically common sense once you put down your bible and get out of the church. All evolution is is adaptation over a long period of time. For instance: All human life began in Africa. The tribes spread all over the world and adapted to their climate. That is why we have so many different groups of people.
1,Evolution really is true but as we all know the main reason of how we evolve is because of God our lord. We really doesn't know if what is the specific date God created then World. is it day of the earth? or day of the heaven
1,"That is where you are wrong.The old argument that layers of sediment were deposited by the biblical flood are unsubstantial.Just because i found fish bones in my trash can does that mean they were deposited there by the flood too?The creationists need to re-examine the scriptures for where it talks about Darwin's book: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.""This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection.""-DarwinIf anything the battles between races in the bible would support Darwin's theory.And gravity is due to cosmic evolution, which operates at a cosmological time scale, not a geological one; So space-time while continuing to expand, has not been known to contract from our four dimensional perspective. Although antimater has been annihilated with Lithium in collider experiments under laboratory conditions to release pure energy. But this is generally known."
2,"The processes of evolution have been observed. This does not necessarily encompass the theory of a common ancestor, but rather the processes involved to make such a reality.We've documented this. Evolution, strictly speaking, is fact."
1,"No, that's incorrect.We've proven that genetic mutations happen, it's logical that the species that are best suited to their environment will survive, ergo we can assume that Evolution through Natural Selection happens.Not only that, but we've witnessed species such as Mayflies undergo evolutionary changes (small changes, yes, but changes none the less)Saying that it can't be proven in such a small time period is like saying that we can't prove that Pluto will orbit the sun all the way. We haven't known about it long enough to watch it go all the way around, but we can assume that it will simply because we know the mechanics behind it, just like we know the mechanics behind evolution."
2,"No, that is also incorrect.When a genetic mutation occurs in the brain it causes cancer...somtimes. Also sometimes not. But that said what is being argued ergo the question at hand, that is: Has evolution been scientifically proved, has not here been fully addressed. Or has it?What is observed in mayflies living within the environment (but never outside of one) can only be the only basis of the only possible conclusion which is - uncertain. But that is known; we haven't assumed enough of the mechanics behind the mechanics behind evolutionary action.while evolution may take our life,it will never take (pause) our FREDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"No. That's why it is called ""Evolutionary Theory,"" not ""The Law of Evolution."""
1,"Contra the ""Evolutionary Theory"", which is the selection of the fittest,*is the ""Antievolutionary Theory"", which is the antiselection of the unfittest. While this theory may be logically equivalent, it is still not accepted by the scientific community, but rather has been a victim of its own theory and been antiselected."
2,Charles Darwin wrote about The Theory of Biological Evolution not Antievolution just because the word Anti- is in front of something it does not make it correct mate.
2,"PvM, those are merely my opinions. I KNOW that the existence of God cannot be proven, then again, it can't be disproven. I never said the universe WAS created, that is just something I WANT to believe. I think it makes me a better person, and adds a certain amount of purpose to my life. That's all it is, opinion. "
1,"Actually, I'm not sure it's been proven. I do think that human evolution is what scientists say it is, in that we evolved from primates, but it hasn't been proven."
1,"""Prove"" it, my good fellow,Don't ""proven"" it,By the way"
2,"The process of evolution is fact. We have provably observed the processes that encompass this term, do not confuse this with theory of a common ancestor. Evolution simply explains the morphing from one genetic makeup to the next.The theory of a common ancestor, and the term theory doesn't imply uncertainty as quantum theory is yet to be disproved and the theory of gravitation obviously stands, seems right to me. There are plenty of fossil records to show this process and we've mapped enough genes to see the remnants of these transformations. Even if not 100%, it's a fairly clear pointer, wouldn't you think?"
1,"As I prepare to answer this question, I realize I have essentially no knowledge about the theory of evolution, besides Darwinism and the title. But the title itself is enough for me to know that it hasn't been scientifically proven: it is the THEORY of evolution. Much like the Big Bang THEORY. While it is probable that these events happened, it is not certain. And while I believe that they have happened, it is not certain."
1,"Yes, you are right, it is impossible to call it a certainity, but for this reason:All evidence for evolution is proven. The EVIDENCE is fact. The problem is it is impossible to say ""This evidence means X, X exactly, and X only."" It bothers me when people say ""it is only a theory"" to disprove it, for they are confusing the word ""theory"" with ""idea.""Here's a tip: don't use the Big Bang Theory as an example as another theory, for it is widely disputed. Use the Theory of Plate Tectonics. Anyone to not believe in that is a lunatic."
2,"To say that evolution has been scientifically proved would require that it be first studied then determined scientifically. To do so would require that the question be analyzed for its scientific qualities; those true and those false. Any falsehood would constitute a rejection of the theory as a whole, and the proponents would have to start again from a different hypothesis. This does not in any way speak to any objective measure of the absolute truth or falsehood of the theory itself, but rather the wording and logic behind the theory, as any theory can only be judged on the basis of its wording to be judged objectively, and not subjectively which would only be a matter of opinion. Therefore the rejection of the scientific method is complete in the sense that it cannot be disproven on the basis of absolute knowledge outside the tools of argument available; namely words, which are the basis for any theory or hypothesis being argued, defended, or subjected to tests to find weaknesses in order to reject that theory. Such a theory cannot be truly known or even truly unknown, for to be truly unknown one must first truly know what is not to be known, and surely that itself cannot be known, truly. Really in reality it is difficult to prove with absolute certainty or absolute uncertainty the absolute absurdity or surdity of what is known or what is to be unknown, even at a future date in time. Space. Space, the final frontier, you are already here, but knowing exactly where you are with respect to where you were is certainly uncertain for even a population of sodium atoms at or near absolute zero can not be known in terms of absolute position or velocity, for as the velocity approaches absolute zero, we become more and more certain of that velocity, but must necessarily also become more and more uncertain of its position, each atoms wave function spreading out until it overlaps with its neighbors until it is totally indistinguishable from its neighbors forming a singular blob of matter. But this is only verified by experiment, which is the only and best test to be used by the scientific method, which can only truly be used to reject a hypothesis. That said, a hypothesis may be accepted, but not scientifically, but for all intents and purposes may be treated as absolute truth, baring any contrary evidence; as occums razor would point out the simplest hypothesis which explains the phenomenon is the most likely, again baring any contrary evidence. But when that evidence cannot be explored by conventional methods of observation ie: through the senses directly or indirectly relating to the physical and tangible world, then such a theory cannot be honestly and objectively analyzed or compared to the princeps of our understanding of the world and its phenomenon; it is detached from them. Surely such a word is a word apart from other words in the world of words such a word is subject to suspicion and castigation for being as it is a word not of the other words but another word of that which cannot be known by what other words are known knowingly it is known that what cannot be known cannot be be said while being said to be known for that which is known to be known was already said, or implied, the implication being that the knowledge of the tree of knowledge of good and evil as it was written by the word in words and communicated thusly; by words, cannot be known by the same token, for the token has two sides, each side opposite the other, and each side opposing the direction of the other, without either side facing the other, but rather facing away, as it is when two sides face away from one another but do not look at each other directly. So it is that the argument, whether by proof of evidence or scientific method or any other method, that the theory cannot directly oppose its opposite argument, but can only be described from an outside observer who does not stand and look outwards only from one side or argument. One that holds the token cannot stand upon it. For one cannot at the same time support one side of an argument, and also observe objectively between arguments. Neither can the word be subdivided or separated without losing the intended meaning of the whole. But without deductive reasoning we are lost. But without inductive reasoning we cannot make general statements about the world. But without particulars the general cannot be described. But without apriori knowledge of the general, we cannot be sure of its particulars. And so the scientific method, while a tool used to disprove but said to prove cannot prove but only disprove and then only if the subject is implicitly accepted, and the method of test also being accepted in its general power to come to particular conclusions of what is known to be not true. That the evolution of the scientific method has developed is proof enough that such a theory cannot be disproven. Or has it?"
2,"No, but i do call into question the nature of your uncertainty.Consider yourself Disputed."
1,"If what you say is true, then nothing at all is scientific fact. If even one person doubts, unreasonably or not, even the most fundamental laws of physics are only theories."
2,It has not been proven and i don't think it can be...think about it this way they say humans evolved from apes or whatever right? yet have you ever seen an ape evolve into a human yourself? alot of people debate that what i cannot see i do not believe but i'm almost sure no one has seen an ape evolve into a human we my have similar looks but it doesn't mean we have evolved from apes...yes i believe in god.. and i have never seen him but god makes more sense to me then evolution ever will. show me! a documentary or something when an ape has evolved into a human
1,"Us evolving from chimpanzees (yes, it is chimps that we share the most DNA with, not apes, and not monkeys), is merely an idea just because their DNA is so similar to ours. It doesn't make the theory of evolution what-so-ever. Evolution is just the process of change or growth through genetics, mutations, and natural selection. Which has been proven. When a scientist genetically modifies the DNA of a fly successfully, it has evolved. (No, really, I recall reading about a study of them inserting a different wing color into the flys DNA and evolving the fly successfully with the new wing color). It's pretty dang simple. It has nothing to do with the creation of humans. There is absolutely not enough evidence going anywhere to lead to a decent idea of where we came from. And you learn about the history of homosapiens through archaeological anthropology, which I suggest everyone should study because most of you seem to pulling crap out of your butts."
