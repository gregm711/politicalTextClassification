1,"A changing society should not cling to traditional family models. Society is changing, and the traditional idea of the nuclear family with married mother and father is no longer the only acceptable alternative. The reason that many countries are beginning to award legal rights to gay couples is because the stability of such relationships is now recognised. There is no reason, therefore, why such couples cannot provide a stable and loving upbringing for children.
"
1,"Nuclear families are failing; can hardly be held up against gay adoption. Of all families in Australia, 22% of them are single parent families. Few will fully establish a child's potential. Over 45,000 Australian marriages will end in divorce, few of these will be families. So, it is wrong to promote the nuclear family when it is failing so badly, and it is wrong to hold-out on gay adoption in favor of the nuclear family, for the same reason.

1,"The sexuality of parents has no effects on a child's future life. American Psychological Association (Resolution on Sexual Orientation, Parents, and Children) ""There is no scientific evidence that parenting effectiveness is related to parental sexual orientation: lesbian and gay parents are as likely as heterosexual parents to provide supportive and healthy environments for their children""; and ""research has shown that the adjustment, development, and psychological well-being of children is unrelated to parental sexual orientation and that the children of lesbian and gay parents are as likely as those of heterosexual parents to flourish.""

2,"Love is not sufficient for marriage, or brothers/sisters could marry. The idea that marriage should simply be based on two people who love each other is easily dismissed when you consider a brother and sister who would wish this arrangement.
"
2,"  Evolution theory makes it clear that homosexual activities are perversions of natural biological laws. The basis of evolution is the reproduction of beneficial genes and the elimination of  detrimental ones in succeeding generations -- the ""survival of the fittest."" In our species that requires heterosexual intercourse.  If accidental mutation had ever produced a ""homosexual gene,"" lack of propagation would have quickly bred it out of Homo sapiens.  Thus, homosexuals do what they do because they want to, not because they have to.  That they have a right to do it is no excuse for new laws to force others to approve of it.  Every known human community has had the sound scientific foundation of heterosexual marriage, which we are now urged to destroy for a minority's perverted pleasures.  "
1,"Actually, homosexuality could be argued to be an evolutionary benefit for a species that is overproducing. To help save us from our own over population of the planet the gays and lesbians may be the products of beneficial genes. So, your argument, from a ""scientific"" evolutionary point of view has failed to take this important point into account. Those who keep recklessly reproducing may be the perversions of natural biological laws, ever think about that?"
2,"How can two gay individuals celebrate marriage?  The purpose of entering into a marriage contract in the eyes of Christians is for a man and woman to give themselves to one another--freely, totally, faithfully and fruitfully (fruitful being that children may bare forth).  God wanted to make this free, total, faithful and fruitful love so evident, so real to us, that he clearly stamped it into our bodies as male and female--when we come together in the sexual union (intercourse), it is a reminder that we are called to a total self-giving, nuptial love for one another.  This is what marriage is.  Lawyers will never redefine this in the eyes of the faithful (no matter what changes to civil law they might make).  Next, marriage is a sacrament.  A sacrament is defined by newadvent.org as ""an outward sign of inward grace, instituted by Christ for our sanctification.""  The substance of the ""sacrament of marriage"" or the ""sanctity of marriage"" i.e. the word ""marriage"" itself, occurs only in the religious context.  Those ""religions"" out there who recognize homosexual unions and call it ""marriage,"" are in the eyes of their Christian brothers and sisters, illegitimately and falsely interpreting the sacrament of marriage.  And it is not me or other people out there who define what the sacrament of marriage is; man does not have this authority.  It was Christ who defined marriage in holy scripture and it is from His authority that we draw our definition.  There are several scripture passages to site.  In Ephesians 5:22 for example: ""Let women be subject to their husbands, as the Lord: because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church.  He is the savior of his body.  Therefore as the Church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.  Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church...""  This passage defines marriage as a call for men and women to come together in marriage, to serve Christ, to serve each other, their family, and the community.What I am saying is that the union of same sexes cannot fulfill the sacramental definition of marriage, and hence the argument misses the mark.  It is ultimately an improper understanding of sacramental marriage.  The effort for ""gay marriage"" is really an effort to seek legitimacy.  Any attempt to do so is invalid in the eyes of Christians (and I am sure other faiths...Islam, Judaism etc) who properly understand the sacrament of marriage.  So it doesn't matter if the lawyer says it's legal.  No matter how much homosexuals want their relationships recognized and validated through the sacrament of marriage, it will never happen.  Yet despite this, we love our homosexual brothers and sisters very much, we simply do not condone their sexual relationships outside of marriage (the same goes for heterosexual sexual relationships outside of marriage).  This is not a form of discrimination, it is a matter of affirming a decision to live the life we are ALL called to live by Christ--one of chastity (a virtue which excludes or moderates the indulgence in the sexual appetite) and purity (not confusing lust for love).  Only in this way will we find true fulfillment in life, as we discover the beauty and purpose of our human dignity--the call to live a life of free, total, faithful and fruitful love.  This selfless love is pure and free of lust.  We do not use an individual merely for our sexual gratification, we come to see a person for who they are!  Marriage between a man and a woman is a reminder, an icon if you will, of this total self giving love.  This is why we fight to keep people out there from deconstructing the definition of this sacred institution.  If you are interested in finding out more about this ""Theology of the Body"" check out Pope John Paul's teachings on the theology of the body, explained by Christopher West (   http://www.tobinstitute.org   /).  It is the most profound, uplifting and eye opening material I have ever studied.  It has changed my life and how I view others."
1,"We're talking about civil marriage here, not sacramental or religious marriage. If your religion doesn't want to honor a same-sex union, fine, but at the same time, whatever happened to separation of church and state?!?!?!?"
2,I like your explanation of marriage.  I believe you are right. It is so sad that people exchange the truth for a lie.   People who believe in gay marriage set a trap for themselves.  All who believe in Christ have nothing to loose.
1,"I think you are mistaken about gay marriage, Jesus never said anything about it. What we read in the bible are what they think Jesus said and even they don't agree about many things in relation to Jesus, so not a good arguing point.However, the bible is clear that it is anti homosexual, so your right among ""believers"" and the ""faithful"", most likely your mind won't be changed to accept gay marriage. This means that you, your fellow church friends and the church itself should stay out of what is really a secular question on discrimination. Since, before we ever get the proof of whether or not heaven exists, marriage has many secular implications. Peoples taxes, property rights, health and death issues, all fall into the realm of secular legislation and as such, our government is expected to treat all people equally. This puts your feelings and faith second but it is the right thing to do."
2,"To Michelle:God is the one that created people (whether they want to deny his existence or not) therefore everyone has some measure of good in them and also a conscience. So people who chose to practice homosexuality or follow other gods are only searing their conscience.  Nature itself testifies that God exist, for instance observe the change in seasons no human being is smart enough to invent that.  Not even animals practice such depravity as some humans.  Remember sin came into the world because of Mankind.I am a Christian and I refuse to agree with three quarters of the people saying it is right when God find that lifestyle detestable.  Any Christian who tells you or anybody else that practicing homosexuality is O.K with God  he/she in their own sweet way is telling you to go hell and the spirit of truth is not them.  Don't be deceived the devil is a roaring lion seeking who he may devour.  The Bible said I present before you life or death choose life.  The life you live here on earth will determine where you spend eternity it is either heaven or hell.  Jesus is your savior while you are on earth and he is your judge once your spirit leaves your body especially if you are not a Born again Believer filled with the Holy Spirit.  A day will come when every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.  There is only one God.You may not like what I have to say, that is O.K the truth alone is controversial."
1,"If you study history, it is crystal clear that people have universally labeled things they could not comprehend as god. Mankind has created thousands of gods in its image during the 100,000 years that humans have existed in our 4.7 billion year old earth and 13.7 billion year old universe.As we learn more about all aspects of the universe and the evolution of biological life in it, the gods we created keep getting smaller and smaller. At this point, we can explain pretty much everything without invoking a sky daddy.It is way more intellectual honest to say that ""this is something we don't know yet but we are looking into it"" than to say that because we don't understand something that it must be ""god did it"".Again if you study history, you can only come to the conclusion that we are all 99.999% atheists. Most people only believe in one of the thousands of gods we have invented. Some go one god further and become 100% atheists.Now then, any argument against same sex marriage that makes reference to any of the gods we have invented is not an argument at all.Laws made by the state should not rely on such fake arguments. The state should use science base its decisions on evidence.In contrast, faith is belief in something not based on any evidence. Churches of course are welcome to use their version of god any time and make their decision based of faith.It is, however, dishonest to put faith and truth in the same sentence. Only evidence and truth belong together.Separation of church and state means freedom OF and FROM religion.People using their god argument against same sex marriage, are welcome to use it within their church but join the 21st century and let the state make decisions that do not discriminate anyone.We have a supreme court for a reason: to prevent any majority from discriminating against a minority.Be happy within your faith and let other be happy within theirs or be happy without any faith."
1,"The US is one of the few countries with a constitutional separation of church and state.Within such a system, marriage should only be defined by the state and 2 people (same or different sex) should go to city hall to get married. Priest should not be able to perform legal marriages.Only after a couple is legally married, should they have the option of going to a church of their choice to celebrate their marriage within the rituals of that church with their church community.Because of separation between church and state, churches have no say in how the state defines marriage but in pure symmetry, the state can not require churches to organize religious celebrations if they do not want to.Same sex marriage was legalized in the Netherlands in 2001, Belgium in 2003, Massachusetts in 2004, Spain and Canada in 2005, South Africa in 2006, California and Connecticut in 2008 and will be in Norway in 2009 (see    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage   ).The sky has not fallen, heterosexual marriages have not disappeared and divorces have not exploded, these countries have not gone up in smoke, ... In fact, except for these happily married same sex couples, nothing has changed.So, don't be afraid of your own shadow and support same sex marriage.Society has to continue to eliminate any form of discrimination. We did abolish slavery, gave women the right to vote, allowed mixed race marriage, ... This is one more thing that makes the world a better place. "
1,Marriage between gays and not-gays should not be an issue of the State - then marriage becomes a private matter...and people can do what they want.  That is the mistake society has made....rather than ask if gays should be married - we should ask should the State regulate marriages?  If we were to end state regulation on marriage - then gays and the not so gays can marry however they way.  Heck even a gay guy and a straight girl could marry- think of all the possibilities! 
2,"The institution of marriage is centered around reproduction, disqualifying homosexuals - Marriage laws are designed in recognition of a unique biological phenomenon. They do not create marriages so much as apply appropriate legal sanctions and privileges to the inherent responsibilities and needs where a man and a woman have or will likely reproduce sexually. Marriage was a means to solidifying and stabilizing families so that reproduction and child-rearing would be more succesful. This is why adoption laws are kept separate - the biological realities are different. So also it is bad jurisprudence to lump pairs of people that are not going to conceive a child together (via a mixing of their DNA) in with those who will. For those morbid people that lay awake at night wondering how they will get into an emergency room with their lovers I suggest a chat with hospital administrators to find out what you can do to ensure access, or maybe switch hospitals. But don't muddy the legal waters by confusing lovers or best friends with those who conceive together. You do realize that best friends are denied access on the same terms as gay lovers and it can be just as disappointing. 
"
1,"Lets begin with this..love is a profoundly tender, passionate affection for another person, a feeling of warm personal attachment or deep affection. Now a question..if a woman has the right to love a man, why cant a woman love a woman or a man love a man? Love is love and it has no gender. You cant help who you love. Who is anyone in this world to say who someone else can fall in love with? People say that being gay is choice. Well, heres another question..do you wake up in the morning and say ""hey, I think I'm going to be straight today""? I don't think so. You are not born straight or gay. You are born asexual. You have no sexual orientation. As you grow and develop you become attracted to things and for some its the opposite sex and for others its the same sex. Gays are as normal as straights or anything else in this world. Besides, who are any of us to say what NORMAL is? I've been on several websites about this gay marriage thing and most of them argued that it wouldnt be right in the eyes of ""god"". Now, I dont believe in god, but if there is in fact a god than why would he have made gays if he wouldnt approve of them? It just doesnt make any sense. Other websites have tried arguing that gays are the reason for AIDS and STDS. This is not true. If you search for the answer to the quesion ""where did AIDS orginate from?"" you would find several different answers, but none would say anything about gays. People are trying their hardest to prove that homosexuality should not be allowed by throwing false information around and that will get you no where. Another thing that people are trying say is that gay parents will raise gay children. This isn't true either. This goes back to the asexual thing. If you're going to be gay you are going to be gay. It doesn't matter who raises you or what your religion is or anything that you have any control over. I know a gay couple bothwho has two daughters  of which are straight. So that is proof that that suggestion is indeed false. And as for the statements saying that gay marriages are unatural because in ""traditional"" marriages the man and woman can have children, there are plenty of straight couples out there that are popping out children left and right! It doesn't matter how many gays there are because there will always be straight couples and there will always be more children being born. And as for gays, there are plenty of ways for them to also have children. So lets put that arguement to a rest, please! Gays deserve the same rights as straights. Gays are no different than straights. They wake up every morning and they have a life. The only thing thats different about them is they love someone of the same sex rather than the opposite. There is absolutely no reason why a gay couple should not be able to get married and have the same rights as a straight couple. "
1,"Government should not determine or exercise legal supervision over marriage.I favor a domestic civil contract for all people who choose to live together.  You get married in your church and file a domestic civil contract with the government.  The contract would provide you the rights to kinship, survivorship, joint ownership, insurance privileges (and all of the other some 4000 rights that only married people can now claim). And, for what it is worth, this would cover other cases such as a son taking care of his aging stepmother.Would that not solve this insane problem?No. Some other stupid thing would come up where gays would be denied their rights.We will never have equal rights until all people share those rights. I am not gay. But I will stand with them until they share equal rights under the law.Michelle"
2,"No matter how one looks at this question, the responses all come down to a clash of moral and religious viewpoints, or lack thereof. True, separation of church and state is said to be in effect, but has religion ever been truly separate from government? I don't think it has, or is even possible honestly, because people will always bring their religious and non-religious and ethical ideas to the table on highly controversial issues such as this one. And if they did not, we would truly live in a country that is even more closed minded and one-dimensional than many may claim it to be. If people truly kept their religious beliefs out of it, then we would be living under a much more stifling government, not a more open and tolerant one."
2,"Not all those who oppose gay marriage HATE gays, as so many commenters have been instigating. Many seem to be focusing on the ""love is love"" idea, which sounds fine, but there is always the rebuttal that this particular kind of love is ""unnatural."" I have to say that I agree, gay marriage is unnatural. Many have posed the question, ""what is natural?"" Given, it is now popular and sometimes very necessary in society to make use of ""unnatural"" processes (i.e radiation and chemotherapy for cancer), as long as they have the potential for positive results. However, in the case of gay marriage, I believe that anatomy alone is sufficient proof of how a man and a woman are the only intended course, religious standpoints aside, and how anything else is not only impossible, but indeed unnatural.

2,"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22)Therefore, God also gave them up to uncleanliness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deciet, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, backs-biters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; who, knowing the righteous judgement of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:24-32)I understand that I will get a lot of flack for this, but I'm just offering some very clear-cut answers to this question. I didn't write it, but it comes from an extremely reliable Source, and I believe it."

2,"Well, I am certainly glad I'm not in Canada, but I am inclined to my view completely agreeing with the following verse (which I don't intend to offend anyone with, it is just my belief and therefore you need to tolerate it too, just as I suppose I will have to if you disagree)....the verses are 1 Corinthians 6:9-11: ""Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?  Do not be decieved; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, NOR HOMOSEXUALS, 10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such WERE some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but yiou were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.""  thus even from these verses you can see that homosexuality IS a choice if there were indeed some who practiced it and then turned from it after obeying the gospel.  It doesn't matter what I believe, it doesn't matter what you believe this verse means or says, it matters what it DOES say, and that my friends is quite obvious, homosexuality is wrong."

Bring then out to us that we may have relations with them.: 6-But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him, 7-and said, ""Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly.""Also, if you want   homosexuality   clearly spoken of in the New Testament go to Romans 1:18-32 most specifically verses 26 and 27, but the rest helps you to understand the context....Go ahead and read those and then tell me what you think, and if you have more questions I am willing to help you understand..."

2," Reproduction is a key function of marriage, not only reproducing children, but reproducing parents and families. Throughout history, regardless of religion, ALL societies from primitive to developed have established some form of marriage to reproduce new generations of people. The fabric of society is woven by marriages producing new families with new children, which are nurtured, educated, and developed by a mother and a father into productive members of that society, who then reproduce, in kind, the next generation, each gender becoming a respective mother or father. To the degree that a society or civilization can REPRODUCE good healthy families, it will prosper. This depends on reproducing, not only children, but reproducing good fathers and good mothers by developing role model fathers and role model mothers. 
 Homosexual marriages could only reproduce dysfunction.

2,"Man and man were not made to have children together and neither were women and women. Therefore I do not believe the gay marriage should be legalized because then gay parents would be able to adopt children and I do not think that a child can be raised up properly without both a mom that is a woman, and a dad that is a man. That child would suffer from bullying by other children and eventually they might question their own sexuality, and I don’t think that their parents gay sexuality should make a negative influence on their child.     "
1,"That's your opinion.Many studies have found that same-sex parentage has no bearing on a child's self-esteem or sexuality.Furthermore, as David E. Seidelson (1966, Catholic University Law Review) pointed out (in regards to miscegenation statutes): ""Suppose, however, the social hostility aroused by a racially mixed marriage is sufficiently great to threaten peace and good order.  Is there not, then, sufficient justification for state action?  By all means.  However, appropriate state action should consist of enforcement of existing laws aimed at maintaining tranquility and, if necessary, additional laws imposing sanctions upon those who would threaten or actually commit harmful or disorderly acts as a result of a racially mixed marriage.  Statutory prohibition of such marriages as a mode of preserving tranquility makes no more sense than (and, bearing in mind the “fundamental right” of marriage, even less sense than) statutory prohibition of bow ties and mustaches.""In other words, it is the children who would bully other children of same-sex parents who should be punished.

2,"Being gay alone is wrong, so to become united in marriage with someone of the same sex is wrong.  According to my religious beliefs I beleive that people who are married should have a family and reproduce.  This is only possible if a man and a woman are married, so I believe that same sex marriage should not be allowed."
1,"Your views that homosexuality is immoral does not translate to whether or not same-sex marriages are allowed.As the courts recognized in State v. Baxley:""In 1976, for example, the Protestant Episcopal Church issued the following resolution:“Resolved, that it is the sense of this General Convention that homosexual persons are children of God, who have a full and equal claim with all other persons upon the love, acceptance, and pastoral concern and care of the Church.“This General Convention expresses its conviction that homosexual persons are entitled to equal protection of the law with all other citizens, and calls upon our society to see such protection provided in actuality.“In 1982, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church reaffirmed its position that “homosexual persons are children of God and are entitled to full civil rights.”The American Friends Service Committee, Unitarian Universalist Association, United Methodist Church, American Lutheran Church, and other churches have held this same belief (Cases and Materials on Sexual Orientation and the Law.  2nd ed.  Ed. William B. Rubenstein.  1997.  West Publishing Co.  St. Paul.“Amici Curiae Brief of Religious Organizations and Leaders.”  State v. Baxley.).  They all think that homosexuality might be immoral, yet they also believe that homosexuals should be afforded the same rights.So ... what was your argument again?"
1,"Oftentimes when discussing the issue of homosexuality, a religious argument is brought up.  Basically saying that homosexuality is a sin and is condemned by the bible.  Certainly, if you hold these beliefs you are fully within your right to express them and to practice them.  I am not here to argue whether or not the bible does indeed condemn homosexuality.  However, even if the bible does condemn sexuality I don't see the connection between that and laws allowing same-sex marriage.  Since when has our country been governed by religion.  Our government MUST be seperate from religion.  Whatever you think about homosexuality is your belief and can not be forced upon others.  Laws that outlaw same-sex marriage are doing just that and in turn violating the very freedom that this country loves so dearly.P.S Also, I believe families and marriage can function without procreation.  There are many mna-woman couples who don't have children for any number of reasons.  Whether they are sterile or just can't afford children or simply are happy without children, I don't think they are doing anything wrong and wonder if you would be for outlawing these marriages with your argument that, ""people who are married should have a family and reproduce.""

1,I'm supposed to kill witches. Should   the law   respect that particular verse? Does a   law   preventing me from killing witches infringe on my right to practice   religion  ?
1,"Oftentimes, when discussing this issue, religion is brought up.  Basically, the argument is that homosexulaity is a sin and marriage should be between a man and a women.  I'm not here to debate whether it is or isn't a sin.  If your beliefs dictate that it is wrong you are fully within your right to not be gay and to express your opinion.  However, concerning laws on this subject, since when has religion ran our country?  Our government must be seperate from our religous institutions.  I'm not positive, but the way I see our country is as a pretty free place.  Is it not?  I believe laws against same-sex marriage violate that most basic freedom of choice that we so love here in America.  "
1,"The United States takes pride in being considered the ""melting pot"" where all are accepted for who they are and what they believe in, yet there is such a heated debate over whether same sex couples should be allowed to get married.  What happened to the melting pot idea, the idea that we are all equal?  Can society really call itself tolerant if it can deny such a right to citizens whose sexual preference may be different from the majority?  It is a fallacy to assume that same sex marriage will somehow delude the general population into thinking that marriage is pointless and having children without getting married.  The fact is that nothing would change between a married man and woman were same sex couples allowed to marry.  Their bond would remain exactly the same.  It is sheerly biased to believe that one's own sexual preference is ""right"".  For society to progress, everyone regardless of skin color, religious views, or sexual preferences must be accepted.  Such things do not, in any way, change the essence of a person.   "
1,"Scanning the above comments, all I see is religious dogma and circular or undeveloped arguments. Religious beliefs, scriptures, ""God's word,"" are not arguments. By using scripture as the only source of proof for the stance against same sex marriage, one falsely gives authority to the Bible and to god. I'm not here to argue about the authority of god in general; I'm not here to argue his existence of say whether or not I agree with his teachings. I'm simply saying that in this argument, god's authority cannot prevail. There is a separation of church and state and one must acknowledge this and find another way to defend this opinion against same-sex marriage.Another argument I've noticed is that ""being gay is wrong,"" or simply that gay marriage is wrong. Arguments like this tend to either stay undeveloped - ending there and not providing anything other than an opinion, not fact - or they become circular arguments - ""It is wrong because it is unnatural....""(comment continued below)"
1,"Using terms such as ""wrong"" and ""unnatural"" does not develop an argument. These terms are used in a definite way when in fact they are indefinite. Who is to say what is wrong and how do we know what is unnatural. There are studies that say homosexuality is natural. So if one says that it is wrong because it is unnatural they might be wrong. On the other hand linking homosexuality to same sex marriage may seem like an acceptable leap but as someone else proved in a comment before it is a false analogy. Episcopalian churches are known to be advocates of gay rights - including gay marriage- although they do not think homosexuality is necessarily ""right."" It is easy to use faith as a crutch to an argument against something; it is also easy to manipulate words to form an argument as well. I would like to see an argument against same-sex marriage that does not rely on these methods and uses logic and proof as the foundation, instead."
1,"There are heterosexual couples whom cannot pro-create. If homosexuals are not allowed to marry due to the fact that they cannot reproduce, then you must also deny marraige to men with who are sterile, had a vasectomy or low sperm count. Also, you also must prohibit marraige to women whom have had their tubes tied or have gone through menopause. If you agree that these people should be allowed to marry, then you negate the argument that reproduction is the key function of a marraige.

2,"While I do not agree with some of the things you are saying, I do see what your saying about having an argument with something to back it up. What I have also noticed is that people who do agree with same sex marrige do not have their own arguement a lot of the time. The just restate the one that is presented and say that their argument is wrong. But I would like to know what side you are on, and what your argument is? "
1,"I believe same-sex marriages should be legal. I believe that the arguments against it are poor and are based on personal beliefs rather than logic.1) Denying gays and lesbians the right to marry is unconstitutional. It discriminated on the basis of sex. It also denies them of the many benefits of civil marriage such as:  to call out of work to take care of a sick partner or partner's child, to receive social security continuation after a partner dies, file joint tax returns, etc. If two people are in a committed, monogamous relationship they should be able to get married and fulfill their promises to each other. 2)  Some say that they are against gay marriage because the definition of marriage is ""an institution between one man and one woman."" But WHO says what marriage is to be defined by? Their argument basically stops there because there is nothing else to add to it. It is word manipulation because definitions are never set in stone. They develop over the years as does language in general. Other words are given multiple meanings and connotations yet we seem to be stuck with just ONE for marriage. Tradition seems to be the only thing that keeps this definition from changing and in the past tradition has lost. Just look at slavery and the treatment of women.3) ""Marriage is for reproduction."" What about infertile couples? A post menopausal mother or a impotent father cannot reproduce. Are they not allowed to marry? Actually, they are. So how is this a valid argument?4) Same-sex couples do not provide the best environment to raise children in.  But heterosexual couples ALWAYS do? What about the rapists, child molesters, murderers, alcoholics, and other harmful personalities are free to marry and procreate and raise children all they want. Yes, there are organizations that help children in those situations but do they get to all of them? And isn't the child already affected negatively from the experience? Gay couples can raise children just as well as straight couples can. The difference is that gay couples are looked down on and that can affect the children and it does. If homosexuals were treated equally then what differences would there be? And would they -really- be significant and worthy of being mentioned in an argument?5) Same-sex relationships are immoral. Says who? Give me valid, unbiased sources and I will acknowledge it and actually have an argument. I will not argue over faith based arguments or personal beliefs.6) Same-sex marriages threaten the institution of marriage. This to be sounds contradictory. By allowing gays to marry we eliminate marriages that some of them would enter with people they do not love and are not fully attracted to. Gay marriages do not threaten the institution of marriage. If anything they simply strengthen it. Divorce, if anything, is what threatens it.7) Same-sex marriages are untested social experiments. This is a very narrow-minded argument because it implies that nowhere in the world have there been same sex marriages, while also degrading the relationships of same-sex couples. Calling someone's relationship and love ""an experiment"" is less of an argument than a personal attack. And same-sex marriages have been ""tested"" and successful in countries such as: Canada, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, etc. It doesn't seem to pose a problem there so why would it in America?To me these arguments are all excuses for the real reasons people oppose gay marriage. The reason I say this is because in each argument there is a flaw or contradictions. It is easy for people to dismiss something they find repulsive, unnatural, or that makes them uncomfortable, but that doesn't make it okay to deny a group of people the right to be married. "
1,"I believe that same sex couples should be able to get married.  When people are in love, they should be able to get married, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Same sex couples should be treated the same as straight couples, and should have the same rights as straight people.  Just because they like someone of the same sex doesn't mean they're any different from people who are straight."
2,"I see some of you are twisting the words and making personal attacks, again. This is the usual fare when you can not make your point through logic. Marraige is plain and simple the joining of a man and woman, period. If you must pervers the meaning of a word to make it fit ""your'e"" definition then it is indeeed a contrived definition. If same sex couples want to live together in wedded bless, let them enjoy their civil unions, this describes it very well lietearly and legally. But convulting the term marraige to suit ""well"" meaning otherwise intelligent people is sheer incompetence. "
1,"Let me start with a simple question.  -Why- is marriage between a man and a woman?  Or, more openly, why was marriage defined as between a man and a woman?"
2,"Though I feel a completely neutral standing when it comes to questions of sexual orientation (meaning that I view homosexuality as neither right nor wrong), I feel that it should not be allowed to have marriage for same sex couples. Marriage is defined as a religious institution. Now, should the individuals be wishing to marry under a religion that feels that their union is acceptable, then their marriage is acceptable. However, should the individuals be trying to be married under a religion such as Islam, Christianity, or any other religion that does not approve of their act, it is violating the rights of that religion to have the government force such a thing to occur. They (the individuals) had willingly agreed to joining the religion, with its preset beliefs and ethics. The government is not in a place to violate their rights. Do I think that same sex marriage is wrong? No. Do I think that it is wrong to ignore the already given rights of a religion, violating them in order for a person's choice (what religion they belong to) to be kept unchanged? Yes."
1,"""Marriage is defined as a religious institution.""Wrong.  Wrong, you're already wrong.Nobody is arguing about whether or not churches should sanction same-sex marriages.  The point in question is civil (secular) marriages.  Religion is absolutely irrelevant when we're talking about secular law.""Do I think that it is wrong to ignore the already given rights of a religion, violating them in order for a person's choice (what religion they belong to) to be kept unchanged? Yes.""How about the Buddhists and the Shinto and the Hindu who don't oppose same-sex marriages?  As a Shinto, I would be offended if my First Amendment rights were abridged solely on the basis of somebody else's First Amendment rights being upheld.  Is it right that my Shinto beliefs be put down for somebody else's Christian beliefs?To clarify, same-sex couples do not and should not request religious institutions to sanction their marriages.  They are and should be appealing to the government to sanction their marriages."
2,"Now, though the pure, clean cut definition of marriage may say that the state or government recognizes their union (which I see no faults with), actual marriage ceremonies are performed for enjoyment and religious sake, in order for their religion to recognize their union. So, is marriage a secular thing? Yes, if the individuals wish to have it be solely the state that recognizes them. I feel that we are arguing for roughly the same thing. I am not saying that the state should not recognize them, and I am not saying that the Hindu faith shouldn't as well. I am saying that if a group does not wish to recognize them, already firmly holds the belief that their act is ""wrong"", it is violating their [the religion's] rights to force recognition. ""To clarify, same-sex couples do not and should not request religious institutions to sanction their marriages. They are and should be appealing to the government to sanction their marriages.""Not fully true. If a same sex couple wishes to have a religious ceremony, then they have every right to do so, if the religion is not being forced to change due to their [individual's] beliefs.""Nobody is arguing about whether or not churches should sanction same-sex marriages.""The topic header chose to generalize marriage and not to restrict this argument. I felt that it was fair for me to argue it.I hope that might better clarify my point and argument and nullify some ""Wrong. Wrong, you're already wrong"" comments. "
1,"How, exactly, does this tie in to your believing that same-sex marriages should -not- be legalized?  (I'm saying this because it says that you're on the ""No"" side of the argument.)"
2,"There is no ""Same sex couples should have the state and federal government recognize their union, but if their current religion disapproves of the union, then they [the faith] should not be forced by law to recognize the union [hold a religious ceremony]"" button. I have no problems with same sex marriage, provided it doesn't infringe on other's rights."

1,"The question should have been worded, ""Should CIVIL marriage for same-gender couples be legal?""  I agree that no religious organization should ever be forced to dispense ANY sacrament or blessing to ANYONE, including the sacramental or religious blessing of a union between ANY two people.  The question under discussion is and should be one of CIVIL rights accorded to citizens and their partners as members of a society."
2,"I believe that   gay marriage   is wrong & should not be legal. as ejones said...1 Corinthians 6:9-11: ""Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be decieved; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, NOR HOMOSEXUALS, 10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such WERE some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but yiou were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God."""
1,"I understand that you believe   gay marriage   is wrong, but I don't understand how you believe it should not be legal. Why is the state compelled to follow your ideas on gay marriage as opposed to some other   religion  's?"
1,"put simply, yes. in this world, but especially in America we have become more accepting of race and views. but there needs to be a point that we as a human race evolve. this needs to occur and will in the next five to ten years.   gay rights   are facing the same problems as segregation did in the thirties and forties. if gay marriage is enacted, will there be fighting? yes. will there be riots? probably, but the goal is to let every man and woman express they're views without accusation, but acceptance. the goal on this planet is to achieve true freedom in thought, view, and actions. Sivan, you said "" I believe that homosexual people will find that they are the recipients of a great deal of enmity and hostility from other people"". well, first of all that's a blanket statement, not every gay man wears rainbow shirts and hits on straight men. and you also said that the source of this hostility are the gay activist organizations. granted, they may have pushed the envelope, but the anti gay organizations are just as guilty."
2,"This is referenced outside of   religion  , since for some strange reason every one wants to funnel the issue into religion.""Marriage"" has been written up and defined as a monogamous legally recognized union between one man and one woman. There are stipulations around this which do not allow a brother and sister for example to marry because of obvious reasons....genetic degradation in offspring. Yes! reproduction comes into the picture here.There is no such thing as traditional or new view where marriage is considered. The components are clear and documented as neither old nor new.""Same sex"" instantly disqualifies the use of the defined term ...Marriage... being that the clearly documented components are already non applicable.The term Union works because the title is open and non stipulated.One solution would be to do away with the term Marriage in vital statistics and documented records and use only the term Couples Union. Include all of the benefits desired such as alimony, dowries rights, insurances,   health care  , tax breaks of a couple etc.If others saw you and noted that you were male and female, it would become obvious that you are Married. If they noted you as being a same sex couple, it would be obvious that you were in a   legal   Couples Union.This is the best that I can offer, but same sex does not meet the criterion of the term ""married"". Traditionally or Newly, either of which there is no such.Same sex people are going to be making commitments to one another and many of these commitments will remain faithful. The same rights should be extended to those commitments on a legal and social level. Not greater not lesser.As for religions.. There should be freedom to express why you don't agree with same sex, but you can't (force) that on same sex choice people. Freedom to choose is where the God of creation is coming from. Freedom to choose blessing or cursing; life or death, but freedom to choose is putting the responsibility upon the chooser. If you wish to precaution in a loving and winning way, your job is then done. You can't exercise force against peoples choices or choose for them.The church has failed hugely by trying to use force instead of winning minds and hearts to upholding it's treasured values. The values upheld by people in the church often become those specific of their choice, and because (same sex issues may be upheld to their values by them) but maybe not financial integrity. They need to uphold it all before dogmatically promoting values in any direction. One disqualifies the other.            "
1,"I don't understand why anyone is against gay marriage! They are people just like us and by denying them the right to marry whomever they want, we are discriminating! It is just like saying that Jewish people are bad or black people are bad! I think if you love someone, no matter what their gender, you should be allowed to love and marry them without it being looked down upon or illeagle! I really and truly don't understand why anyone would be against gay marriage."
1,"First of all I cant figure out why the heterosexual community makes such a huge deal out of this. Straight people run through marriages with no thought about the oath they take before God. If this is so important I would think you need to look at the example you providing your   children   and the world.Second I cant figure out why Gay people want to be married as this is a religous ceremony and the real issue is having the same rights as the heterosexual people. A   legal   union will be as binding if recognized by the state or federal level.Third I can understand the statement that Gay people want to make publicly that they are committed to each other. It is just as important to them as to the straight community.Fourth Unless you are Gay you cannot know what it is like anymore than a Gay person does not have the same feelings as straight people. What is that old saying about walk a mile in my shoes?Fifth I keep hearing that being Gay is a choice. What sane person would just decide to be Gay? I have known that I was Gay since a very early age. I did not want to be different from other people, but I can tell you with no doubt that it is a natural feeling, wrong or right it is not a choice.Sixth Are children raised by a same sex couple missing something? Well of course, children should no how people relate to each other as male and female. But, I think it would be better than being raised by a single parent or in a foster home knowing they are just like a dog in a kennel. They are given what they need, but know that they are not a part of that family. Love is not a sexual issue. Everyone needs love!It seems overall that people are people and none of us are perfect. We should be concerned about each other instead beating down people who happen to be different. Unfortunately we are a selfish species. I hope that God is as loving and forgiving as I was taught as a child."

1,"and I still can't completely decide how I personally feel. I never felt less than married in the two serious relationships I have been in, one for 6 years and one for 13 years.

I do respect the wishes of others and I worked to promote vote against   prop 8   in California because I do think there should be an opportunity for all to marry if they want. So it is more of a struggle for me than a criticism of the whole issue, thanks for your thoughts.'"

Dont even try to say it isnt there is way to much proof otherwise!AP) WASHINGTON - A Duke University official has been arrested and charged with offering his adopted 5-year-old son for sex.Frank Lombard, the school's associate director of the Center for Health Policy, was arrested after an Internet sting, according to the FBI's Washington field office and the city's   police   department.According to an affidavit by District of Columbia Police Det. Timothy Palchak, an unnamed informant facing charges in his own child sex case led authorities to Lombard.Authorities said that Lombard tried to persuade a person -who he did not know was a police officer -to travel to North Carolina to have sex with Lombard's child.The detective's affidavit charges Lombard identified himself online as ""perv dad for fun,"" and says that in an online chat with the detective, Lombard said he had sexually molested his son, whom he adopted as an infant.The court papers say Lombard also invited the undercover detective to North Carolina to have sex with the young boy, and even suggested which hotel he should use.""In response to the AP report, which most of the newspapers used almost verbatim, Mike Adams of Townhall made the observation that ""The Associate Press (AP) did not mention the fact that the five-year old offered up for molestation was black. Bringing that fact to light might be damaging to the political coalition that exists between blacks and gays. Nor did the AP mention that the adopted child is being raised by a homosexual couple.

Also if we open the door to allow homosexual marriages which is clearly against Biblical and Christian beliefs then it would only stand to reason we would allow adultresses to have moral and legal rights to their married partners   money  ,   health   plans, property, salaries, retirment, and oh yah wills too right? And then if we give this right to adultresses why not just open it to polygamous marriage, and then to incestous marriage, and then to beastiality marriage and then to heck just get rid of marriage all together. Do you see how damaging allowing homosexual marriage will be? Probably not so instead here is a question from an ex-adultress to all churches and ministers who feel they can either by pass God and condone homosexuality and adultry or either feel they can stay neutral on these moral subjects : have a question for all ministers out there that are marrying homosexual couples.  This question comes from me, and ex-adultress, I would like to know when adultresses will get the stamp of approval from your   church   too, when will this lifestyle be given moral respectablity and legal rights? When will the minister hail the love and devotion of adultresses in this country?I spent years and years caring for a married man, we bought a house together and a car, went on trips etc but I have no rights as an adultress and if you allow homosexual couples to marry, clearly against the word of Gd, I was wondering how long before you drop all the Godly precepts and boundaries set in place by a wise and loving Gd whose desire is to bless traditional marriage, in lieu of your more enlightened convictions, and allow me to have all the self esteem and protections of the church that you afford homosexuals? So as long as your not following Godly principles you wont mind allowing all adultresses to have the same legal and moral marital rights as the married couple correct? And since you dont care much of what God has to say about blessing Holy matrimony you wont mind if my kissin cousins marry us too?You cant possibly be opposed to one big happy family, now what wouldnt be very tolerable of you, so SEE YOU IN CHURCH. I ll be in the adultress section, just to the left of the homosexual section, and I fully expect to have the full cooperation and support of the church in my lifestyle too. I hope you undertand I am being sarcastic but at the same time I am realistic in the fact that homosexuals have equal rights already in society; they dont want marriage they want to destroy Godly precepts and the parameters set in place for moral edification and protection of the church and Gods people,and some of you ministers are leading us astray. Please consider that all societies need moral guidelines and Godly parameters for a safe and healthy life and country not just  just for the family unit, but   children   and society, as a whole need the church to be the church and a light of higher quality. PS Only an enemy of God would want to condone homosexuality and adultry. I repented and came back to God in 1998 and have by my own choice, not always easy though, taken a vow of celibacy for the past 11 years, per scripture. God is head of my home and for the past 11 years it has been a happy one!"
1," Homosexual spouses can helpfully adopt orphaned children Many children in the United States, let alone the world are orphaned. Same sex spouses frequently adopt children in need of a family. This is highly socially beneficial. A child receives a family and no additional children are added into an over-populated world. And, gay marriage would increase the adoption rate, since many homosexual spouses will want to start a family  just like straight spouses.

The homosexual movement is based on lies and deception, always has been and always will be, and its obvious we disagree on this matter, and I have no reason to beleive what they are saying now in regards to why they feel that civil   unions  /domestic partnerships are not good enough runs the same lines. You are wrong. The homosexual community said that if   marriage   is granted to them they will not use it to sue churches or push agendas in schools, yet they are and will do just that. And the comment on an adultress only needing to marry the man after he gets a divorce...ludacrious ( my spelling sucks sorry) you advocate divorce so someone else can marry...are you serious that is a sorry excuse and what if he doesnt want a divorce but wants a mistress and visa versa, why cant they just be married and have legitimate,   legal  , and acknowledged mistress on the side who is given all the rights a married woman would have....I dont think Im asking for anyting more than what homosexual couples say they dont have and want right? They are intimate, so were we, they share housing, so did we, they spend alot of time together, so did we, they feel married, we did too. Why should one relationship ie homosexual one have precedence over ours? We loved each other dearly and I would have appreciated some respect and acceptablity in   society  .

In a state where same sex   unions   / marriages are not recognized they do not have the same rights as a married couple.And that is the question... Should homosexual couples be able to enjoy the same rights as heterosexual ones.  To me the answer is easily yes... and if they have identical rights then why does the name at the top of the form they sign need to be different?  Legally that name would be the only difference between Civil Unions and Marriage... so why call it something different?""The homosexual community said that if   marriage   is granted to them they will not use it to sue churches or push agendas in schools, yet they are and will do just that.""[Citation needed] on that one.  All the cases loudly trumpeted as 'homosexuals suing churches' that I have seen have turned out to be quite different once the full facts are brought forward.  As an example I'll point to the case where a homosexual couple sued a   church   over the use of their pavilion... that pavilion was rented out to those outside the church, and thus barring homosexuals was an act of discrimination... which would have happened if the church had refused to marry a mixed race couple.""my spelling sucks sorry""I'd recommend using firefox... it has a spell checker that underlines misspelled words and lets you correct them by right clicking on them.

2,"Since homosexual   marriage   became “  legal  ” the rates of   HIV   /   AIDS   have gone up considerably in Massachusetts. This year public funding to deal with HIV/AIDS has risen by $500,000. Citing “the right to marry” as one of the “important challenges” in a place where “it’s a great time to be gay”, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health helped produce The Little Black Book, Queer in the 21st Century, a hideous work of obscene   pornography   which was given to   kids   at Brookline High School on April 30, 2005. Among other things, it gives “tips” to boys on how to perform oral sex on other males, masturbate other males, and how to “safely” have someone urinate on you for sexual pleasure. It also included a directory of bars in Boston where young men meet for anonymous sex. Given the extreme dysfunctional nature of homosexual relationships, the Massachusetts Legislature has felt the need to spend more   money   every year to deal with skyrocketing homosexual domestic violence. This year $350,000 was budgeted, up $100,000 from last year.At my own   children  's high school there was a school-wide assembly to celebrate same-sex “marriage” in early December, 2003. It featured an array of speakers, including teachers at the school who announced that they would be “marrying” their same-sex partners and starting families either through   adoption   or artificial insemination. Literature on   same-sex marriage   – how it is now a normal part of   society   – was handed out to the students.At a school in Mass. a class was held in March of 2000 that is down right criminal. Children as young as 12 were instructed by adults (state employees!) how to perform a range of dangerous and perverted homosexual sex acts, including fisting which became known as the fistgate incident. In September, 2004, an 8th-grade teacher in Brookline, MA, told National Public Radio that the marriage ruling had opened up the floodgates for teaching homosexuality. “In my mind, I know that, `OK, this is legal now.' If somebody wants to challenge me, I'll say, `Give me a break. It's legal now,'” she told NPR. She added that she now discusses gay sex with her students as explicitly as she desires. For example, she said she tells the kids that lesbians can have vaginal intercourse using sex toys.In 2005, when David Parker of Lexington, MA – a parent of a kindergartner – strongly insisted on being notified when teachers were discussing homosexuality or transgenderism with his son, the school had him arrested and put in jail overnight.Second graders at the same school were read a book, “King and King”, about two men who have a romance and marry each other, with a picture of them kissing. When parents Rob and Robin Wirthlin complained, they were told that the school had no obligation to notify them or allow them to opt-out their child. In 2006 the Parkers and Wirthlins filed a federal Civil Rights lawsuit to force the schools to notify parents and allow them to opt-out their elementary-school children when homosexual-related subjects were taught. The federal judges dismissed the case. The judges ruled that because same-sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts, the school actually had a duty to normalize homosexual relationships to children, and that schools have no obligation to notify parents or let them opt-out their children! Acceptance of homosexuality had become a matter of good   citizenship  !In 2006, in the elementary school where my daughter went to Kindergarten, the parents of a third-grader were forced to take their child out of school because a man undergoing a sex-change operation and cross-dressing was being brought into class to teach the children that there are now “different kinds of families.” School officials told the mother that her complaints to the principal were considered “inappropriate behavior.”"
1,"This article essentially invalidates the common argument that, ""If a homosexual couple wants to be together, nothing is stopping them.  It doesn't matter if they are legally married.""  Legal recognition of a marriage is certainly an important issue because with this recognition comes certain rights and protections that are crucial to a couple.  The ability to make hospital visits, to make certain economic decisions, and to guarantee the protection of a partner in the event of death are all examples of rights that a legal marriage provides.  It is unfair to tell a man that he cannot visit his dying partner in the hospital when he cares for his partner in the same exact way that a heterosexual couple cares for one another. "

I dont know how you could even rationalize the fact that opening   marriage   up for a free for all would lead to a stronger society but a much weaker and distorted and psychologically imbalaced one and I hope that they would see that and that realizing that the road to hell is paved in roads such as the one that homosexual marriage will create in America.  It will weaken our family structure and thereby weaken our towns and eventually our country, if you dont think so remember what ERA for woman promised us, better futures more security etc blah blah and what did we actually get? Harder lives, more on our plates, expectations over the limit, family structure that fell apart without the mother role in the house, more   money   but that lead to more bills, more divorce rates because we allievated some of the mens responsiblities and that opened them up to the wondering eye, woman cheating on their husbands.

2," The LAMBDA argument sounds rehearsed or practiced. I do not support ssm, its wrong on so many levels. But I guess one of many of my concerns with this absurd phenomenon is the fact that we know that NAMBLA has very strong and documented ties to mainstream homosexual organizations and ssm is only a front to their attempts to rape little boys. I know you will deny it but the evidence is clear and it does not support you it supports the fact that   children   will be put into harms way if ssm is allowed to be normalized by using traditional legacys ie Holy Matrimony for one man and one woman. FBI agent infiltrates NAMBLA and writes book, "" THE LAST UNDERCOVER "" where he exposes link between homosexual activists and NAMBLA.  I guess the next concern I have which also is documented that ssm if its allowed to take on the name of Holy Matrimony vs Civil Unions would only be an attempt to force   Christians   into accepting the act of   homosexuality   as pleasing to Gd and we do not beleive that it is and we beleive that ssm is only about destroying Christian foundations. We only have to look as far as the latest caper pulled by homosexual activists ie the big kiss-in orgy in front of churches to know that they are about destruction not about building anything.  And I guess lastly I would just like to say that you have all the rights you need in a Civil Union so there is no reason to tear down someone elses belief system so you can walk all over them. I join with millions of others to denounce this hypocricy and ask Gd to help us to stop it from destroying other peoples lives so a minority can feel their jollies."

Marriage has always been and should never be changed from between man and woman.  This is natural.  During hard times in our history, with the lack of a partner of the opposite sex, genders have come together for the comfort and contact experienced from birth.

And religions that believe same sex marriage is ok are just as legitimate as ones that don't, such as Christianity. To suggest they aren't is discrimination."
1,The failure of the courts should not be a reason to deny same sex couples the same rights and privileges.The reason same sex marriage should be legalized is to protect the religious freedoms of others.

We’ve been down this road before in this country and should not kid ourselves that a separate institution just for gay people is a just solution here either. Our constitution requires legal equality for all. Including gay and lesbian couples within existing marriage laws is the fairest and simplest thing to do."" (from the same source cited earlier)Is it such a long stretch to see ""civil union"" become a derogatory term?Starting out with ""civil union"" may bring the illusion of satisfaction.  In this hypothetical situation, once lawmakers confer the same provisions that come with marriages, they could argue that civil unions are ""good enough"", failing to fully realize how a mere word can invite discrimination.Same-sex marriages were already allowed in parts of the world before the 21st century*.  Why do we have to fight for the exact same rights again?*See: Virginia Law Review vol. 79 no. 7, 1993, A History of Same-Sex Marriage by William N. Eskridge, Jr."
1,Refer to all Civil Unions as such and let Churches use the term marriage. The only discrimination would come from churches and that's going to happen no matter what you call it. I simply don't agree with your objections.
1,"...I would have agreed with you.  Forgive me for not having read your entire argument, then."
2,"A   civil union   can be defined just as marriage can be defined.A dog is not a cat. A man is not a woman. A man wedded to two wives is not the same thing as a man wedded to thirteen wives.We went down a long road as a   society   demanding there is no difference between men and women. There is not a little 'expansion slot' in the brain into which a card is inserted that is labeled ""male"" or ""female."" But on the other hand, it did not   add   to the richness of the human experience by failing to note that a man and a woman are different.There is no harm in notating that a man wedding a woman is different than a man wedding a man; and that is different from singleness.Justice does not demand that a single person be defined married for the sake of having access to the same legal and social benefits. Or that a single person in some form of ongoing sexual relationship be defined as a marriage.We could have a long and valued debate as to whether ""marriage"" should receive the social/legal benefits it does (or if it should receive more). But to me, it is silly to deconstruct the meaning of the word for the sake of correcting what we deem to be an inequality.We can go down this road, but it is the equivalent of saying there are only persons instead of being men and women. It answers a question and opens up a larger question. This is not the only route to the needed outcome."
1,"Imagine a contract giving benefits to married couples.Now imagine a ""civilly unionized"" couple trying to obtain the same benefits.Get my drift?"
2,"Marraige is the union between a MAN and a WOMAN.  If it is not between two DIFFERENT sexes, then it is not Marraige.  Civilly Unionized is the word they must use... unless they decide to take the initive to create a new word.  Either way, Marraige is not between a man and a man or a woman and a woman."
1,"Before Loving v. Virginia, marriage was the union between a man and a woman OF THE SAME RACE.Now, don't make the mistake of thinking that I'm equating   same-sex marriage   to interracial marriage. I'm just saying that the definition of marriage can and has evolved in the past."
2,"Allowing gay marriage would cause a number of other principles surrounding marriage to come under attack There are many possible ways in which gay marriage could lead to other attacks on the basic principles of marriage. It is possible that gay marriage will be seen as an opportunity by polygamists and polyamorists to attempt to obtain marriage rights. What logic could stop this if marriage is offered to homosexuals. If the traditional definition of marriage is stretched to include homosexuals, what rationale could prevent it from being stretched to include polygamy and polyamory. The same justifications for gay marriage could be put forward by polygamists and polyamorists; That there relationship is based on love and commitment. And, obviously, if marriage is extended to these groups, the traditional institution of marriage and the principles that it stands on will be damaged.
"
2,"I understand what you are saying however, if marriage keeps 'evolving' soon it could be considered marriage between a chair and a desk.  That is a little to the extreme but where do we draw the line between marriage and just unionized?  Marriage is not going to mean much to those who take it as what it began as. It wouldn't be as special."
1,"""It wouldn't be as special.""  Why should he have the same color ball as I do?  I had one first.  Why should he get ""x"", I didn't get one?  The other   kids   aren't going to think i'm cool if everybody has the same thing I have.Ok, that was midly snippy.  I have seen this ""special"" argument before and I am rather saddened by it.  My 'x' thing (like marriage) is special to me because it is special to me.  It's not more special because you say it is.  It's not less special because you say it isn't.  It is the greatest character flaw in man that we are not always capable of appreciating what we have without the consent, or indeed the jealousy, of those around us.  It is from this that greed stems.  To say that marriage would not be as special because a different group of people now have access to it is both petty and selfish."
1,"As far as the state is (or should be) concerned, marriage is essentially a business partnership between two individuals. They share financial responsibility of property, income, taxes, children, etc.Any factors outside of that partnership are purely dependent upon religion or the personal beliefs of said individuals and therefore should not be regulated by the state as it would violate the separation of church and state and personal rights as provided by the First Amendment."
2,"Ever heard of separation of church and state? It was originally made to keep the state out of the church... No religious institution should be forced to do anything. Religious institutions are supposed to be houses of freedom from cynical, politically correct, immoral, and oppressive natures of society (and i'm not saying this because i'm a regular church-goer. I haven't been to church in months). If a religious institution chooses not to recognize a same-sex marriage, or anything else for that matter, more power to them!"
1,"According to this logic, then, marriage as a civil issue should be separate from the church.The issues for those in support of gay marriage are civil.  It seems that those in opposition are against the state telling the church what to do.I agree with both stances.  So is it therefore logical to no longer commingle church and state activities with legal church-marriages?  That seems like a fine solution to me.Gays just want the rights of marriage, that being state-sanctioning of their marriage which has everything to do with power of attorney, healthcare benefits, and financial death benefits.  Do those who oppose gay marriage really have an issue with those things?  It is not likely (I'm sure there are some yeses) that the majority don't want other people to do as they will.  They simply don't want their religious institution to be dictated by the state as I now understand it.Brady, thanks for clearing this up for me!  So, can we agree to simply separate marriage as separate civil and religious institutions?  Would that appease both sides?"
2,"I really like the reasoning in this thread (leading up to and including your post), but a lot of thoughts/sentiments/ideals need to be ""test-driven"" on this middle path. I want to see that happen because I support it.Personally, I hate debates and yes/no positions...I like it when you watch a person think ideas through and dance around until resting on a position they feel more secure with after the conversation.Here are some opinions I am attempting to paraphrase from various discussion threads on this section of the opposing opinions web site: a)   same-sex marriage   values more than just protections; they want the ""intangeables"" of marriage toob) having civil unions classifying only the same-sex marriage is a fundamental inequality to marriage [which says that separate itself is unequal, and separate but equal will not be agreeable]c) most of the division on this issue is the use of the word marriage in affiliation with same-sex couples, but much fewer will have an issue with ensuring same-sex couples the same [federal/state defined] legal rights as married couples d) any argument about   religious   institutions not recognizing same-sex marriage is reversely encroaching upon the rights of the historical churches by state/federal involvement. [Thus, this violates the separation of   church and state  , which protects our   society   in both directions.]Here are my thoughts as extension of those shared in the post above me:1. why not have a new word that means marriage and is defined by religious institutions that support same-sex relationships?2. why not support that state and federal policies and protections refer to all relationships formed through weddings/ceremonies/courts as civil unions to encompass marriage and any other   religion  -defined relationships in addition to state recognized/defined relationships.Looking forward - the next questions1. If state and federal authorities, back out of the picture after calling everything remotely resembling marriage as a   civil union  , how will the argument approach resolution at the steps of the churches in the US?2. Is this an issue beyond the Christian churches? What about the Jewish faith or Islam? any alternatives for same-sex couples from those religions?"
1,"When does Religious Marriage truly exist beyond the ritual associated with it? You need   legal   documentation to be married according to a number of institutions. Civil Marriage is paperwork. Religious Marriage is ceremonial and is mostly a superstitious event. Does Religious Marriage hold up in court just as well as paperwork that's been documented? I don't understand the difference between the two.All I know about   marriage   is that it's something that cultures did to consolidate two families' resources through arranged marriages and it's also been used as a form of social engineering. Many people have seen it ingrained into their   religion  , which is the origin of Religious Marriage I suppose. The true origin of marriage is pretty arguable and its merits are mostly social and somewhat questionable outside of things like tax codes and religious belief.Two people, no matter what their   race   or gender, may consent to whatever they want with one another? Who cares? If you're gay or straight, it's your business. Not mine. Do whatever you want! And as for hate, if it isn't because of your sexual preference you'd be hated for being fat."
1,"you suggest that opposing gay marriage on the basis of its ""unnatural-ness"" is a completely logical stance.  i find that...strange.the word itself, ""unnatural"" is one of those bogeyman words that in itself means nothing, while saying much of the speaker.  by some standards, it is ""unnatural"" to conduct discussions with people one has never met, nor indeed am ever likely to meet.  while it certainly recalls to mind epistolary debates such as the lively exchange within the screwtape letters, the immediacy we are offered now is certainly unnatural.pointing out that you consider a thing to be ""unnatural"" is not a valid basis for public policy and indeed simply isn't logical.but perhaps more importantly, advancing the ""unnaturalness"" argument reveals the true heart of your objection: that you simply dislike homosexuals.  it has little to do with the subject of marriage per se, and advancing the unnaturalness argument spells that out in blazing, 40' tall letters for all to see."
1,"If homosexuality is unnatural, then surely its behaviour would not be found in humans across the globe; but it is--even in cultures where acting it out is punishable by death. If homosexuality were a construct,  it wouldn't exist in the non-human world , but it does.The forced ideal that homosexuality is 'wrong', is a judgment call.  Living one's life the way that they see fit is not wrong, it simply is.  It's like telling a cat to stop eating meat.  You can do it and get upset, but they'll still catch a bird. America's resistance to sex and sexuality only perturb it and make it dysfunctional.  Judge not.  It isn't your place to tell others how to live their life."
1,"I suspect a philosophical fallacy in the Family Research Council’s argument here. They write, “This response is followed by “the purpose of marriage is to have children” (4 percent), which also recognizes a purposeful – and thus “natural” – design for human sexuality.” This, admittedly, may have some validity. Marriage, as it has been traditionally defined, may imply “procreation.” However, as David Hume argued, questions about what “ought to be” cannot be derived from questions about what “is.” The fundamental question in this debate is: Should two consenting male adults, for example, be allowed the right to marry? To respond as FRC has done, by appealing to what “is” (or what has always been) and therefore what “should be,” is fallacious because these are two fundamentally different questions. As their argument rests on this assumption, it should be questioned for its validity.         "
2," Gay marriage will distract the purpose of marriage from child-rearing, harming child-rearing Homosexual spouses will typically not have child-rearing as a focus, assuming the majority of them do not have or adopt children. This means that the significance of child-rearing in marriage will be further down-played in significance in societies. This will add to social problems of poor, careless parenting.
"
1,"It resurrects itself every 4 years when Republicans need to get out the vote. It inflames (and funds) liberal and conservative support organizations and forces moderate politicians to choose between hate-spewing intolerant right-wingers and a lifestyle that most Americans find distasteful. Thanks Karl Rove!To approximately quote Jon Stewart, I don't have to marry a gay person, right? Just like you don't have to marry someone of another race. or religion. or hair color. The only reason same-sex marriage is not legal is you can't get reelected in most states if you support it. Give the US another 25 years and maybe the general consensus will have changed.The philosophical/religious/parenting debates are incredibly emotional, stirring discussions that attract voters' attention but lead to no resolution. No rational person can agree that somehow limiting two consenting adults from entering a recognized marriage benefits society in anyway. However politics is highly irrational, religious views won't be swayed by research and lobbying organizations don't attract money by avoiding emotionally charged rhetoric.So should it be? Sure. Will it be? Not for awhile."
1,"Otherwise I would be arguing the apparent, but not true, reason for the assertion. To directly refute the assertion - no, homosexuality is not unnatural. It occurs across all cultures, geographies and throughout the history of mankind not to mention in other species of animals. President Ahmenijad of Iran was publicly laughed at when he claimed his country has no homosexuals. By definition since it occurs in nature it is not unnatural. That's a much less interesting response, in my mind, than my original posting.My argument is that this whole line of debate is a manufactured topic employed by politicians who force their opponents into an argument that's irrelevant to most people but so emotionally charged that it attracts attention away from more important topics. It's a very useful tactic for a politician who could not win on the issues with an opponent but knows how to manipulate the electorate for a win. It should be called out as such to push it aside in political debate and make room for more important issues."
1,"--divinely created nature itself. According to the above-mentioned Pew Poll, the next most frequent reason given for opposing gay marriage is that “homosexuality is not natural/normal” (9 percent).--Of course, the problem is that the opinion of those opposing gay marriage does not really matter. Sure, some people may be unfamiliar with the facts and consider homosexuality to be not natural, but surely we have outgrown such primitive logic and come to realize that homosexuality is not only commonly found in nature but also seems to have a (significant) genetic component.As to the divine part, it seems that God managed to create something in which homosexuality was all but unnatural, although perhaps poorly understood by some. However, homosexuality is but one aspect of same-sex marriage and a focus on sex, while understandable given the fascination of some with gay sex, seems rather misplaced."
1,"You've seen those pictures of giraffes with their necks entwined so that their necks form a heart, right? It's on ""LOVE"" cards and greeting cards everywhere. It's perfectly natural, and it's a mating behavior that causes the animals involved to sexually react to each other. But no female giraffe engages in this behavior. Every time you see it, it's two male giraffes.""Cnemidophorus uniparens,"" the whiptail lizard, reproduces after a ritual involving two females. There are no males. The females partogenically lay eggs afterward that produce female babies. This is also clearly ""natural,"" since it's in nature and it's how the species survive.Take out the claim of ""divinely created natural order"" and all you're left with is ""divine creation"" as your argument, which is a matter for individuals, their gods, and their churches, not the judgement of the Family Research Council."
2,"First let me be clear.  As a homosexual, I do not support gay marriage.  I agree with those who believe marriage only between a man and a woman should be legal because the institution provides the optimal framework in our society for raising children.  But let me tell you clearly.  Only one who is a homosexual can determine if it is a normal condition of life.  Apart from the dubious biblical interpretation, your argument is as silly to homosexuals as the idea that red hair is not normal because most people do not have red hair.  "
1,"We all have our likes and dislikes in life, and some of the things we like are not legal because they harm ourselves or others.  Broadly speaking that's what law is based on. The majority of those laws are based on harm to others and harm to oneself.  Homosexuality does not harm others and homosexuals would obviously agree that it does not harm them.  If human beings are taught to fear and hate homosexuals as they very often are, particularly among religious groups, there is going to be an attempt to suppress it.  Fear and disgust of homosexuality is the root causes of all activity to suppress it.Now imagine if you will, a thousand years in the future, humankind is traveling the galaxy and comes across an alien world of alien cultures and alien reproductive habits.  If in those thousand years we have not learned to conquer our fear of homosexuality, how will we ever be able to face the shock of alien cultures on distant planets?We are provincial, paranoid, and feeble to succumb to fear that is behind homophobia. Future generations already show signs of courage and tolerance.  The embarrassing truth is older generations steeped in homophobia are in positions of authority to continue the assault on gays and lesbians."
2,"The design argument is a valid, compeling argument. It is also very simple: Life clearly speaks of design. From a scientific view, it is extreemly improbable that life is here by any other means except a designer. For that fact, is it so improbable that life is here by any other means than a designer, that from an engieering perspective, it is a certainty that a designer behind life exists.Given this, it is extreemly clear that male and female sexual organs are ""desgined"" for each other. Therefore, we as humans, are designed to engage is sexual realtions with the opposite sex. We are NOT desgined to engage in sexual realtions with the same sex.Now to the argument that other species engage is same-sexual relations: The last time I looked, I'm a human. I'm not a giraffe, I'm not an insect, etc... I'm a human. It is also clear that we live in a world that has significant problems. These problems are clearly seem in bad and destructive behariour of man, deseases, etc... The who reason phycologists and counselaors can make a living is that we, as humans have problems. Not only do humans have behavior problems, but there is behavior problems in the animal kingdom as well. In order to show that homosexual behavior in the animal kingdom validates human homosexual behavior, you will need to show that the designer has intended this as normal behavior in the animal kingdom as a whole. Excluding the species that can actually propogate themselves with this kind of behaviour, there is no basis to belive that the designer behind life intends for this to be normative. the further a species is from humans, the less the analogy applies logically."
1,"You say that the reproductive organs of humans are clearly designed for each other; is this not true of all the   animals   who engage in   homosexuality   as well?  Or are these animals 'unnatural'?  And if they are, whatever could their motive be?"
1,"""From a scientific view, it is extreemly improbable that life is here by any other means except a designer. ""There is tons of evidence to show that we evolved.

I'm not a giraffe, I'm not an insect, etc... I'm a human. ""Well guess what! Whether you want to admit it or not, some humans are homosexual just like some   animals   are. So it would seem it is a natural occurrence in all LIFE. ""there is no basis to belive that the designer behind life intends for this to be normative""First of all from reading your comment it is apparently you have very little schooling as you can't spell. Secondly you use the word ""normative"". Homosexuality is not a majority in nature at all... that doesn't mean it's occurrence isn't normal. Just like a previous commenter said... just because red haired people aren't the majority doesn't mean they aren't normal.AND we come to the root of your false reasoning:""you will need to show that the designer has intended this as normal behavior in the animal kingdom as a whole.""No wonder you don't know anything about   science  . You look to your invisible friend as a starting point for a line of reasoning. I'm sorry, but to demonstrate whether something is a fact we do not need to pick up a   bible   and try to fathom what some mythical being thinks about it! We do just fine without first presuming a   god   exists and working from what we can demonstrate in the real world."
1,Homosexuality is just having feelings for someone else. That's not unnatural.
2," The definition of marriage can be traced throughout history, regardless of religion, in ALL societies from primitive to developed. The very fabric of civilization is woven in and through families, which start in marriage. For a society to lower the definition of marriage to any ceremony between consenting adults is to obliterate that societies respect for the institution and function of marriage. 
"
1,"I don't believe homosexuality is unnatural, but, even if it was, why does it matter?Air conditioners are unnatural.Televisions are unnatural.Phones are unnatural.Computers and the internet (and all of technology) are unnatural.Even marriage is unnatural, because it's a legal agreement between two people and the state, it doesn't occur anywhere else in nature: only humans marry.Allowing gays to marry isn't advocating homosexuality or anything like that, it's simply allowing gays to marry, so it isn't advocating unnaturalness, so why does it matter if gays marry?Anyway, we learn about computer programs in school, is that promoting unnaturalness?"
1,"""Those who would reject this law find themselves in opposition to the Divine intent for mankind, a reality that every culture from the dawn of civilization has either recognized – or failed to acknowledge at its peril.""Oh, that's convenient.  All civilizations have condemned homosexuality.  And those that didn't... well, they died -because- they didn't condemn homosexuality.  The other civilizations fell for other reasons.As for past civilizations who did not condemn homosexuality... I'm currently doing research, and my list looks something like this:Zuni community (late 19th c.)Roman community (4th c.)Egypt (2600 B.C.)Mesopotamian codes (2375 B.C., 2100 B.C., 1750 B. C., 1726 B.C., circa 800 B.C.)Plato and other contemporary philosophers (4th c. B.C.)Classical Greek philosophers (Cicero and Curio, no date)Native Americans (1500s - 1800s at least)Not comprehensive in the least, and clearly not all civilizations condemned homosexuality."
1,"If FRC could prove that an overwhelming amount of people think homosexuality is unnatural, what would that mean?  Just many people think homosexuality is unnatural does not mean that it actually is.  Still, if FRC could demonstrate that homosexuality was unnatural, why would it matter?  Why is something that is “unnatural” immoral?  Why do we place so much trust in the dictates of nature?  FRC would say that the law of the Lord is against homosexuality, in that, if homosexuality is against nature, homosexuality is against God and His nature.  That might work for a theological argument, but in this context, we’re wondering what policy our government should take.  The government rules over a people free to practice any creed, or lack thereof, and to guide the government by religious dogma, or ideas derived from that dogma, is to impose articles of faith on the People.  We cannot allow our government to veer from secularism; else, our government threatens our civil liberties and our freedom of religion.  When our officials make decisions, they must use secular reason, else they stand to threaten the establishment of religion."
1,"This may be a question that many have considered already, but I feel that it's fundamental. If it wasn't natural for somebody, why else would it exist? Why would there be homosexuals at all if it was ""unnatural""? Unless it is some kind of innate attraction, how would it have come about in the first place? Has the proposer of this question yet considered this?"
1,"If homosexuality is so unnatural why are there so many homosexual people? For those who look at it from a religious standpoint: If God felt being homosexuality was as unnatural as you claim it to be, why would he allow it to happen in so many instances? These things should be considered. I don't think anyone has the right to claim that a sexual preference is wrong and that their preference is the one that is ""normal"" or ""correct""."
1,"First, advocates of   gay marriage   are not anti-marriage or anti-family.  Opposite sex couples who love each other and wish to get married and have   children   may continue to do this, just as they've always done.  The change?  Same sex couples who love each other want similar legal rights.  Second, the law should not be based off of   religion  .  It is important for a   society   to have morals; individual rights and freedom should be protected, whether it's their   right to life  , property, or opinions.  But the majority should not be able to take rights from the minority.  Besides, not everyone is Christian, or believes that nature was divinely created.  As a   secular   state, why should the Bible supersede the Constitution?Christian beliefs and dictates apply only to those people who choose to believe in them.  There is no way to justify forcing others to follow them.And then- innate realizations?  Please.  For something to be innate, it would have to be agreed upon widely, consistently, and from birth.  No exceptions.  Even if I were the only one who feels that homosexuality is nor unnatural, it would be enough to prove that the concept is not innate.   "
1,"As a gay person and advocate. I have yet to read any type of document, order, newspaper article etc that prints out a ""Gay Agenda"" Lord knows no two gays can agree on anything let alone an agenda. If you have such a copy please Print it out here as that way we all can see what our plans are. As for gay marriage, No   religion  , I said NO religion or   bible   prohibits gays or str8's from getting married. In fact the Catholic church has ceremonies that were used in the past for just such type of marriages. My god ( Budda ) does NOT prohibit such marriages at all. Nor do most religions in the world. Many Christian churches allow such unions. So to say that it is abnormal is your only arguement and that one is bogus also.  Nature itself has gay couples, Penguins, Horses, cows, elephants, birds, bats, and so on. So that arguement is bogus also. I suggest you study nature and you will see that it is a fact of nature.

1,"That's a long list... but in going over it I've got to say that I doubt that they are all homosexuals.  Looking at Charles Manson the only evidence of   homosexuality   I can see is one instance early in life.  Indeed he seemed to prefer the company of women almost exclusively.You seem to be rather stuck on this notion that all homosexuals are brutal, child molesting, killers... and that hardly matches the statistical evidence.  The majority of women are raped by straight men... so do you consider all straight men rapists?  African Americans commit crimes... does that make all of them criminals?"
2," And I believe based on all the literature Ive read and the behaviors Ive seen and experienced from the homosexual community is the only reason, besides the sad attempt to destroy the concept of a moral institution we call holy matrimony, is to adopt little   children  . You say you doubt that the men I mentioned above could all be homosexual,despite their own admissions and sexual appetities, but you are very wrong, they were, by all standards set by those in the homosexual community are homosexual according to the misguided information that   homosexuality   is not a choice to be made but a born condition,something that despite the fact we have free will they have no CONTROL over and are subject to its every whim, despite genetic proof, so if anyone did live out their homosexual fantasies that would make them homosexual by definition of the homosexual community. However, I find it upsurd that so along as the lines of are obscenely defined by the homosexual community that the definition of homosexuality becomes fluidly convienent when they wish to undermine a practicing homosexual. How they can find some loophole that excludes a persons sexuality, in these cases, homosexuality from ""true"" homosexuality, which is, a whole new class they could teach our children in school , oh yes children you can practice homosexuality and not really be a true one of us unless we give you your own card as proof of your TRUE homosexuality. It appears that whatever they desire to use as the current up to the minute  definition of homosexuality even if that definition holds absolutely no medical or scientific basis is taken as fact. Now lets let these individuals that make up this pseudo-sexuality teach our young boys how to dress like woman and maybe someday our enemies will say on the news.....WE GOT AMERICA BY GETTING THEIR CHILDREN!! I dont know, just a mother who witnessed the   murder   of a 17 yo boy trying to fight for his life when a homosexual man tried to rape him..oh yah and they attacked me."

Homosexuality injures the fabric of society, especially   children  . 3. Homosexuality does not offer the stability of a traditional family.6. Homosexuals have a much higher incidence of domestic violence.7. Homosexuals have a much higher rate of molestation than Heterosexuals8. Homosexuality is not condoned in the Bible.9. Homosexuals want to redefine   marriage  , changing the uniqueness of heterosexual marriage.10. Homosexual marriages will lead to other “unnatural”   unions  11. Homosexual marriage is not a “right”.13. God did not intend for same sex relationships to exist.14.

1,"""man and a woman joined together in holy matrimony is the time-tested “yardstick” for marriage""this is simply not true, as is evidenced by the many, many wives of certain rulers of antiquity.  that too was considered ""time-tested"" in its day.  the ultimate failure of many appeals to tradition--which this is--is that it seeks to artificially define one point in human history as the golden standard against which all other periods must be measured, but ignore previous such periods, which are usually in direct contradiction to such a decision, as even a cursory review of biblical genealogy will reveal.the argument as presented amounts to little more than simple fearmongering about some cataclysimic consequences never actually identified yet which are somehow supposed to be inevitable.  this has some admitted rhetorical force, but no logical force, because all actions have unforeseen consequences.  this is known in some circles as chaos theory."

If each one of us would simply concentrate on making sure that our own lives were decent and productive without trying to disrupt others’ lives, this world would be so much more peaceful and harmonious!

The link provided doesn't actually include any justification for this argument either.  All I can see offered is the ""yardstick"" metaphor, which doesn't really make sense.  Yes, changing the definition of a meter (not ""yardstick"" which is not a defined measurement) would be a problem.  It would be tough to know how long a yard is.  I don't see how that extrapolates to marriage... are you suggesting that if gays marry, heterosexual couples who've been married for years will not know if they're married or not anymore? If anything, I think traditional marriage is harmed by the high divorce rate, green card marriages, Britney Spears getting married for a weekend, etc.  Even then, how is any traditional ""sacred"" marriage harmed?  If your marriage is sound, it will not be affected by the actions of other people."

1,What about those Christian Churches that marry homosexuals?
1,"It seems to me that most of the confusion here has to do with the usage of the term ""marriage"" in both a legal and a religious sense. When you write ""the real thing"" here, I think you fall into that same trap. What defines the real thing? You mean marriage as a sacrament, or at least marriage as sanctioned by your religious framework.My question to you: how do you feel about people outside of your religious community getting married? Their rules for marriage are different from yours (some slightly, some vastly). Do you think that anyone with a set of expectations for marriage that differ from yours is cheapening marriage for you and those like you? If so, what you are advocating is a ban on all marriages of people with other faiths. If not, you disagree with your own argument. Christian marriage is no more harmed by homosexuals being married than it is by Jews or Muslims getting married. (I could just as easily have written Catholic marriage vs. Methodist or Presbyterian, for that matter.)"

1,"""...no society has ceased to regulate sexuality within marriage as defined as the union of a man and a woman, and survived."" The Roman Empire only fell after it banned gay marriage. Native American cultures used to have gay marriage but no longer do as a result of practices like, oh, the Spaniards setting dogs on them. The cultures still survive today, just in tiny numbers. It has nothing to do with their marriage practices and everything to do with having someone else come in and build an empire on top of them. The first hit were the Aztecs and Mayans, who did not accept homosexuality."
1,"The exessive divorce rate degrades the principal of marriage much more than two same-sex persons making (and keeping!) a commitment to each other. Every day it seems I am bombarded by a co-worker who is now going through a divorce. Not to mention, that it is none of our buisness, and doesn't bother or hurt my marriage at all. My psyche is much more damaged by the heterosexual couples murdering each other plastered all over the news, than the pictures of other couples getting married. We all deserve the same happiness, and joy where we can find it."
1,"I believe this to be true because there are more obstacles to overcome to get married. Heteros are *expected* to get married, and will, at times, even when not prepared.  When barriers to marriage are removed for same-sex couples, then it will even out. "
1,"What is “holy” matrimony?  What is it that makes it so “holy”?  I assume that to be “Holy” something most likely derives from a religious purview.  So then, matrimony must be in line with our religious beliefs at some level.  But even if we could widen the net and make a definition of marriage that is conciliatory with every religion, what about those people who have no religion?  I hope we agree that the government cannot impress religious dogma or interfere with the religious reestablishment—but if an idea cannot be rationalized through anything other than religious, then it might as well be religious dogma, and therefore it cannot be imposed on the People.  Would the Protestants be happy if Catholics prohibited meat on Lenten Fridays?  What if Christians prohibited Muslim girls from wearing a headdress?What exactly is the “fundamental sexual complementariness of male and female”?  Now, I understand that the penis fits quite nicely into the vagina, and that copulation is usually effective for producing children.  And I would not think it unreasonable that this is the product of   evolution  , or the hand of God.  Yet, these design elements serve to carry on the human race—to say that man and woman should be together just because their genitals say they should is reading morality from an irrelevant biological function.  Marriage is about love and happiness, and the only way the idea of gender complementariness could dictate marriage is if marriage was meant to produce children.  I know some people believe that is a purpose to marriage, but this wouldn’t be America if the government dictated what kind of marriage even heterosexual people should have."
1,"Cool.  Believe whatever you want to believe, but the First Amendment does not give any religious institution the right to enforce its ideas and actions upon any other individuals.In other words, all arguments regarding God, Christianity, etc. are moot."
1,"While the teachings of the Church are clear that homosexuality is unnatural, to make blanket statements that “the followers of the Catholic Church believe that homosexuality is wrong” is not only false, but, as a Catholic, one that I take personal offense to.  The Church is one of the largest religious denominations in the world, among Christians and among all faiths, encompassing over one billion people.  There are many faucets of Catholicism unique to the faith, but, even though public deviation is not well tolerated, dissent does occur, even in the church hierarchy.  As for the faith of the laypeople, it is often a personal matter and faith does not necessary lay contingent on complete adherence to dogma, but rather the belief of at least the core principles of Catholicism.I believe that is the will of God that we should respect other peoples’ religious beliefs, and that to join Church and State at any level would be to force, in this case, the Catholic faith upon all people of the United States.  I think it is un-Christian and un-Catholic to do such a thing, and so I invite you to give a logical, not theological, argument against gay marriage."
1,"According to the Family Research Council, ""A man and a woman joined together in holy matrimony is the time-tested “yardstick” for marriage"".  So because homosexuality was not allowed one hundred years ago and same-sex marriage was the only right way that makes it the ""yardstick"" of tradition?  Tradition is not always best.  In many cases, with time comes knowledge and we are able to reform our ways for the better rather than relying on the beliefs of the past.  It could be possible that in the next twenty years a new invention will replace the yardstick, even though now we can't see that possibility."

1,"This is a poor argument since it presumes that traditional marriage would not be upheld and that there are no obvious instances of discrimination. First of all, the value of traditional marriage is in no way reduced by extending this right to other parties. Second of all, people who are not married face a myriad of issues which their married counterparts do not face such as access to one's partner when in hospital, access to healthcare, insurance, and more. While more and more companies are adapting their policies, it requires an act by government to extend the same rights across all, and the only reasonable approach is to recognize same sex marriages as no different from 'traditional marriages"".Certainly the argument that it somehow trivializes 'traditional marriage' would be a flawed one, the argument that same sex relationships face no discrimination is easily laid to rest by pointing to some self evident facts to the contrary.And so far I have failed to hear any good reason why marriage for same sex couples should be kept illegal?"
1,"Allowing gay marriage would reduce pressure on gays to marry straight, which often leads to divorce and the undermining of the institution of marriage Homosexuals marrying straight can cause terrible emotional and social strife. By denying marriage to homosexuals, the legitimacy of homosexual relationships is denied, and greater pressure is put on homosexuals to marry straight to meet social standards. This has consequences. Allowing gay marriage would decrease this damaging social pressure on gays to marry straight, which can lead to broken marriages, broken families, and even subsequent suicide.

If they are committed to the position that “great numbers represent justification” then, would they similarly react to polls in the 80’s that showed an overwhelming disapproval of making “spousal rape” a crime (i.e., wives are the property of husbands)? Or polls throughout the 50’s, 60’s and 70’s that approved of “Jim Crow” and racial separation? On this line of reasoning, these policies are seemingly justifiable.

A man can fall in love with a man just like a man can fall in love with a woman. And who says marriages between a gay couple won’t last? Now days, opposite-sex married couples are getting divorces left and right, what about their children? Should getting divorced be illegal because of that reason too? Other people are free to live their lives happily without the whole world scrutinizing who they fall in love with. Why should they get to dictate how those who are gay get to live?

All of these polls cited here are from 2003-2004—if there hasn’t been a more recent poll, given the proposition out in California and the election, I’d be quite surprised—are over four years old and do not reflect the current political trends in the American public.

The accuracy of polls is always unsure and I highly question the results of some of the polls listed in this argument.  Second, whether or not most people agree with banning same sex marriage or not is essentially irrelevant.  Majority does not necessarily rule in this country.

1,"I couldn't keep a straight face reading this. It would also have helped you realize your last sentence isn't even a sentence.To put more care into rebutting your argument than was put into framing it:A parent can't marry their child because it would be psychologically abusive; the parent is in a position of authority over their child. This is not comparable to relationships between consenting adults.Two- to three-partner marriages have died out not because of wisdom, but because of social equality between the sexes and the rise of industrialization, which means money is no longer represented in land, families are more mobile socially and geographically, and marriages have lost diplomatic value. It means that a rich man no longer needs to collect wives as representatives of the land he's acquired and tokens gathered to assure good relations with his neighbors. Polygamy and polyandry are also usually inequal-power relationships. None of this has anything to do with two unrelated adults who are in love, want to marry, and cannot based purely on the laws of the society they live in. "

1,"Marriage does NOT mean that both Moms and Dads matter. Of course it is true that Moms and Dads matter, but that has nothing to do with the topic under discussion which is ‘Should Marriage for Same Sex Couples be Legal? Nowhere in the dictionary within the various definitions of marriage, is there mention of Moms and Dads. There are marriages where there are no children.  Should there then be legalization of marriage for same sex couples as long as both parties have agreed not to have children?There are single-parent families which raise exceptional children. Just look at President Bill Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. They turned out quite well. I have no doubt that there are single Dads who also raise great children. There are also two-parent families whose children grow up to be terrible citizens. Yes, there may be valid reasons for someone being against legalization of marriage for same-sex couples, but I do not feel that your premise is validated by your example. "
2,"Popular culture has labeled the issue, as has this website, a question of ""should marriage for same-sex couples be legal?""The question can be asked another way, which those for same-sex marriage like to avoid: ""Should we change the definition of marriage?""Marriage as it stands is one of the central cultural institutions in Western Civilization and 3000 years of wisdom as well as countless scientific studies show that a good mother and father are the best situation to raise a child in.  Does this mean other situations can't be good?  No.  It just means other situations are better.Same-sex marriage expands the definition of marriage, and in doing so, states that having two mommies is just as good as a mommy and a daddy.  This denies the inherent differences between men and women and their value to child rearing.If we can redefine marriage, saying we know better than 3000 years of human wisdom because our hearts tell us so, doesn't that mean we can have compassion for any change?"
1,"Marriage from a legal standpoint is simply a contract between two people that gives certain legal rights and responsibilities and affects property ownership.  If you're talking about the sacrament of marriage, i.e. religious ceremony, you can exclude homosexuals all you want.  The law is not the same as religion, however. This issue is about the legality of ""marriage"" as recognized by the state. Legal marriage does not mandate, require, or even encourage children.  Society encourages children.  If you have a problem with children who aren't raised by a mother and father, you need to try to bring about societal and attitude changes, not trying to suppress the civil rights of a group you dislike. If you don't think homosexuals should be allowed to raise children, that's an adoption issue. All you're doing by fighting gay marriage is ensuring that children of homosexual couples will have unmarried parents.  Is that somehow better?"
2,"The sacrament of marriage is the exact reason why the laws concerning marriage were created.  We wouldn't have ""marriage"" as a concept if it weren't for   religion  .  Society, though, doesn't in fact encourage   children  .  If you look at Western Europe, their birth rates are well below replacement and dangerously close to societal collapse despite their natalist government policies.  The United States is leaning towards those dismal numbers itself.I am first and foremost about children in my opposition to   same-sex marriage  .  We are already seeing vast changes in culture in the states that have adopted same-sex marriage.  These states are shutting down Catholic   adoption   agencies by forcing   the law   (same-sex marriage is   legal  ) to take precedent over their religion in their adoption agencies.  Same-sex marriage starts to trample   religious freedom   even if it is ""only"" a legal issue.The other major cultural shift is in that a school can no longer (and religious institutions lest they violate ""hate laws"" or discriminate) hold up traditional opposite-sex marriage as the normal, optimal solution to a child.  Confusing children at an early age as to whether they should marry a boy or a girl is not good for children still in the development stages.  Claiming that it doesn't matter whether a child marries a boy or a girl is equivalent to   society   saying that girls are the SAME as boys.  This is patently false... men and women are EQUAL, but NOT the same.I agree that societal and attitude changes are required about marriage.  Our out-of-wedlock birthrate in the US is staggering, and the statistics about children raised in single parent households are appalling.  That being said, legalizing, and therefore societal endorsing, same-sex marriage says that our society doesn't care that a child has a mother and father.  We have taken that option off the table.  Adoption agencies are not allowed to discriminate and favor a married opposite-sex couple over a same-sex one anymore, which deprives children of a mother and father.  A same-sex couple is obviously a wonderful option for a child that is in foster care or in dire straights, but society needs to be able to favor an opposite-sex couple over a same-sex one in adoption.  A child has a right to a mother and father when it is possible.Additionally, the whole notion that it is ""discrimination"" is ridiculous, no offense.  Same-sex marriage is a NEW right.  Everyone has the right to marry someone of the opposite sex.  I will inevitably hear the rebuttal of how inter-racial marriages were illegal, and that is a non sequitur.  There is no difference between the races, but there are staggering differences between men and women.  Everyone has the right to marry someone of the opposite sex, but some individuals are predisposed towards someone of their sex, be it by genetics, nurture, or nature or some combination.By redefining marriage, we have not only thrown the notion that men and women are different out the window, we have necessarily changed that definition to allow anyone to marry anyone if it is consensual.  There is no reason, therefore, that three people cannot marry into a polygamous relationship if it is about consensual decisions between any persons.  There is a reason that thousands of years of human history have evolved to this point; that marriage is between a man and a woman, and that reason is being torn down.I have the utmost compassion for gays and their situation, but that does not mean I forsake my standards and ignore the consequences of such a change because of my emotional ""compassion.""Thanks for the discussion."
1,"Where did   the law   come from?  I don't know, and I appreciate your thoughtful explanation, but you have made a large number of assumptions in your argument.  Unfortunately, my profound skepticism and love for the truth prevents me from accepting your assumptions outright without any evidence or explanation of why you think it's safe to make them.  So if you truly want to convince me, and I honestly am open-minded, you will need to give me some more information about these assumptions.  For clarity's sake, I will go through each of your paragraphs in order and ask questions where I need more clarification.  1.  First of all, I was not aware that the concept of marriage would not exist without   religion  .  Can you please give me some more information about which religion invented the concept of marriage, or perhaps point me in the direction of where you learned this?  I have not learned this in my studies, which admittedly have not been exhaustive.  As for birth rates, I am familiar about the low birth rates in some countries, but I do not see what that has to do with gay marriage.  If I had to guess, I would think that you mean to say that countries that are less religious have fewer   children  , but I do not see how that relates to the legality of gay marriage.  Remember, this debate is about whether gay marriage should be   legal  , not about religious views on gay marriage.  If you want to argue that laws should be based on religion you are welcome to do so, but I'm not a huge fan of theocracy myself.  I am a huge fan of the US Constitution, personally.  2.  I am not familiar with the shocking violation of   religious freedom   that you mention here, and would like to read more about it.  Could you provide a little more detail so I can do some research?  Names of the agencies involved, name of a court case, which state/time period... any of these things would help me to find more detail about the cases involved.  3.  ""Confusing children at an early age as to whether they should marry a boy or a girl is not good for children still in the development stages.""  In this statement you have assumed two things a) if it is legal for homosexuals to marry, children will be confused about who they want to marry, and b) such confusion is harmful to the child in a way that you did not specify.  This may be correct, but again I have not seen the evidence, could you tell me where I could read more about these claims?  ""Claiming that it doesn't matter whether a child marries a boy or a girl is equivalent to   society   saying that girls are the SAME as boys.""  Here, you have inadvertantly committed a logical fallacy.  The two claims are not equivalent.  Here, I'll show you:  ""It doesn't matter if a business owner is a woman or a man.  Therefore, women and men are the same.""  The two are not equivalent.  If you think they are, do you mean to suggest that women should not be allowed to own small businesses?  Of course not, you made no such claim because the scientific that men and women are not biologically identical is not the same thing as a society standard about what men and women should or should not be allowed to do.  4.  I'm sorry, I did not say that changes in societal attitudes are required.  I do not think that I have the right to dictate what others are allowed to believe.  I do have personal standards which differ from the most common societal views, but I do not really feel compelled to demand that others change their views to be like me.  As much as I'd love for us to agree about something :)  Your notion that something being legal means that society ""endorses"" it confuses me, if you care to clarify this position I'd love to hear it.  And the rest of this paragraph appears to be your complaints about   adoption     law  .  As I mentioned in my original post, if you think the adoption laws should be changed, then you're in the wrong place.  This debate is about whether homosexual couples should be allowed to get married, not about whether they should be allowed to adopt children.  If you feel that's a problem, why aren't you against gay adoption?  Why gay marriage?  And finally, it's great that you care about the rights of children, but all children do have a mother and father, as far as I know... maybe I missed human cloning coming into vogue?  I think you mean to say that you think all children have the right to be raised the way that you think is most appropriate.  Do you also feel that we should enact laws dictating how parents are allowed to raise children?  It's fine with me if you do, I'm just trying to understand your argument.  (this was too long, so there will be a part 2)"
1,"5.  You were right to say ""no offense,"" because as a member of a heterosexual, interracial couple I am tempted to take offense.  The right for me to marry my boyfriend was also once a NEW right.  Your claim that there are differences in gender but not race lead me to think you are talking about genetics.  If I'm understanding your argument correctly, you seem to be saying that it's fine to treat groups differently under   the law   if their DNA is different.  Am I understanding your argument correctly?  That also troubles me.  I do not like the idea of establishing   legal   precedent that equal protection under the law can be discarded based on genetics.  Surely you can see how that might be abused.  6.  I do not understand how allowing homosexual couples to marry implies that men and women are identical.  I also do not understand your next sentence.  It is false that if gay marriage were legal, that would mean that polygamy would be legal.  The reason that polygamy would not be permitted if gay marriage were legal is that polygamy is illegal under separate laws.  I believe you are trying to say that you think that if gay marriage becomes legal, that automatically means that polygamy will become legal.  This is a straw man fallacy, because you have presented no evidence that this is true.  I do not believe any such evidence exists, unless you have the ability to see the future, in which case surely you have something better to do with your time than argue with me :)  Finally, you say ""there is a reason"" that gay marriage is illegal, but you do not specify what it is.  If there is a reason, name it.  Your assertion that the current situation is automatically best because ""thousands of years of human history have evolved to this point"" is laughable.  I'm sorry, but it is.  In the 1940s, thousands of years of human history had evolved to the Holocaust.  Does that mean the Holocaust was good?  The true history of humanity is a tale of ups and downs, of progress and regress.  Humanity has made some serious bad calls, but they seemed like good ideas to the people of the time.  If you truly believe that the status quo is good and the current change is bad, you need a better argument than ""this is good because it's how things are.""  (if you want to be taken seriously, anyway)7.  What is the ""situation"" of the gays to which you refer?  It's also interesting to me that you put the word compassion in quotes, as I see no compassion for gays (and their mysterious ""situation"") on display in your argument.  However, I am open-minded and realize that you are probably telling the truth and are not just some bigot, so if you'd like to provide examples of times when you have demonstrated compassion for homosexuals, I would be delighted to hear that evidence as well.  No problem, I always make time for courteous and rational discussion. "
2,"I actually replied with a long post, answering point by point, but it was lost somehow.  It made me rethink the issue, so I'll provide a few answers to your questions and then reframe the issue.2)   http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/03/11/catholic_charities_stuns_state_ends_adoptions  / - Sadly, the Catholic agency had to choose between their beliefs and   law  . The State, which mandated that same-sex marriages were equal to traditional marriages, made it impossible to differentiate legally.4) As you can see, codifying   same-sex marriage   as equal in law DOES force your beliefs on others.  Either the Catholic   adoption   agency agrees with same-sex marriage, or it must close down.  If that is not coercion, I don't know what is.Now for a little reframing.  My hope is that you would attempt to see the issue from the opposite side, although I am a little discouraged that you think it is my responsibility to prove ""when I have demonstrated compassion for homosexuals.""  My hope is that, as an informed women who cares about the issue enough to debate someone on a site like this, you would research these issues. I encourage you to read up on many of the religious issues surrounding same-sex marriage in Europe and the US, as well as read some intellectual discussions from the pro-traditional marriage side. I certainly am not the most eloquent spokesman, but one must first disregard the notion that opponents are either bigots or not progressive in their thinking (and therefor dumb).  You certainly don't get any intellectual debate about the issue in the New York Times or on CNN.The problem with the whole issue is that gays think the marriage issue is all about gays.  It has barely anything to do with gays frankly, and every attempt to change the definition of traditional marriage in American   society   is met with the same attempt to stop it.  The issue is that marriage, as defined as the union between one man and one woman, should be kept that way for the good of society.  Utah wasn't allowed into the Union until it changed its incorrect definition of marriage to that of the United States.Do you think that marriage between one man and one woman, especially in regards to the raising of   children  , is the ideal for society?  Does it make no difference if a child has two mothers instead of a mother and a father?Ignoring the difference between the sexes is required to disregard this ideal. Thinking that a male and a female parent in a loving married relationship do not bring something different to the table than two loving gay parents is just untrue.The point is that traditional-marriage advocates are arguing FOR the ideal of opposite-sex marriage for the betterment of society, and not against any group in particular.It most certainly is not a discrimination issue for gays, even though it is constantly touted as one.  There is no difference between a caucasian man and an asian man other than cosmetic difference.  There are huge differences between men and women.  This is why we have girl scouts and boy scouts, but not white scouts and asian scouts.  We should as a society be able to differentiate in our laws regarding different things, and gays currently have the same right to marry someone of the opposite sex as everyone else.  Gays just don't choose to because of their genetic/nature/nurture/biological differences.  Allowing equal rights in visitation, inheritance, etc should obviously be law, and currently it can be law in many cases through contracts between individuals, but where not it should be made so.In order to make it a discrimination issue, therefor, we would have to change the definition of marriage from ""the union of one man and one woman"" to ""the union between individuals who love each other.""  In this case, there is no rational argument one could make against any grouping of consensual, loving humans joining together in a ""marriage,"" including polygamy and intra-family marriage, which is why that definition is not true.I hope this helps, and I appreciate the discussion.  My main goal merely is to at least get others to think a few steps beyond the initial emotionality of the issue.  What's good for individuals on an micro scale is not necessarily good for society.  Thinking past ""stage 1,"" though most people do not, is imperative to understanding any issue.  Thinking about the consequences wrought on children as they are taught in school that there is no ideal for marriage or relationships, about the consequences on men and women as marriage becomes any arrangement one pleases, and denying the differences between the value of men and women in child-rearing can have vast consequences that are unknowable.  Making such a momentous change in society should be thought out, and at least voted on behind a banner a little more well-thought out than ""Prop H8"" or ""Equal Rights."""

2,"Each child needs a father and a mother in their upbringing to model both. There is ample evidence that when either are missing, poverty and dysfunction increases (however noble the efforts of the single parent).

They can never adequately define ""social boundaries"" because they have compromised the most basic biological boundary. 
"
2,"3000+ years of human wisdom extends to every major civilization on Earth.  Western Civilization was mentioned obviously because of its Christian roots for the last 2000 years, but that does not mean marriage between same-sex couples was the norm in any civilization on Earth through history.Suddenly, in the 21st century, we have a generation of people who believe that they are smarter than every one of those generations before.  None of those generations were right, and this new generation is FAR smarter and knows better than   same-sex marriage   is good for   society  .  That arrogance is appalling, as great as we would feel about seeing same-sex couples feel validated."
1,"Humans progress. We expand. We evolve. We become better. In a thousand years, they'll have ideas and systems and beliefs that are better then our current ones."
2,"And they'll also have a lot of ideas that are worse.  As I replied to ""Blue Linchpin"" below, there are a myriad of ideas in the last few millenia that have been worse than previous ideas.  Communism, Fascism, Racism (which is far newer than we are taught) come to mind, but there are plenty of others that show that ""human progress"" is an illusion.  Yes we make material progress, but that does not mean we always make moral progress."
1,"""Communism, Fascism, Racism (which is far newer than we are taught)""Communism, in a sense, has always existed... it just was never formally codified.  As an economic / political system it can work on a small scale (single tribes or family group), though it falls apart when projected over a larger group.Fascism is just authoritarianism repackaged.  There were many brutal tyrants before Fascism existed (and I'm sure that there will be many more).Racism has always been part of the human condition...  It is the idea that ones own social group (such as a tribe or nation) is superior to all others.""Yes we make material progress, but that does not mean we always make moral progress.""We have been making great strides.  Slavery, as a global institution, has been all but eliminated... and it no longer exists as a   legal   entity in much of the world.  The rights of women have been expanding... to the point where in nearly every country they have the right to own property and vote."
2,"No offense, but your reading of history is a bit mistaken.Communal societies may have existed, but that does not make them communist.  The idea evolved overtime, and only after the concepts of States, corporations, and human rights could an idea like Communism be invented by Karl Marx.Fascism is the same way.  Fascism is necessarily authoritarian, though it is used interchangeably solely for that aspect in popular culture.  Fascism also includes an economic component, one where the government exerts control over privately help businesses through partial ownership.  This is not the simple complete ownership of industry in Communism, but has the result of government direction of industry in many cases.  Again, this could not have evolved without the concepts of State, corporations, human rights, etc, which have only developed in the last few hundred years.Racism is actually not the idea that a ""tribal group or nation"" is superior to others.  Racism is distinctly about race.  Europeans, for example, are usually of the same race but have been thinking that their tribe was superior to other European tribes for centuries.  Only since the human ability to circumnavigate the globe and come into contact with distinct races of people has the concept of   racism   evolved to where it is today.  The idea that one tribe is superior to another BECAUSE of the race could not have evolved when individuals never ran into individuals of separate races on a regular basis.Again, you point out some of the moral progress we have made along with our material progress, but as I have shown, a lot of moral ideas have come along that are NOT progress.  This Marxian idea of ""Progress,"" which so many individuals exhibit an almost religious faith in, is dangerous for humanity.  Thinking that every moral idea must be superior to the last, thinking that we inevitably will end up on Earth in a ""better place,"" is a dangerous way to think.  Not every idea, not every charismatic leader, leads us to a ""better place.""  The consequences of these ideas in the long run cannot always be known, but a simple exercise in thinking beyond emotions and the immediate consequences can usually lead us to more sound understanding."
1,"I'm not sure if you're aware, Benjamin Tuttle, but the last 3000+ years of human history have been anything but wise. They were marked by extreme anti-intellectualism, oppression, slavery, lack of women's rights, persecution of   science  , and worse. Should we just do whatever's been done in history and assume that because it's been done the last 3000+ years, it's correct? Perhaps you'd be the first to slice your arm open and bleed it out, as that was one of the ""wise"" cures of our forefathers.Sorry, I've never seen such a ridiculous argument."
1,"What is the difference between a gay married couple and a family where one parent got hit by a bus?The nuclear family is a myth these days. A mom, father and 1-3 kids just does not happen anymore. As the saying goes it takes a village to raise a child and even if the child has 2 mommies or two daddies it should not matter because they will still have their opposing gender's roles displayed to them by teachers, other relatives, and even friends parents.The thing is same-sex couples want LEGAL marriage and the rights, protections and obligations associated with it such as immigration rights which married couples have but the current established 'civil unions' for homosexuals do not. Is there something magical about having pieces that dont fit together that should deny them the same rights that heterosexual couples enjoy?I'll take this time to quote the 1st Amendment.Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.CONGRESS shall make no LAW respecting the ESTABLISHMENT of RELIGION. If you want to pawn Marriage off as a religious thing then you had best be prepared to deal with alternative religions that permit same sex couples. If it is not then it becomes a civil rights issue as congress has made laws (tax laws) that respect the establishment of religion (Judeo-Christian ideal of marriage). In either case the result would be the same if one followed the logic of arguing from the Original Position (look it up on Wikipedia)"
1,"The Alliance Defense Fund maintains that children without the “traditional” heterosexual parents will ultimately be a harmful influence on these children.  Even though they proclaim all sorts of unbiased evidence exists to support their claim, they make no mention of it and, in this debate, it has become really important to make your “non-partisan research” known, and better yet, to quote it, so that your assertions are clear and verifiable.  Lambda Legal, in their objection, quotes their own sources, and provides links to them, and these sources are of an authoritative nature.  Now, to ADF’s credit, the ADF does paraphrase a source with a name in their response to the objection, but we still have no idea what part of the text they refer to in these sources or how we might even find these sources.  The point is, unnamed sources might as well not exist, and unquoted sources, without any citation or means enabling verification, could very well misinterpret ideas or take them out of context.For the sake of argument, let’s disregard the alleged science of anyone’s claims and use some good ‘ole “common sense” ADF implores.  Now, psychologists might say that a child develops this way because a mother provides influence A and the father provides influence B, and perhaps we can quantify all such influences on child development, and then perhaps we could construct an ideal situation to raise children in.  But who knows what all the influences and factors and combinations there are, let alone how any treatment or situation might work out?  Is it better to spank or not to spank?  Daycare or no daycare?  Homeschool or no homeschool?  Perhaps there is an answer to every one of these kinds of questions, but you don’t need me to tell you we have all the answers, and that, if we have sufficient answers, we’re ready to believe them.  That’s why the government still gives parents a lot of free reign over their children.  We step in for a few things, like “food, clothing, health care, and education,” and housing, and a caring family environment, because the majority of people think that’s what children need, at a minimum, to live.  For children to thrive, that’s another question, my friend, one that works in same-sex and heterosexual parents, and ballet lessons, and Sesame Street, and Pre-K education—we will work hard and study these things, and perhaps one day the list of things child protection agencies and adoption organizations check up on will increase, but for now, in a reality not of absolutes but of heated controversy and, paradoxically, blurred distinctions, in child-rearing methodology, we have to give every loving parent a child to raise as best they can.  And God knows that love is better than anything else we can give them."
1,"This article claims that children raised by two moms or two dads are more likely to engage in early sex, do drugs, drop out, etc. Can this be blamed on the fact that the child was raised without a mom AND a dad or on the fact that society is so intolerant that constant ostracizing has led the child down the wrong path?  I don't think these types of statistics can be exclusively attributed to being raised by a gay couple.  There are far too many other factors to be considered, therefore the basis of this argument is a fallacy.  It is true that children raised by gay couples are more likely to be picked on but it is through society's own bigotry that this happens.  The most important factor in raising children is giving love and care, regardless of whether there is a mom AND a dad. "
1,"The fact that   kids   are better off with both a   mom   and a dad is questionable, simply because it is a correlation. Sure, kids are better off with two parents. They can appeal to a different parent if one is being unreasonable and there are more people to love them and look out for their well being. Single parents can't pay nearly as much attention to their   children   (I'm not saying that single parents don't still raise fine children) because they have to be the sole bread winner, and depending on which parent was killed, they might not have all of the   college     education   or job skills necessary to find as good as a job. Kids who are grieving are also more likely to be angry, withdrawn, and rebel. This is not any fault of the parent. Kids who are raised by   gay   parents do just as well being raised by two parents of the same gender. I honestly don't think that a child needs to be raised by two parents of the opposite sex. Two gay men might be hard pressed to raise a daughter, but they would do their best, and as long as they were loving and patient, there's no reason that the daughter wouldn't become a valuable member of   society  . All in all, a child just needs parents. Married couples also have a lot easier of a time   adopting  , and I would find it hard to believe that a child would honestly be better off in the foster care system than in a loving home being raised by two parents, regardless of gender.

2,"The ADF is not objecting to the fact that children so far in our limited research have done well with two parents.  In a situation where there is a loving same-sex couple willing to adopt a child that otherwise would have no family, that choice is obvious.The issue lies with Lambda Legal's refusal to acknowledge the ADF's point.  Allowing same-sex marriage makes a statement to society, whether you agree or not, that a male parent and a female parent is no longer ideal.  It deprives a child of the inherent right to have a mother and a father as an ideal family.  Once a society removes that distinction, it can no longer say that a child should have a mother and father if possible instead of a same-sex set of parents.At heart is the fact that this denies the scientifically documented (as if we needed it) differences between men and women.  Removing that ideal of both sexes from a child's upbringing deprives them of exposure to both sexes and denies that that makes any difference."
1,"Marriage, in and of itself, has nothing to do with children. Marriage is just the act of two consenting adults pledging to become their own family together. Whether or not they have children is strictly up to each individual marriage. Therefore, it can't be said that giving marriage rights to gay/lesbian couples deprives a child of the inherent right to a mother and father.There are things that do help in that arena though: egg donors, sperm banks, deadly accidents, divorce."
2,"Marriage, in and of itself, was created for multiple reasons, but one of the main ones is because it provides the most stable environment to raise children in.  Denying this goes against 4000 years or more of human wisdom and history, although it is vogue to deny it.Allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry will inherently force society to accept that relationship as the same as a traditional marriage, and therefore force upon adoption agencies and sperm banks, etc, giving such relationships equal weight to traditional couples.  It is this ""sameness"" that is unacceptable and irresponsible, because it forces on society the unscientific and wrong idea (though politically correct) that two moms or two dads is just as good as a mom and a dad.Yes, in the real world, situations are different.  I'd much rather a same sex couple care for a child than a single parent, or a single parent instead of no parent.  Obviously, this is not an either/or.  In the end, though, same-sex marriage being elevated to being the same as traditional marriage denies the differences between men and women and furthermore removes the ability for society to prefer a traditional couple as the best way to raise a child which it is. I realize you probably will never agree, but I encourage you to at least acknowledge and attempt to understand the premises which I am laying out."
1,"Do you have any research to back up the statement that the main reason for marriage was to provide a stable environment to raise children? I'm no expert, but I always thought the main reasons for marriage has been to pass on bloodlines and property rights. I don't think ancient man was as concerned with the proper ""environment"" to raise children so much as they were concerned about being able to lay claim to a son/daughter. Sperm/Egg banks and adoption agencies are all private entities. They aren't forced into anything and they already cater to gay/lesbian couples. Some of these couples even manage to have heterosexual relationships long enough to produce children of their own. Allowing gay/lesbians to marry won't change the fact that they are already capable of having children one way or another. I am a fan of a two-parent household. I especially like for the parents to be married. I, like you, think it's ideal. I understand your concern for children needing a father and a mother, because I completely agree. But I also think that children deserve, more than anything, a loving environment where they can prosper and be safe. If that comes in a gay/lesbian household so be it.What exactly do you mean by ""elevating same sex marriages denies the differences between men and women""? How so? It's a fact that men and women are different. I have no problem with that thought. In a same sex relationship, there isn't one partner ""playing"" the opposite sex. They embrace the fact that they are either two women or two men together. What do you envision will happen if homosexual couples are allowed to marry? What is the outcome for children, in your estimation? Are straight couples going to be denied the ability to adopt or have fertility treatments? "
2,"Since children for the last few thousand years have been a key aspect of carrying on the bloodlines, holding onto the property in the family, and providing much needed extra hands and income, its fairly logical.  I'm rather surprised that you even challenge the assertion that children are a main reason for traditional marriage throughout history, I'd be glad to look up some research at a later date.Adoption agencies, for example, and sperm/egg banks are private agencies, but that doesn't mean they are not regulated.  Massachusetts is a famous example of a Catholic adoption agency that, because of the same-sex ruling by the judges by fiat over the will of the people there, cannot prefer a traditional married couple to a same-sex one.  While I disagree with the agency for shutting down at that point, I am strongly opposed to the government forcing that upon a religion, which is happening and will continue to happen as the government forces same-sex marriage on society.  If it were a laissez-faire, that'd be one thing, but the government recognizing it overrules religious beliefs (so much for separation of church and state) and forces everyone to abide by its rulings.Same-sex marriage being exactly the same in status in society forces society to accept the falsity that men and women are the same.  If two moms or dads is just as good (because, remember, we can no longer prefer a traditional couple to a same-sex one or refuse based on our beliefs to give eggs, etc, from a bank) as a mom and a dad for children, then having two dads MUST give children all of the same benefits of a mom and a dad.  It doesn't, because men and women are different.Thanks for the discussion."
1,"I'm typing on my phone so I'll only adress one issue: Massachusetts and the   catholic     adoption   issue.The ability of the court to overturn the so called ""will of the people"" is necessary for the protection of the minority from the ""tyranny of the majority."" To even demean the courts for overruling laws ""against the will of the people"" is truly representative of a   conservative  's desire to have pure democacy... Which is how communism AND fascism come into   power  (all you need to do is convince the majority that you are right and it won't matter what the minority says). Please don't insult our legal system just because you disagree with the outcome of a particular case. As for why the catholic adoption agencies being forced to accept   gay   couples is because of the 14th ammendment(equal protection) to our   constitution  . The   children   in orphanages can't choose to transfer to ""pro-gay"" adoption agency and are therefore denied rights that are granted to other orphans. It's really very simple: it's about protecting children from illegal   discrimination   and giving the children equal access to adoptive   parents  ! "
2,"The relevant text of the 14th amendment is:No State shall make or enforce any   law   which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.I of course am not insulting our   legal   system, other than the fact you are completely ignoring the complex legal question surrounding the clash of the 1st amendment with your interpretation of the 14th.  The 1st Amendment:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of   religion  , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.I, as many other individuals far more intelligent than I, are arguing that   same-sex marriage   is NOT a 14th amendment issue.  They are NOT being denied any rights regarding marriage... they have the same right to marry someone of the opposite sex as everyone else.  The issue is whether they WANT to marry someone of the opposite sex.  The issue is ultimately about homosexuals' completely legitimate desire to feel accepted by   society  .  Tolerance and love should be shown to all individuals, but that does not mean we make rash decisions that affect generations of society because of our supposed compassion for their situation (and arrogance that we know far better than every generation before us).Given the Catholic Adoption agency, they have a Constitutional RIGHT to practice their religion.  The government cannot ask them to prohibit the free expression of their beliefs, in this case their beliefs against same-sex marriage, EVEN IF it gives them   money  .  If the government gives you a welfare check, can they prohibit your   free speech  ?"
1,"""...it can no longer say that a child should have a mother and father if possible instead of a same-sex set of parents.""Everyone believes that a child should have a mother and father, if possible, but we certainly don't take the children away from single mothers and give them to two-parent families. An ideal for an imaginary child has nothing to do with people's daily lives. A child with involved grandparents may do what any single mom's child does and turn to the grandparent for a role model of that gender, or bond closely with an uncle or aunt. And since many lesbian couples have children from one partner's previous relationship, and they will be a couple regardless if they're married or not, you seem to be hinting that it would be best to take the child from the lesbian regardless of how custody was arranged--or the reasons for her having custody--and giving it to the ex-husband if he only gets a girlfriend.  "
2,"Yes, reality is much tougher than idealism.  That is the precise reason I take my position on many issues.I obviously would prefer a same-sex couple taking care of a child to a single parent or no parent.  I want what is best for each child.  The issue I have, though, is that elevating same-sex marriage to be the same as traditional marriage further denies the inherent differences between the sexes (the denial of which has already damaged society) and denies the ability of society to say that, wherever possible, a traditional married couple is preferred over all other options because of its proven superiority as a method of raising children.  Denying that denies 4000 years+ of human experience and basic science.  Acknowledging it accepts reality and places an ideal for a flawed society to strive towards."
1,"While females are paid 75 cents to every dollar a man earns, I can't agree with your idea that the sexes are similar enough.I'm also not sure which inherent differences you're referring to, or which damage. Please understand, however, that I just a few days ago read a Victorian-era screed that decried young women of good families going to work as governesses. The author's reasoning was because their taking jobs unseated social order, caused breakdown in the class system, and caused woes to women that in turn drove them to feminism and caused men to disrespect the gentler sex. And while science does agree there are some innate differences between men and women, this is a description, not a prescription. "
2,"Gay marriage should be compared against average marriages; not worst case ones. All of the arguments negating this question are compared against the dysfunctions occurring in worst case marriages.
"
2,"Thanks for the discussion.There are a host of inherent differences, many of which we are only able to specify now with advanced genetic and biological techniques.  Some many blame some of them on society, such as the fact that there just aren't as many women in the hard sciences and engineering as men, even though women make up 55% of the college population.  The differences in how men and women look at the world and evolutionarily have developed is massive, and denying those differences to a child when there is another option is wrong.  While the real world sometimes makes a same-sex couple the best option, removing the ability of society to prefer that optimal partnership for raising children over alternatives is the travesty.The framing of this argument is very important.  One side claims it is one of the last big hurdles to achieving equal rights for homosexuals.  I feel compassion for them and that is a very difficult decision.  The other side, though, doesn't get their frame heard in the media.  I am not against same-sex marriage, per se, but FOR traditional marriage and holding it up as the optimal situation in society.  If society can no longer prefer traditional marriage over any other form, be it same-sex marriage or polygamy, etc, society can no longer prefer the optimal situation for raising children.I appreciate the discussion.John Haidt, a Social Psychology PHD, has a great lecture on TED about the moral differences between Left and Right.  It may help to shed some light on the place that half of Americans come from.  In the end, it is all a framing issue, and having both frames understood is extremely important.   http://www.ted.com/index.php   /talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html"
1,"I think you might be missing a logical factor of your argument. You've pointed out there's a 50/50 representation in college. I've taken biology, anatomy and physiology, and a major's worth of psychology classes, and done as well as the males. Science classes are a prerequisite, and women and men are passing them equally. So, since they show the same aptitude for the same subjects on the lower levels, something must be stepping in to select for a career in the sciences.I read an account by a female scientist with two email accounts, one with her initials, one with her name. Colleagues assumed the account with the initials was male and kept that account in the loop with news and rumors; they ignored the one with her first name on it. It wasn't that they didn't like or know her; they didn't like or know the other account either. That's one example of how your career as a scientist is defined by passive discrimination in a publish-or-perish field where your colleagues are all-important. I'm sure how you can see a similar effect might chip in at the grad student level. So if I had a college-age daughter, I would tell her that she could succeed just like the men, but she could expect people telling her that she couldn't do it and trying to undercut her.I also have to argue with your use of ""traditional"" marriage. I know I bring up the Victorians a lot, but go read ""Oliver Twist."" Maybe just the first few chapters. Adults starved and jailed and beat tiny children in the Victorian era and thought nothing of it; children weren't the purpose of marriage, as people claim now. Marriage was all about social and economic stability. Children were just a side result and you only needed one male to survive to be your heir and social bargaining chip. (It's in the Bible; children are not treasure, but a ""quiver full"" of arrows.) Today's view of children as all-important is a modern luxury, not a traditional function.In my view, Western marriage evolved from ""one man with as many wives as he could afford"" to ""one man with one wife whose property he owned"" to ""one man and woman who could keep her property"" to ""one man and one woman who could divorce him and still keep custody."" Marriages also shifted from arranged to love matches. And homosexual marriage was around for the British and French in the early Middle Ages, the Picts, and the Romans until it was banned as a political move. Given the  bigger picture, I see no reason not to bring it back today.Oh, I'm loving this discussion too. You're the opposite of me, and usually such people don't have your calm, for some odd reason. :D"
2,"I do enjoy the discussion's civility, which is why I will keep going at least one more.The representation in college overall is actually more like 55/45 female/male in college, and will be even stronger soon.  That representation does not translate to some hard sciences and engineering, yet, though.  Yes, indeed, science classes are passing males and females equally, but the issue is INTEREST in subjects, not ability.  Men and women can both be amazing at the sciences, Marie Curie comes immediately to mind, but again, the issue is the sex's interest.  Men are wired differently in their heads than females as has been scientifically proven.  The propensity for certain worldviews and abilities is greater in men for some things and greater for women for some things.  I am sure there are still incidences of sexism in the workplace and academics, and that is sad.  It is not the only reason for the massive disparity in the hard sciences though.You do bring up the Victorians a lot, and sadly there was child abuse.  There still is and probably always will be in our flawed world.  We have to remember, though, that ancient Egyptians and even tribes way farther back were virtually the same as we are now in ABILITY, but their knowledge was less.  Evolutionarily, we have not evolved much in abilities relatively because of the tiny scope of time we have had civilization.  Considering that, despite the anecdotes from the Victorian Age, children were the purpose of marriage because they supported the family as the family grew older and supported parents unable to do hard labor anymore on the farms, etc.  Truly today they are a luxury and a focus unseen in human history, but that does not remove the purpose of marriage as a means to produce children throughout history.  There is a reason 4000+ years of humanity has chosen man/woman marriage as the optimum situation, despite its difficulties.Of course there were specific instances you can point out that there were changes, but arguing the exception is the rule is silly.  I realize that for many this is an extremely emotional issue (because the reasoning to give same-sex marriage rights is purely compassionate), so I commend your ability to be so clear.  I appreciate that, because I can't seem to find many that can discuss it clearly.  My only hope is to at least drive home the frame I have chosen to see the issue through so you understand why half of America (or more) opposes same-sex marriage.  Its not for bigoted or hateful reasons (that's the easy way out instead of having these discussions).  Its because they want traditional marriage to be held up as the model for the family because it is the optimal situation to raise a child.  Once society chooses no longer to value specific life choices over others, we descend into chaos.Thanks."
1,"So, beyond queenraven's obvious point that marriage has nothing to do with children, you honestly think that only ideal parents should be allowed to marry?That almost makes ME want to use the slippery slope fallacy!"
1,"""The fact is that there is no non-partisan social science research supporting the notion that all children need is two parents, regardless of sex.   None.

1,"Ahhhh, to ""protect"" the   children   from the horrible life of same sex ""PARENTS"" and families, I know thats not what was said, but rather inferred. Children ALWAYS do best when they have the influence of both male and female HEALTHY role models, when they feel safe and secure, valued and loved, when their family isn't being put up to (mostly) Christian flogging of going to hell, being called perverts, pediophiles and watching the tv ads that show other people they don't know trying to ""protect"" them from that person who reads to them at night. ALL of my same sex FEMALE friends who have children also have the healthy male role models in their childs life, to balance what they cannot be, lets get real. HOWEVER just because 2 women will never be anything other than, DOES NOT mean the child will suffer. Marriage, 50% divorce rate, so if a child is all happy and carefree, getting the BEST of mom and dad, oh wait how good could it have been if the child was/is living in an enviornment where mommy and daddy are beginning the steps towards divorce, the child has to live with it while it's happening, watch it, hear it and feel it. Face it it doesn't happen over night so how long has the child been exposed? And divorce...50% is an extremely high rate so how does that show mommy and daddy have something special called marriage? Lets see...and then there's the same sex parents who actually give birth or adopt. No ""whoops"" there, it's planned out, saved for and wanted. That child is sooo loved before they even arrive, and if indeed they adopted, who's child was it? Probably some lesbian out there trying to sabotage numbers of hetrosexual throw away babies that come from that precious gift of reproduction that's taken for granted and has no real value, just like the life that was created in a careless moment and given away, (but thank you for not aborting!).Children...and on this note, WHY are yours so much better than mine? WHY does my child HAVE to sit in PUBLIC school and be taught about your family and never see their family reflected in the teachings? WHY are you dictating to our children their lessons? Oh thats right...YOU have all the rights, yours are the only ones that count, what would happen if indeed YOUR child was teased, bullied and taunted every day and then committed suicide? Ohhhh, heads would role, but hey when its the child of a same sex couple or just a young person who discovers they are gay, it's ok? So children, I think same sex couples and families do a better job as they teach their children respect for ALL, compassion, empathy(we've been there) and to not judge or discriminate, most I know are faith based, just not fanatical based or the corporate organized   religion   type. Children are children, leave them out of this ADULT battle, you take care of yours and we'll take care of ours. We talk about the day at school, lessons learned and we discuss OUR family values in relation to, what do YOU do? The school is not where we turn to for our childrens life lessons and beliefs, your child won't poison mine with your values or beliefs, actually it's more info for my child to make INFORMED choices as they grow with guidance from us.

Put up or shut up. The way I see it, Lambda cited direct quotes and linked to more than one national organization that supports their position and provides evidence.

1,"I don't disagree with your argument that All things being equal the children are better off with a loving mom and dad.  But all things are never equal.  Many children do not grow up with a LOVING mom and dad, even when the family starts with a mom and dad.  Often children are born out of wed-lock and only have a mom, or the dad leaves, dies, is jailed, etc., etc.  What about these situations?So if two people of the same sex are in love and want to start a family who are you to say that they will not make good, loving parents?

1,"What gay people seek is equality. If a heterosexual relationship can be formalised by the state in marriage and thereby attract certain privileges, then the same should be true of homosexual relationships.  If not, then inequality exists.  The attempt to tie in procreation as being essential to marriage is a contrivance used by those who simply don't want gay people to be able to marry each other.In any case, your arrival at the assumption that gay marriage will somehow damage other people's children by making their straight parents less likely to marry, seems bizarre.  It is essentially just the opinion of David Blankenhorn, who as founder and president of the Institute for American Values, is hardly an independent voice on this issue.  The fact is that marriage was on the wane for many years before the relatively recent phenomenon of gay marriage.  The idea that a straight couple would decline marriage simply because gays can also marry, seems highly implausible."

1,"The idea that kids will be hit hardest if gays and lesbians are allowed to marry is a myth. The biggest threat to children today is the high divorce rate among hetrosexuals, many of whom are professing Christians. Instead of worrying about whether gays and lesbians will stay together, the hetrosexual critics should clean up their own act first. The fact is there are many gays and lesbians who have lived in faithful monogamous relationships for many years, raised children and done a commendable job. I live in Canada where gay marriage is legal and you know what, the country hasn't fallen apart. In fact, things have never been better."
2,"I disagree with all points you present.  Kids are hit from all sides, and at the top of the list, is the parents (mom and dad) or guardians (lesbians and gay/couples).  Kids cannot escape either.Kids are hit when they see other parents that consist of male and a female.  Kids at school, once they know the child has same sex parents, will tease and belittle them.Kids in most situations do not have someone they can go for comfort and understanding.  Most humans do not have the capacity to express themselves well enough to help themselves, let alone help others, and this has been with us since the beginning of man kind.Kids have enough problems growing without increasing their burden by forcing them into a situation that isn't normal.  The kids end up suffering, and like most family settings, when done wrong,   society   also pays.Have we had a chance to actually see these   children   in homsexual settings?  No!  The few that we have seen, the kids think their guardians are weird, or just have no respect for them.  This are the kids that were not affected by this strange desire to be together."
1,"If   children   look down on others who are different from them who do you think is to blame? The parents and other adults in our   society  , that's who. I read recently a gospel tract put out by a very well known right wing Christian. It showed a girl in elementary school who was opposed to her teacher allowing two gay dentista to come to the school and speak to their class. She was telling her classmates that her grandfather told her that being gay was a sickness and sin and she was   simply assuming that it was the correct thing to say. I once overheard a mother telling her little girl whose name was Suzy some very important things. She said, ""Suzy, you will probably encounter people in this world who look down on other people because they are different than them. Suzy, even if they talk like that, you must not look down on people just because they are different than you. Everybody has a place in this world and you must show respect for them. If you want to get respect, you must show respect."" I think it's time for all of us adults to start acting like Suzy's mother instead of that other girl's grandfather. If we do, we will go a long way to changing things for the better."
2,"I agree that kids are hit the hardest.  Some may not be impacted, others may not understand what they see and end up with mental instability themselves, and even others will get the idea that this was meant for them.  Like playing God with the thoughts of people, for we have seen people can be swayed, manipulated, brain-washed to think something wrong is right.Recently on the Dr. Phil show, a husband decides he wants to be a woman.  The daughters are devistated.  now they will have to spend countless years trying to understand something that they may never learn to understand, and now, they will fear the males they meet if they will do the same thing to them that their father did to them.  We can be reckless and totally destroy the fabric of humans, create people who do not think before they act, and the next thing you know, these group will have high levels of suicide,   drug use  , and diseases only because we think we have a right to mate with our own gender.  Will it stop here, or will humans decide they can marry objects and   animals  ?Kids should not be in the picture."

This argument that   children   are hit the hardest, and then going on about single   parenting   in the same opinion are both counter-productive and counter-intuitive.  It is precisely the desires of those wishing for marriage that define a two person household.  A homosexual couple is two people.  A divorced man and woman creates the single parent household.  Your argument may as well state that divorce should be illegal.  Perhaps you feel that way, and that is an entirely different debate.This social argument that gay marriage destroys conventional marriage is a boogeyman, fallacy ridden arguement and I am quite tired of hearing it.

1,"I and many others I have met and spoken with over the years can attest to the fallacy of the ""normal family"". My father was an abusive bully and my   mother   a depressive alcoholic needless to say mine was not a happy childhood. But they were ""normal"". I have known many others who were sexually and physically abused by their ""normal"" parents and had I had a child early (before I learned how to deal with my own problems) I probably would have been abusive. Just being Heterosexual doesn't automatically make you a good parent or person. I think if all couples had to go through the same screening process that gay couples go through the world would be a better place but try getting that approved.   "
2,"Two people of the same sex getting married is just two people playing house. It has nothing to do with hate or discrimination. It has to do with what is right or wrong. Allowing gay marriage is just showing that the society is going deeper into moral decay. God is the one that created marriage & it is between one man and one woman anything else apart from that is not of God therefore, cannot be called a marriage.Some people might say God does not judge them well let's clarify that. While you are alive on this earth in your mortal body God has not yet pass judgment on anyone because he wants everyone to be saved and that means accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior of your life, because after death is the judgment. Everyone will give have to an account on the type of life they lived here on earth.Does God allow each of us to make our own choices? Yes, but know this every decision you make has consequences. The Bible said in Revelation 2l verse 8, ""But the cowardly, the unbelieving the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars-their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."" I am not making this up it is already written."
1,"But maybe someone else did. I recognize your right to believe in any god you choose, but I do ask that you also recognize others' rights to believe (or not) as they wish, and that therefore turning religion into law goes against a basic human right to choose not to believe in a religion.  If your intent is to convince others that same-sex marriage is wrong, you will do better if you rely on logic rather than faith."
1," Children do not need distinct male and female parental role-models What children need first is love, compassion, and care from their parents. In addition, children are highly influenced by their social environment as much as their parents, making it unreasonable to place such a high importance on the attributes that parents display.

1,"Have you ever lied, Tamara?"
1,"I object to the assumption that the purpose of marriage is for procreaion.  Were this the case we would prohibit couples where either the man or the woman were sterile, couples who had progressed past the child-bearing age, or couples who did not intend to have children with the same legal strictures that we place on gay couples.Accepting same-sex couples marrying is not the same as relatives marrying, nor is it the same as multiple marriage, or ""marriage"" to an animal.  Each of these are very seperate and distinct arguements.The legal basis for marriage exists to ensure the rights that the states and federal government provide such as visitation in hospitals, tax incentives, etc.  Should there be an objection on a religious basis this is for each church, synagogue, mosque, etc to determine on their own what they choose to do, from their own religious standpoint.  The seperation clause should keep that decision out of a legal framework."
1,"In advocating same-sex marriage, we acknowledge that any two people who love each other should be able to marry each other, and children, in a safe and loving environment, will be raised well by any parents.  We do, of course, have to lay certain restrictions on love and marriage, for the sake of the exploited and the offspring (in the case of incest).  Children cannot marry each other, for they are not mature enough to consent to a commitment and to sexual relations.  An adult cannot marry a child, for the child still cannot consent.  Nor can bestiality be tolerated—it is abusive to the animal—or (generally speaking) incest, since the offspring of that relationship would be unfairly subjected to the genetic disturbances consequent of inbreeding.  The great irony of the Alliance Defense Fund’s argument is that they expose the bias of those who might advocate same sex marriage with one hand, and decry other sound marriages with the other.Those marriages between consenting adults must be tolerated, unless it is an incestuous relationship that may produce children.  We do not have to be comfortable with it—if we cannot deny it based on logic, then government and society must be tolerant of others beliefs.  I am a practicing Catholic, and I wholeheartedly side with my church on issues of incest and polygamy, but I cannot ask my government to make laws against them, for my beliefs in their immorality are founded in religious dogma, not secular reason, and as such, it would be unjust, and un-Christian, of me to force my religious dogma upon other people."
1," What about a brother and sister “in love?”  The typical objection when confronted with the brother-sister “marriage” challenge is that procreation between siblings increases the chance for birth defects in children.  So then, what is the objection to two brothers “marrying?” Several other reasons that sibling-sibling (and, for that matter, parent-child) marriages are unadvisable are here elided, including perhaps most important—the likelihood of coercion. Indeed, considering that married couples who are known to have a high probability of producing children with very severe congenital conditions are permitted to procreate, it strikes me as being significantly less important than the question of informed consent. The opposition cannot object to a brother-brother “marriage” absent an appeal to a moral standard. There seems to be an unstated assumption that those on the side of marriage equality reject the idea that marriage should be subject to moral constraints, but very few actually do. The argument in favour of marriage equality is that the current moral standard which excludes same-sex couples is  inappropriate , not that there should be no moral restrictions whatever. But in objecting to all sibling “marriages” they are unwittingly arguing that marriage:  1) is essentially a procreative institution, 2) benefits the state primarily as a child-protective institution, and 3) may be limited by moral considerations.  These are the very arguments they must reject in order to justify the imposition of same-sex “marriage.” It is unclear why the first two premises are important to the scenario presented above, and the last premise misrepresents the arguments underlying marriage equality.  See above. Sibling-sibling marriages are legitimately rejected on a basis other than procreation.  Children are not a prerequisite to being recognised as married, nor are same-sex parents unheard of. Additionally, there are other statutory benefits to stabler, happier, more affluent families.  See above. Arguing against one particular, extant restriction does not constitute a challenge to them all; this is as true in the case of marriage equality for same-sex couples as it was for that of marriage equality for interracial couples.   But the opposition refuses to engage in a thoughtful debate on these issues. Perhaps there are some individuals who do not wish to investigate this issue with composure and honesty, but it is unfair to characterise all by the actions of a few."

1,"That's precisely what you're doing.  How is it just to deny same-sex marriages on the unfounded argument that ""it might open the door to other kinds of marriages""?  That's like saying that, since allowing people to ingest green ketchup, people will begin to ingest everything green and slimy including pickles and toxins; therefore, green ketchup should not be eaten.  Or like saying that, since it's okay to put your child in time-out for one minute, it will be okay to put them in time-out for two minutes, or three, or all eternity; therefore, time-outs should be prohibited.  Or perhaps since it's okay to slip in one red herring, we'll slip in a second and a third and pretty soon the discussion of same-sex marriages will become one of metaphysics and philosophy, neither of which have a standing in law; therefore, we should abandon discussion of same-sex marriages altogether.I don't think I need to slap you in the face and tell you to focus on what's actually going on here.  The question is whether same-sex couples -should- be allowed to marry.  That question can be answered by asking the question: In today's society, what does marriage signify?"
1,"Arguing that   same-sex marriage   is a slippery slope completely ignores the fact that   society   and courts are able to distinguish between different situations.  Courts, state, and the federal government will easily be able to recognize   gay marriage   while still banning marriage between blood relatives.Assuming that once gay marriage is allowed that all types of marriage must follow also ignores that standards can be developed and lines can be drawn.When marriage between interracial couples was finally recognized, did that former slippery slope lead to polygamy?  When women were finally granted the right to   vote  , did that lead to infants being allowed the right to vote?It is important to not factor in ""slippery slopes"" with regard to fundamental rights.  Fundamental rights should be protected among all citizens, including the fundamental right to marry.  Recognizing a slippery slope when protecting a human right is illogical and ridiculous."
2,"When marriage between interracial couples was finally recognized, did that former slippery slope lead to homosexual marriage?"
1,The slippery slope argument comes in if you use a 14th Amendment argument but it isn't. It's a Full Faith and Credit argument. A   marriage   from one state HAS to be recognized in all the states. Once Iowa legalized   gay marriage   the argument against gay marriage became moot!
1,"I have been reading through the comments about   same-sex marriage  . I am in favour. Have always  been and view it as positive. God has nothing to do with civil   society   o else it would be a   theocracy  . I believe that a true civil society (i.e. France) would only recognize marriages performed by the state rather than by churches. Slippery slopes: well look at Las Vegas marriages. It's a silly argument b/c ultimately it has nothing to do with   gay marriage   - the issue is bigotry. If Jesus was one of us, I am sure he would fool most people. His message is of peace and   tolerance  . And sadly no one is listening. I aplaud any laws that speak out for tolerance. BTW i have no issue with polygamy between consenting adults. Who cares. Abraham did it right!!! Goodness people just let your neighbours be happy, life is short. "
1," The quality of parenting should not be a factor in legalizing gay marriage, as it is not a legal factor in ordinary marriages  Many characteristics of individuals would lead one to believe that there is a high probability that they will be bad parents, but this cannot cause the state to ban these individuals from becoming married parents. Neither should it for gay couples.
"
2,"It's sad when comments like this come to light. These types of comments show ignorance about how western   society   came to be and who Jesus is. Western society was built upon the Judeo-Christian tradition. A simple look at the 10 Commandments should be a clear indication the basis of our own laws. There are some Greek and Roman philosophies thrown in, but the foundation of our system of justice is the 10 commandments. Our founding documents mention God and Creator, and many of the state constitutions mention God directly. A   theocracy   is a government run by   religious   leaders, usually of one denomination -- that's what the 1st Amendment prohibited. However, our country was founded by religious men who trusted in God and the Bible to guide their daily lives. And regarding the   tolerance   of Jesus, you obviously have no clue. Yes, Jesus Christ represents love in its purest form, in that He sacrificed Himself for mankind to pay for   sin  . But regarding marriage, God created Adam and Eve, therefore defining the institution of marriage as between a man and a woman. Same-sex ""marriage"" pokes God in the eye and warps His definition of marriage. Do you really think Jesus Christ will tolerate people thumbing their noses at God's institution?"
1,"Going by your logic, slavery should be legal. After all, the founding fathers demonstrably had or condoned having slaves (as evident in the Dred Scott v. Sandford reasoning).Shall we bring on the slaves, then?"
1,"For background's sake. I was raised a Christian and my credentials are excellent. I am very well versed on the 10 commandments, old and new testament, as well as most things Christian. My family has many members who have devoted their lives to serve their   religion   and are placed very highly in the Church. Now that this is established, please be careful when you attack people for their ignorance. What comes out when you attack like this is that it reveals your ignorance and anger. Clarity of mind only comes when calm. I wanted to comment that although our Western   society   has based its legal system on the Judeo-Christian faiths, it does not mean that it was right or that it should be so or be imposed on citizens. We live in a world of many belief systems and we cannot choose one   faith   over another. The best choice for civil society is to choose laws based on   tolerance   and respect. Individuals can choose their gods and live by their belief systems at home. No one will impede on those rights. At least it gives an equal chance for everyone to live free from fear.As for God being written into our constitutions and courts of law. I believe it is a grave error. It is a North American and not a European tradition. The French revolution got rid of God in its civil society to create a clear separation of church and state. The state doe snot have any allegiances other than to its citizens. So to put the debate back to same sex marriages, if one desires to be married to a partner of same sex than by all means please do. You don't have too. That is true freedom. God will one judge you. You are not God so please do not judge others. You are not responsible for the   soul   of others. "
2,"It's a shame that you have such a strong Christian background and yet have fallen for the New Age philosophy. It appears you have rejected Biblical principles in favor of the politically correct philosophy of today's world. All societies ""impose"" on their citizens their particular belief systems. I disagree that God being written into our founding documents is a North American tradition. Western   society   (Europe, North and South America) is what it is today because of Christianity; the practice of Christianity throughout western history has been somewhat dubious, but the principles are what established western society. The abuse of Christianity was only one cause of the French Revolution. The main causes were famine, high   taxes  , and   debt  . The French Revolution may have eliminated Christianity in its government, and look at how irrelevant France is today. Regarding true freedom -- freedom is not free and true freedom comes with responsibility. You are confusing freedom with licentiousness. Freedom doesn't mean doing what you want when you want. The American concept of freedom means that government should stay out of your way so you can determine your life. But government has established all sorts of limits on individual freedom, even those outlined in the Constitution, for the betterment of society as a whole. What insight have you gained that declares 10,000 years of human history wrong regarding   homosexual   marriage?As far as my judging others, Jesus Christ specifically said in John 7:24 -- ""Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment."" Since   homosexuality   goes against God's Word, I am judging homosexuality, not homosexuals. Opposing the act of homosexuality is righteous judgment. Someone well-versed in Scripture should know that. God has already judged me through the blood of Jesus Christ. One day I will have to stand before God and answer for my actions, but my   soul   has already been judged and redeemed. When I do stand before God, I'll have to answer for a lot of things, but at least I won't have to explain why I went against Him in the area of homosexuality. And while I'm not entirely responsible for souls, I am responsible for spreading the gospel message of hope. So I do have a part to play."
1,Responding once again that there's no such thing as Judeo-Christian. It's just Christian. Jews were not involved.
2,"Ah, the slavery strawman ... what a waste of an argument. First of all, slavery has nothing to do with this issue. Homosexuality is a lifestyle choice, not innate and not a civil right. There is an overwhelming amount of research and studies that prove   homosexuality   is not inborn. There are few studies that may indicate otherwise, but one has to look hard and with a strong bias to find such indications. People cannot change the color of their skin; homosexuals can change their behavior. My father is the perfect example. He said he was never truly happy in that lifestyle, not because of the negative attitudes toward homosexuality, but because homosexuality was his attempt to satisfy himself sexually. He came to realize the lifestyle is self-destructive and left it. His only regret was that he didn't leave that lifestyle sooner."
1,"""Homosexuality is a lifestyle choice, not innate and not a civil right.""If anything, this is the red herring. The point I bring up when I invoke Dred Scott v. Sandford is that Justice Traney and the Justices that followed him used flat-out originalist thinking when forming their opinion. They -didn't care about justice- at all. They cared about what the founding fathers (allegedly) thought about, and nothing else. All I said was that originalist viewpoints cannot stand on their own.Homosexuality being a choice is irrelevant to discussion.Personal appeals are irrelevant to law.Are you about to tell me not only (1) that your experience is more valuable than someone else's, and (2) that we should all follow your opinion? Perhaps I think being a   vegetarian   is more healthy than eating   meat  , yet I'm not about to pose the same standards upon you."
2,"I do agree with you regarding the Founding Fathers   treatment   of slavery and American Indians in the Constitution. Many of our Founding Fathers were opposed and relunctantly accepted its inclusion to keep the framework going. As abhorrent as slavery is, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutional duty in the Dred Scot decision -- the court interpreted the law at that time. It did not make new law, an unconstitutional action that the Burger Court assumed. When American   society   finally realized the evils of slavery, the Constitution was amended, as outlined by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution.Homosexualty being a choice is not irrelevant to this discussion. It actually goes to the heart of the matter. Civil rights were denied to African-Americans simply because of their skin color, something they could not change. Homosexuals are commandeering the African-American struggle for   civil rights   as their cause. Homosexuals are claiming that they're born   homosexual  , and thus cannot change. That's the red herring in this debate.My experience is no more valuable than anyone else's, but I use it to back up my side of the debate. Personal appeals enact more laws that you're giving credit for. That's why we have such laws as ""Meghan's Law"" and the current mortgage   bailout  . Our government didn't want to see people losing their homes, even though those people weren't responsible enough with their own   money   to buy homes they could afford. Whenever someone testifies before Congress in support of or in opposition to proposed legislation, they are making personal appeals in relating their positions.And when the government steps in and requires me to become a   vegetarian   like you, will you stand with me in opposition to that intrusion? "
1,"Again, I'm not equating African-American   civil rights   to   homosexual   civil rights. I'm just opposing originalist thinking.""And when the government steps in and requires me to become a   vegetarian   like you, will you stand with me in opposition to that intrusion?""I will. Because individuals should have the   right to choose   their lifestyles so long as it doesn't disrupt another person's life, liberty, property, or pursuit of happiness. Until it can logically and empirically be shown that non-  vegetarianism   directly harms another individual, and that that harm is great enough to warrant government intrusion, I would never find it fit for a government to coerce people into becoming   vegetarians  .Similarly, I would never find it fit for a government to coerce people into becoming heterosexual. THIS is the point I'm making."

1,"It's not really that gays should adopt, but it's just that I don't care.As long as the parents aren't messed up and the kid comes out of childhood OK, it's not my place to say whether they can or can't adopt.That's really the only thing that should matter to anyone."
2,"You should care. What if the kid thinks that everyone has two Daddies or two mommies. How are they going to adequately explain the ""birds and the bees?"""
1,"Why should I care? Explain one reason why I should care, as I said above, if the kid comes out okay, and is taken care of? People come out of single parent, and single-sex, relationships just fine. I say go ahead. I do not think I am so high and mighty that my own opinion justifies the rule of behavior for a whole section of society. I am just not that self-confident, I guess...But, I'm getting off subject. It's not my place to care. The ""birds and the bees"" get explained just fine to boys and girls that never had the opportunity to have mothers or fathers. And I think you know it, Bill."
1,I have actually never been given the ' birds and the bees ' speech from my mother or father. Even if a couple is homosexual they still know what the speech is I mean I have never heard it from my parents but I have heard it from other people and on TV. So what difference does it make that a couple wants a kid even if it is a couple of 2 males or 2 females. Studies have already proven that a child from a homosexual couple turns out the same as a child from a heterosexual couple.
2,If children should be amongst children that has a father(male) and mother(Female) the children is going to mock at them.They wont know how to act amongst children with normal parents.

2,What if the couple breaks up who'll get custody? How will they determine who is the better parent? How will the adoption agency approve the couple? Don't they say they should get married!!!!!!!!!

1,"Who gets custody if a straight couple breaks up? The better parent. Who would get custody is a gay couple breaks up? The better parent.How do they determine the better parent? The same way they would with a straight couple. There are no differences, because father's have been fighting for their rights to their children.And yes, parents should get married before they adopt. That's a great reason to let gays get married. Thank you, Tugman."
1," Children always benefit from having two parents opposed to just one, regardless of whether they are straight or not ""Single-parent mom"" is an all too frequent term. It is costly to children, primarily from the standpoint of having half the support that a child deserves. Married gay couples can provide twice the support that a single parent can provide, and this is always a good thing.

That they can never want to spend the rest of their lives together, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health? Why?

I am not the one stepping on people's liberty? I am not the one who is calling an entire group of humanity Would you marry a man? Then why should a lesbian be forced to marry a man? To claim that you are not denying people rights is as ludacris as the argument segregationists used to keep interracial marriage illegal: ""we're not violating their rights, because no one can marry outside of their gender, not just blacks.""I have a problem with the fact that your only reasons stem from a 2,000 year old book, and not from reason. Should we make shellfish illegal? The bible says we should. How about the part of the Bible that says, when a man sleeps with his daughter they both should be put to death. Allow me to repeat that for you: if a little girl is raped by her dad, she should be killed. By basing your ideas on religion, and not reason, you are essentially creating a theocracy. Are you familiar with the first amendment?Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religionA law based on religious reasons is an establishment of religion by definition. Your definition of family is equally bullshit. If I had a religion that said black people were evil, could I make laws that would discriminate against them? Well your own church thought so up until the 1970s.Until you give me an actual reason as to why gays should not adopt, you are still a fool for denying Americans rights. Your failure to recognize love in more then the narrow forms that your religion defines shows both narrow mindedness and bigotry. I can say this and know that in no way am I being arrogant, because if you were to ask me why I believe any action is either moral or immoral, I could give you reasons, and not mindlessly quote some book. Whether I am right or wrong is certainly debatable, but at least I can back up my beliefs."

Do not forget Jake that I go to church every week, so I know plenty about Christianity.As far as racism in the LDS church, how about we just look to Brigham Young?""Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African Race? If the White man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so.Cain slew his brother. . . and the Lord put a mark upon him, which is the flat nose and black skin.You see some classes of the human family that are black, uncouth, uncomely, disagreeable and low in their habits, wild, and seemingly deprived of nearly all the blessings of the intelligence that is generally bestowed upon mankind. The first man that committed the odious crime of killing one of his brethren will be cursed the longest of any one of the children of Adam. Cain slew his brother. Cain might have been killed, and that would have put a termination to that line of human beings. This was not to be, and the Lord put a mark upon him, which is the flat nose and black skin. Trace mankind down to after the flood, and then another curse is pronounced upon the same race--that they should be the 'servant of servants;' and they will be, until that curse is removed.""Mormons used this, and other racist statements made by leaders of the Church, as a reason to oppose interracial marriage.As for forcing people to marry, that is exactly what you said. You said that a homosexual could get married, just not to someone of the same sex. This means that if they want to marry the have to marry someone they don't want to. Now lets take the religion out of this, why should we change the definition of marriage for a select few?You want to take religion out of it? It's about time.Marriage is a social construct. That means it was created by people, and as such it is in our power to change it. We now know that not everyone is born heterosexual, but in fact many people are born homosexual. If marriage is defined as between only a man and a woman, these people are excluded from starting a family of their own. In addition, homosexuals make up more than ""a select few"" and therefore it affects millions of people in the U.S. At the same time, extending the definition of marriage to include homosexuals, would have absolutely no effect on the marriage of straight couples. In this sense marriage isn't being changed at all. Homosexuals should be allowed to marry because love knows no gender.Give me a reason why homosexuals should raise children. And I'm tired of hearing about that friend of yours, give me an actual reason. You are the one who wants change you should have to answer my question first.Actually, in most places it was not illegal for homosexual couples to adopt. Then people started making laws against it. These laws were declared unconstitutional, but people then passed amendments. In this sense you are wrong about me wanting the change, however, I will still back up my point.Homosexuals should be allowed to adopt because they have been shown to be equally capable parents through numerous studies source. Therefore, homosexual parents would be a great group of people to adopt orphans, and therefore there would be less foster children. In addition, people should have the right to raise a family. Since no harm is done by homosexual parenting, there is no reason to outlaw adoption by homosexuals.Jake you claim that you do not ""take everything from the bible literally and blindly""? and yet you still fail to give me reasons why homosexuality is wrong that are not religious. I can only interpret this to mean you have no reasons. Therefore you are forcing your religion on others. For someone who claims to be patriotic, this is the least American action I have heard in a long time.Edit:I forgot one more Bible quote. It's one of my favorites:"
1,"Jake you claim that you do not ""take everything from the bible literally and blindly""? and yet you still fail to give me reasons why homosexuality is wrong that are not religious.Amen. A that's a good video! Thank you for posting it."
2,"""why homosexuality is wrong that are not religious.""That is because God is involved with everything. You people keep talking about ""the bible the bible"", well if you don't believe in God which both of you don't than the it is irrelevant. This is about God."
1,"Me saying that you're a chore was never an argument. It was a statement about how I feel.And yes, this is about God.

Criticizing the country for it's wrongdoings is the most patriotic thing you can do."
2,"Yea, you just called me arrogant also without an argument as to why.Yep, pretty fickle alright.

1,"No, you don't understand what an ad hominem attack is. Insulting someone is not necessarily an ad hominem. Ad hominem is when you insult someone instead of addressing the argument in question.I wanted you to understand your hypocrisy for criticizing Pineapple for not using accepted debating technique and then doing the same thing to an even greater degree.How exactly did she falsely accuse the country of anything? She, along with anyone else who would want to, cannot marry someone of the sex due to the opinion of religion. I think that would qualify as religious oppression. Oppression: unjust or cruel exercise of authority or powerA religion is unjustly exercising its authority by forcing everyone in the country to heed by it's teachings. Your church specifically I might add was primarily responsible for the passage of Proposition 8 due it's significant funding of an intolerant and fear-mongering campaign.""I don't plan on adding a reason because it's so obvious.""I think this is your biggest problem. You accept everything your parents, priest, etc. tell you and don't even look for reasons because ""it's so obvious."""

If anything I'm the one that tried to tell people how ridiculous it is to do that. ""How exactly did she falsely accuse the country of anything?""By saying that this country allows oppression. It does not. Yes it has in the past. But nothing to that degree is going on right now.

1," Gay couples are raising children now, but at a disadvantage without the benefits of marriage Gay couples currently have the right to raise children and they are exercising that right. So, first, to claim that denying them marriage is somehow protecting children is counter to the de facto reality. Second, those homosexual couples that choose to raise children, but who are denied marriage, are denied the benefits to child-rearing that marriage offers. This is unfair to the children of homosexual couples.

The slaughter of Native Americans, slavery, segregation, Japanese internment camps are all particularly relevant. The degree of oppression is impossible to quantify and totally irrelevant. Any amount of oppression is completely and totally unacceptable. It is a fact that due to religious opinions in this country, same-sex marriage is illegal.

I responded to every one of your points and criticized something you said. And no it does not sound familiar to me.

And as I said even though past oppression may have been worse, it does not take away from the oppression now. But you failed to respond to that point, typically.No everything in that video is not true. Proposition 8 had nothing to do with schools or children. As I said in another recent post, under California law parents can remove their children from any health or family lesson. Proposition 8 did not even mention kids or adoption or education.""In a democracy if the majority believe that something is wrong then it is fair. The minority can get over it or move to another country.""Once again you demonstrate your complete lack of understanding of the Constitution. If you had a true or false question, ""Is America based on majority rules?"", the answer would be false. The system is set up with majority rules and minority rights with the latter not being an afterthought. The founders specifically set it up that way to avoid the kind of oppression that they experienced in Great Britain. The majority does not have the legal right to oppress the minority. Morally I strongly disagree with you that the oppressed minority should just ""get over it or move to another country."" Should the slaves have just gotten over it? But of course morals are opinions so neither of us is right. Legally, however, you couldn't be more incorrect."

1,"Pineapple let's give him the benefit of the doubt that he can't click links and I will tell him what the site says okay?Here were some of the lies spread by the Proponents of Prop 8:Prop 8 doesn't discriminate against homosexuals. Prop 8 took away a right that gays already had. They were able to get married, and the passage of prop 8 took away that right. Regardless of whether not you agree with prop 8, it took away a right they already had and therefore is discrimination.Children will be taught that same-sex marriage is ok I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you do not live in California. I cannot tell you how many ads I saw talking about how children would learn that homosexuality is alright. Regardless of how intolerant that is, it is a lie. Prop 8 mentioned nothing about education, and the California Superintendent of Schools Jack O'Connell assured everyone that Prop 8 did not even mention education and under California law, parents can remove their children from any health or family instruction they disagree with.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys6jnC11Svs There is no reason for them to be mentioning kids.Oh by the way in watching that clip I found a lie. Well more of a half-truth. ""Both presidential candidates support traditional marriage."" What they don't say is that Obama opposed prop 8 and any ban on same-sex marriage. He took a lame wishy-washy stance, but he still opposed prop 8 and the video implied that he did not.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiX5APGCroU&feature;=related A little under a minute and a half in: ""The rights of children are at risk. Children have the right to be raised by a mother and father."" This has nothing do with kids. Nothing in proposition 8 affected education or adoption. It was all lies and propaganda.Another gem in that video. ""We need to protect religious freedoms."" So how does forcing everyone else to abide by your religion protect religious freedom? That seems a bit bassackwards to me.Your religion was the main source of funds behind this campaign and all of these advertisements. Please I beg you, try to really think critically about all of this."
1,"Jake. Really?If you don't have anymore valid points then shut up!""we live in a country of religious freedom... where religion has the freedom to oppress.""NOT FALSE... I am very oppressed by your religion. Because of your religion, I can't marry a woman.If you don't make a valid point soon, you're going to look very stupid."

1,"A lot of little boys don't grow up without father figures. Should we take every kid away from single mothers?The thing is, Jake, that your morals are not exactly... moral.The judging of a couple's ability to raise a child is not up to you. Gay people have fine morals! They have jobs, they pay taxes, they participate in committed loving relationships, they love and respect their parents. In fact, aside from who they love, there is nothing more ""immoral"" about homosexuals than straight people at all.Other than what your faith teaches you, what don't you like about homosexuality?"

Now try your brain.Homosexuality has been a sin for only about 2000 years now... You are a product of brainwashing. I'm not going to say that again, because as a product, you can't understand it. But you need to open your mind and understand that there is nothing wrong with being gay!And again, the bible is not meant to be applied to law. So YES, gays should adopt.And what is a family to you?Family is an ambiguous word these days. I hope you don't have that picturesque little household with a white picket fence, with a mom and dad, and a Golden Retriever who brings in the paper, et cetera... because that would be weird.It's a matter of perception. And I have to tell you that other than biblical references, there is no excuse for thinking being gay is wrong. Or for thinking that gay people can't raise children. They aren't retarded. They understand the world, and the people in it. And they have love to give, and can create a stable environment for a child just as well as a straight couple. Every difference is trivial."

You are young and for gay marriage/adoption. So I can assume that you have been brainwashed by the mainstream media.

The media must tell you that image is bad. ""Or for thinking that gay people can't raise children.""Hey, if it makes you feel any better. I think most gay people would make better parents than a lot of straight parents. Many people should not be able to adopt kids. I'm not singling anyone out."
1,"Wow, you are a chore.I am calling you closed minded. You have to be willing to attempt to see the issue from the other person's point of view. I have tried to see this issue from your point of view, that of someone who believes that homosexuality is wrong because the bible says it to be so. But even if I accepted that, I would still have to forfeit that I can't find anything else wrong with it. So that one little fact, that the bible says it's wrong, isn't enough for me. But at least I have opened my mind and tried to understand it.My mind is always open, at least when I'm talking to logical people (ie. not belligerent or insane).I'm bisexual, remember? I was attracted to girls before I had even seen a television. So no, I'm not brainwashed. I'm fighting for what I know, and understand. I know I'm not an immoral person. I don't ""sin."" I'm a really good person, in fact. So to me, it feels like people want LGBT people to be all sinning and rebels and haters. No. We're just fun, sweet, people who are constantly attacked by a single idea that's seeded it's silly little butt into a whole mess of people's heads. The sinners are those hot Catholic school girls who take their shirts off for girls gone wild the second they get out of the house. In fact, that is what's wrong with the white picket fence scenario. It's too straight edge. The people who grow up in those houses don't, in my experience, even know what the real world is.By opening your mind, I want you to try and think of homosexuality as ""not a sin"" for maybe just a minute. And I know your faith tells you not to do that, but that is a method of self preservation of the Church. You don't have to change you entire ideals forever. I just want you to imagine, and think. Then once you're done, you can go back and apply those thoughts. It's not a bad thing to do. It's like looking in a mirror... just get a little outside prospective.You can vote however you like. It's your right. But, what I can do about it is try and help you understand that you are blindly hurting people and families by voting this way. You hurt people who just want to love and raise a family. And you are hurting families who are already established by invalidating their love for each other, and telling them it's blasphemy. If someone said that about your family or a member of your family, wouldn't it hurt you?I forgot you're a Mormon, and not just a Christian. A family, to me, is a unit of people who love each other. With or without children, with or without a traditional marriage, with or without money, a house or even a marriage license. A family is who you can always count on.That being said, I have a father and a mother. I also have a step mother, a step father, I have a sister, I have a brother, I have my niece, I have my niece's father, my nieces father's family, my cousins in Japan, my cousins in Poland, my cousins in Colorado, my aunts and uncles, and my grandma. All family.But do you know who my family is? My mother. That's it. My father is an abuser and a recovering alcoholic, my brother and sister are both schizophrenic and gone. So why is my mother my family? Because she taught me right from wrong, she never turned her back on me, and she will always love me. And yes, I'm young. But I've been through a lot of shit, and had a lot of life experience. And at the end of the day all I need is that love from my mother. If she were gay I wouldn't care, if she were autistic I wouldn't care, if she weren't even my real mother I wouldn't give a damn. because she loves me. So I know, that all it takes to raise a good kid is love and dedication. Screw the Church, screw the State."

And cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

1,"since we are to go off of your definition of natural and moral and your definition obviously doesn't come from the old testament, new testament, or the qu'ran, maybe you should elaborate on what you find acceptable and how you devine those value judgements.what is sin and which sins preclude adoption of kids who don't have parents?"
1,"There is nothing wrong with homosexuals and to be persecuted because of sexual orientation is wrong. If a gay couple wants a kid give them a kid. But I think that there could be consequences and pluses. But I think that letting them adopt children would be leading those children into an extremely awkward upbringing. That would make them outcasts. Kids are extremely brutal just read A Child's Machiavelli, everything rings true. Picture your average bully not only picking on a kid because of his looks but now he has a weapon that would make that kid a total outsider to all other kids. Kids find it odd when a kid has no father or mother, or when he/she lives with his/her grandparents or are adopted to a hetero family a kid with 2 fathers or mothers doesn't fit into the mix for a proper upbringing in a peers perspective at a young age. It would all lead down a messed up life for the kid down the road he would be confused with his sexual orientation and countless other issues.But then ,maybe all the toughness would make that kid an even better person than all the other kids that made fun of him or didn't step forward to defend him. I cannot say for sure since I have not had such an experience.But it is a free country and if one person can adopt another person should be able to as well."
2,"You bring up a very interesting point DaWolfman. Would gay adoption be unfair for the child? From my point-of-view, I would say no. If the parents were loving and caring, and the child was raised in a good household, then I would imagine it would be more of a benefit than a hindrance. As for the bullies on the playground picking on the kid, it is unfair but it happens. Children are picked on for a plethora of reasons: for their intelligence, hair, freckles, deformities, you name it. But I don't think that means they should compromise to fit the social norm (especially the social norm of a playground bully, whatever age that may be). But I do think you raised an interesting point. It would be intriguing to hear from a child who is raised by gay parents, or from an adult who was raised by gay parents. I think that would provide more of a psychological insight. They'd be a first-hand source."
1,There have actually already been studies that prove the latter is true that children raised by same sex parents turned out just fine. But I still cannot get over the idea in my head that they would not come out right. Just like everyone understood that the world was round but they just couldn't get it through their head that it wasn't flat =]

Also, I'm not saying they SHOULD adopt, but that they can, and it doesn't make much of a difference."
1,"This is actually a very prevalent issue. Gay adoption is still a widely debated subject. There are a few organizations trying to dismantle gay adoption (Here is an article from 2006...I'm sorry it's a bit old, but I feel like it still has weight to it: http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-02-20-gay-adoption_x.htm) )Also, you stated: ""...I'm not saying they should adopt, but that they can, and it doesn't make much of a difference.""

1,"I've never seen an argument for ""no"" backed up by scientific evidence. You'd think they'd notice that, but morons take to bigotry like fat kids to cake. 1. Gays are not confined to rigid gender roles as straights tend to be. The ""outsider perspective"" tends to give LGBT's a more astute view of society, and a frankness that's rare in straights. Give me AN EXAMPLE of how two male parents would be worse than a man and a woman.2. And no, it won't make the kid gay; There is no evidence to support that. There's also no evidence linking homosexuality with pederasty. There is no evidence to link gay households with problem children. Sorry, you're full of shit.3. The adoption screening process is excessive. And that's awesome. It means the average adoptive parent is far less likely to be abusive or neglectful, and they are guaranteed to WANT the child, unlike many straights."

1,It is called human rights people! It has already been proven through tedious studies that children adopted into same sex families turn out just the same as any other kid. So I have to say yes because to me the answer is obvious.
1,"Though I agree with your position, I feel like more questions need to be asked. For instance, how old are these studies? Are they still going on?Though I am for gay adoption, I do not think the answer is so obvious. It is stirring so much debate because gay adoption is going against the previous traditional values of American society, and any shift from one set of morals to another is bound to bring up some questions. So, yet again, I implore others who are against gay adoption to post and give their point-of-view. I would like to keep this debate as level as possible."
1,"The most important thing for a child to have in his or her life is a stable home, especially one where they can see a loving relationship. Yes, they need role models from both men and women. They need role models from as many types of people they can. I am a lesbian and I plan on having children eventually but I'm not going to seclude them from men. I have my father, my cousins, friends, and uncles all of whom I consider decent people and I'll make sure they can see all the types of lives in the spectrum. No study has shown that children raised by gay parents have more problems with gender roles or sexuality than those raised by straight couples. The only negative impact I can see is a child getting picked on for it but a) that is not the parents' fault but the society's and b) kids will always find something to make fun of because they are kids. It's what happens and, to an extent, it builds strength when paired with love from others. Hopefully, by the time my kids are old enough to learn what discrimination is, they world will be a bit better. And last- there are so many nameless kids in the system, why would we oppose something that puts them in loving homes?"
1,"My father walked out when I was three and my brother was six. Has our lack of a masculine finger crippled us horribly? No.This shouldn't even be a question. If two loving people are prepared to take a child into their home, out of a corrupt system that simply doesn't work, why would that not be allowed?"
1,"I've been reading the opposite side with a lot of interest and just like I expected, people have brought in a whole array of ""issues"" they have about homosexuality.First I read about how the motives of the gay person are selfishMy response: WHO CARES? I see an old lady crossing the street. I help her cross over. Did I do it because I truly cared for her or did I do cause I wanted to feel good about myself? Does it matter? As long as I didn't help her because I wanted to steal her purse in the process then where is the harm???? So what if gays want to satisfy their parental instincts by caring for a child? How does that undermine the care and the love? Don't straight couples do the same? How many times have I heard straight couples saying that they will have children because that ""completes the family"", that they can't wait to be great mums or great dads. That's selfish too isn't it? But is it wrong? Hell no! I would be worried of someone didn't have that streak of selfishness in them. In my opinion, the people that make the best parents are the ones that wanted to be parents in the first place. Not just procreate, but BE PARENTS afterward. Here we have people that are begging to be parents and we're telling them ""you can't! we'd rather leave the kids in the orphanage than give them to you!""Then it's about how it is unnatural for them to become parents because by definition they would be required to do something that is unnatural for them Right, so, should we exclude all infertile individuals from the right to adopt?Because the above argument basically implies that inability to conceive/procreate equals inability to perform as a parent, because nature didn't want you to become one in the first place. Isn't that ridiculous? The fact that we have children in foster care proves that the ability to conceive/procreate does not equal the ability to become a parent. So the two are clearly not cross linked.Then it's about how it is no one's right to adopt because the only person that has authority over a child is the biological parent - only they can ""appoint"" someone to look after their childSomeone actually used the word ""property"", the child is the property of the biological parents and no institution should ever have the right bypass them and give the child to someone else. Since when are human beings ""property""?As a parent, all you have, is the responsibility to raise the child and provide for it. That's all you have. You don't posses a child. No one has possession of another human being, however young. Now, I know for a fact that adoption agencies always look for people in the immediate or larger family that would foster the child. It's only when they have exhausted all those possibilities that the child is put up for adoption. In other words, no one in the family has offered to take over the responsibility! So it is then in the hands of the agency to find suitable parents from the general public. Let's be realistic, the family has absolved itself, or is not existent, or is mentally incapable. Now, I'm not saying everybody else then has the right to be their parent. But I think they do have the right to at least apply for the role, whether gay or straight. But the child is going to be bullied!Well, is that really an argument? If the kid is going to be bullied that's because the parents of the other children are bigoted and they have instilled that bigotry on their bully-kid. Kids are bullied everyday for being black, Muslim, Asian, tall, short, ginger etc etc. Does that mean we should take them away from their black, Muslim or ginger parents? The reality is, these kids are spending their life in an orphanage. I find it funny how people who are otherwise unwilling to adopt them, think that they have the right to obstruct others who do. And they justify it with an array of bigoted crap. And all this time, those kids remain in the orphanage, when they could be in the hands of very loving, very caring, very responsible people who could give them a much better life, a much better education and much more to experience."
1,"duh, a parent is a parent, and if they love their kid, it doesnt matter what gender they are."
1,"There's no reason they can't. It's not like they can have biological children without a suragate, and what if they don't like that option? Moreover, the children would just as happy a life with a gay couple as a straight couple."
1,"Why shouldnt they be able to, if they are willing to provide a safe loving home for kids without one, why keep the child from having a home jsut because the parents that want to adopt are gay?"
1,"one key point that should be included in the valuation is that the children that need to be adopted are often wards of the state and will live without any parents (typically in group homes, though sometimes in short or long term foster care). Is it better to have gay parents, or no parents?"
1,"I do believe that gays should adopt children. In my life I've seen children and teens be much better adjusted because they've had to go through not only the normal chaos of childhood with other children calling names and being mean but they've also had to go through what I might call an orientation that very few kids have...and that is that prejudice, hatred and a lack of understanding for the human condition so thoroughly exists in this world. I've seen them build both strength and character through their upbringing.I tell you what I've experienced personally and do not resort to the ""fact"" sheets. The facts are not in yet to any great degree in either direction. In 5-10 years we will have a greater amount of statistics to go by."

2,"The argument is invalid. What is particularly true in one instance cannot be inferred as universally true in all instances.Arguments that reason from that which is true in one example to a conclusion that is universal is fallacious.Example: andsoccer has hair, andsoccer is a male; therefore, all males have hair.Moreover, what is true today of your judgment may not be necessarily true in fact. Though your judgment may be valid today your judgment precludes your right to change your mind about something you are unaware of that would alter your judgment. Just because you have judged that a person is not gay today doesn't rule out the possibility that the judgment may change in the future.One last statement, for you, it's obvious that all homosexuals were raised by heterosexuals. And by reason of such, nobody can validly argue that the parents sexual orientation predetermines the sexual orientation of their children. (your welcome)"
1,"I'd like to know what you define as a ""normal"" mindset. Here's a link to the Child Welfare Information Gateway: http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/f_gay/f_gayb.cfm Children get teased for many reasons. ""Gay and lesbian parents are well aware of the difficulties that a child may face - many have dealt with prejudice all of their lives. Most see it as an opportunity for ongoing discussion that will help their children grow as people.""According to studies, ""Wendell Ricketts and Roberta Achtenberg, in the article ""Adoption and Foster Parenting for Lesbians and Gay Men: Creating New Traditions in Family"" from Homosexuality and Family Relations, address social workers grappling with the issue by asking, ""...should children be sheltered from every experience in which their difference might challenge prejudice, ignorance, or the status quo (or in which they would be 'exposed' to the difference of others)? Agencies conforming to such a standard must ask themselves whether it is their function to honor the system that generates stigma by upholding its constraints."" They continue, ""Teasing is what children do. Does this mean that child welfare policy must be set at a level no higher than the social interactions of children?""""The bulk of evidence to date indicates that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are no more likely to become homosexual than children raised by heterosexuals. As one researcher put it, ""If heterosexual parenting is insufficient to ensure that children will also be heterosexual, then there is no reason to conclude that children of homosexuals also will be gay"". 11""Studies asking the children of gay fathers to express their sexual orientation showed the majority of children to be heterosexual, with the proportion of gay offspring similar to that of a random sample of the population. An assessment of more than 300 children born to gay or lesbian parents in 12 different samples shows no evidence of ""significant disturbances of any kind in the development of sexual identity among these individuals"". 12""Courts have expressed concern that children raised by gay and lesbian parents may have difficulties with their personal and psychological development, self-esteem, and social and peer relationships. Because of this concern, researchers have focused on children's development in gay and lesbian families.The studies conclude that children of gay or lesbian parents are no different than their counterparts raised by heterosexual parents. In ""Children of Lesbian and Gay Parents,"" a 1992 article in Child Development, Charlotte Patterson states, ""Despite dire predictions about children based on well-known theories of psychosocial development, and despite the accumulation of a substantial body of research investigating these issues, not a single study has found children of gay or lesbian parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents.""Psychiatrist Laurintine Fromm, of the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, agrees with that finding. ""[The] literature...does not indicate that these children fare any worse [than those of heterosexual parents] in any area of psychological development or sexual identity formation. A parent's capacity to be respectful and supportive of the child's autonomy and to maintain her own intimate attachments, far outweighs the influence of the parent's sexual orientation alone."""

Some kids have a mommy, and two daddies. Some kids have a mommy M-F and a daddy Saturday and Sunday.Children aren't stupid. They are way more open to new situations than adults, and most children these days, and very understanding.

1,"I wrote a paper a few years back on this topic and I can tell you that everything you state here has no validity. Don't get me wrong, it has points that many make but there are plenty of studies out there that will put you at ease.First, I would recommend you do a little research on childhood psychology. Second, adolescent children will at some point become curious in sexual activity and it is the parent's responsibility to inform them appropriately. This comes from a parental unit, regardless of sexual orientation. There are good and bad parents out there and not all will inform their children. My point it that parents are parents and some are good at it; others are bad. Finally, if you are trying to insinuate that because someones parents are gay they will become gay themselves is ludicrous. I'm sure you're using the ""monkey see, monkey do"" ideology. Let me ask you this, Heterosexual parents have children that are gay so your ideology is flawed. One last note, on a personal level: What makes you think children will perceive their family as abnormal just on the premise if they're gay? I was proud of my family, my father was overweight and my mother was from Spain (i was made fun of for years on top of having horrible acne in High School). Growing up in a small town almost entirely made up of white republican Catholics, I was abnormal; I knew I was different. Guess what, I'm doing just fine. And I'm not overweight and proud of my dual nationality. If anything it brought about a better sense of self."
2,"In my own personal opinion being homosexual isn't right and thats it.And the communites around me doesn't get too involved in homosexual activicties even the government.It's common to see girls and boys hanging out together but not boys and boys hugging each other touching here an there.Kids learn from their parents and it's monkey see monkey do. When babies were born, they are weak and they are dependant on their mothers or those whom they think is his/her parents that he/she could relate to. Kids learn from their parents because it's the parents responsiblity to teach their children what is right and what is wrong and not someone elses.Unless you're trying to prove to me that the parent's role isn't to teach the children what is nature and what is not according to nature etc. you cannot have sex with a man like you did with a woman.It's impossible unless that man was a woman before a sex change operation and was reluctant to change her organs.What 'most' debate i saw about how homosexuality is morally accepted by people utterly shocked me to the core. I'm not sure what kind of world are you in but i certainly do not accept it as 'normal'because it is abnormal and going against nature.Firstly, the environment i grew up in doesn't have too much catholics and christians but mostly made up of other religions. I personally abhor christianity because of its contradictions and it's violation of karma.One quote i recieved from my friend who is a christian. He was determined to convert me from a buddhist to a christian but once i heard it i brushed him aside.'If you don't believe in Jesus christ, you shall go to hell'.This is a total piece of bullshit, who in the world needs to go to hell when he is accumulating merits here and there is no such thing as absolute creator god who creates the whole universe in seven days.And god don't love us too.If he has the powers of a clairvoyant and loves us, if he saw the future of man he would'nt have created us in the first place. He would'nt have created Adam and Eve in the first place.And if he truly is an absolute god he would'nt have creatd lucifer whom he knew that one day lucifier is going to turn bad and become satan.Christianity is bulljunk and i totally hate it.Although i hate christianity i don't really hate christians.I only dislike those who is obessed with it."
2," ALL major world religions support marriage between a man and a woman. While some support multiple wives, NONE support homosexuals marrying. Religion recognizes the central importance of ""creation of family"" as the fabric of the human race. To the extent that mankind recognizes spiritual importance and the source of all creation, mankind must raise marriage to a Sacramental elevation. We are free to worship as we ought, and free to define just how to elevate marriage. But the fact that religion elevates marriage does not segregate it into a religious-only institution. The fact remains that throughout history, regardless of religion, ALL societies from primitive to developed have established some form of marriage to reproduce new generations of people.

1,"""Homosexuality is not natural""This is the most preposterous item I've heard in years. Are you ignorant to what is natural and not?!Acceptance vs taboo If you know anything about animal and human sexuality you would properly acknowledge that homosexuality has been around since the existence of sexuality. Animals display it on a daily routine. Alexander the Great, one of the most powerful men in ancient history, had many homosexual tendencies. (even on a more intense level of pedophilia) As an evolving society, homosexuality was bound to get to the point it has today. Let me also add that if you knew anything about the adoption procedure and the psychological harm that those who go through adoption have to deal with, it would pale to comparison to the teasing they would go through in their schooling.My point is that on items of sexuality it is not all monkey see monkey do. I have so many points and so little time. I'm very happy to see the down votes. (means I'm getting to you people!)As for your opinion, I'm not here to change it. I'm just here to point out all the fallacies in your argument."

1,"I understand that people who are ignorant and uneducated may think that 'gayness' is contagious. Let me assure you, it isn't.During childhood, everyone is laughed at for something.No child will assume a man gave birth to them if the parents explain things the way all parents do. Did you assume your father gave birth to you until your mother said she did?It is alright if he is gay too. There is nothing wrong with being gay. Their is something wrong with judging people and telling children that their gay parents are sinners and are going to hell.There is something wrong with laughing at a child for having two parents who love them. Any orphan would gladly take two fathers or two mothers over no parents any day of the year."
1,"it's not about whether the parents are gay or straight, it's about how they raise their children, with truth or with lies, open minds or fear. both straight and gay parents are capable of both, their sexuality is irrelevant.during anyone's childhood others may laugh at them for random reasons. the child wouldn't mind having happy gay parents and getting laughed at by mindless kids as much as he/she might mind having a straight couple as parents if they gets divorced or have a drug addiction or are abusive.if a gay child grows up with straight parents, they don't fit in either. he might think he is straight. the mindset would stay with him for a long time, also. and that would be just as wrong as what you claimed.when teaching about reproduction gay parents would have to tell the child where babies come from and how they do so. being gay doesn't mean they will make up some story about how gay people can conceive. they could, but being gay doesn't mean they will. what about all the straight parents who tell their kids they come from cabbages?"

I don't see the difference here.For that matter, how does a single mother explain ""boy stuff?""

The differences go way deeper than trivial or cosmetic.Women cannot pass masculinity to a male child. A boy cannot learn from a woman what it means to truly be a man just as two men cant teach a young woman what it means to become a real woman. Two women cant do any better raising a boy to be a man than a single mother can, and we all know what that has done to entire generations of young men. The damaging effects on children from the absence of a father in a family is well documented. When it comes to the matter of masculinity its just not possible. Its not that its wrong...its just not possible.Truly I am sorry. I didn't mean to step on toes. Just my non-authoritarian opinion."

1,"""ill behaved people ruin things in this country""Yeah like those asses who are intolerant of other's existence when they have done absolutely nothing wrong but to live."
1,good strategy - I hadn't thought of just picking the other side and making a stupid argument - way to help illuminate some of the ludacris things people on the other side tend to say. hopefully that is what you are doing.
1,I think that everyone should be given the chance to care for a child. And it all depends how you best give the proper guidance and love for your children. But I am not still favor of gays adopting a child. Child should be well-guided and be nurture and I believe that only a legitimate couple complete with a mom and dad could only provide this. There are studies that children with no father image at home tend to engage more into drugs and other things. This is also the same case if mom is not around. I believe this could be worsen if you are reared by parents who has the same gender.
2,"Gays folks should not adopt for a very simple reason. No American baby, adolescent, toddler, teen, or adult (young or mature) would receive the proper nourishment, values, or knowledge with same sex parents. Also, the Man upstairs made it possible to procreate between a man and a woman. Don't you think we ought not argue with the creator of all things?"
2,"I really can't stand downvoting and I would like to know the culprit who is responsible for downvoting my arguments. If you believe gay adoption is good or acceptable, then fine. I don't. I think being gay is not mainstream enough for a child to feel comfortable in a gay household. But fine, allow it. Then compare the children living with gay couples and the children living with straight couples. I'm positive there'd be a huge difference, psychologically speaking.P.S. I have NOTHING against the gay community. I think it is completely natural. Society deems otherwise."
2,"I wish they could. I think many gay couples would be much better parent than a lot of heterosexual couples; you can't really have an ""accident"" if you're gay. But, I have been a kid and I know that children are extremely cruel. The adopted child of a gay couple would likely be put through a living hell by his peers."
2,"All homosexuals, male or female, who would adopt a child, are acting in a manner that is contrary to the nature and consequences of homosexuality. For by reason of their supposed natural, sexual orientation, as they call it, their actions negate the possibility of becoming progenitors as a consequence. Moreover, the homosexual nature also axiomatically negates the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors as parents as well as negating the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors to place their well-being as secondary and a child’s primary. However, before they have attempted to adopt a child, all homosexuals have already, in life, demonstrated the predispositional consequences of their sexual orientation which evidence the fact that they cannot put the well-being of anyone before their own subjective well-being. For don’t all homosexuals act contrary to the heterosexuality of their parents from which, as a consequence, they were born into this world? Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families? So it should be understood that any homosexual male or female who wants to adopt a child is both, acting contrary to his/her sexuality, and is attempting to make the well-being of a child secondary; for homosexuals who want to adopt a child are choosing to do so for themselves and never because a child wants to be raised by homosexual males or females. In conclusion: if adoption is acceptable in a society, the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives and never the public or an institution. For neither the public nor any institution can be held accountable for sorry decisions that ill-affect a child; whereas a parent who gives up its’ child for adoption must live with the consequences of that decision and will therefore choose as wisely as is possible in a manner that agrees with the nature of the parent.Homosexual males and females refuse to be parents. And therefore no rational person ought to give their child to a person who is incapable of acting against his or own nature."
1," Heterosexual couples often ""recklessly procreate""; gay adoption is deliberate This means that homosexuals are less likely to become accidental parents, who are much more likely to become neglectful parents.

"
1,"The progenitors give up their authority to the child the second they give it up for adoption. I'm sorry to say that your conclusion is flawed in that regard.If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child. Hence the term ""give him/her up for adoption"". You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.I must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality."
2,"Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species."
1,"If I understand your logic correctly, your argument is that since homosexual's cannot naturally produce a child, they have no right to become parents. Am I hearing this correctly?"
2,"No statement contained within any of my arguments asserts that homosexuals are biologically incapable of sexual reproduction; the terms of my arguments were carefully chosen so as to not exclude the ability of homosexuals to sexually reproduce. Yet, in order for them to sexually reproduce and propagate their genetics through a progeny they must act contrary to their nature and have unprotected sex with the opposite gender, and probably more than once.  Now, since they actually are biologically capable of becoming progenitors we must therefore conclude they are not willing to do what is necessary to become parents. They choose to do that which will never produce offspring and are suffering the consequences of their choices; moreover, if they don’t like the consequences of their choices they ought to change their minds. Conclusion: Individuals of the homosexual orientation can become progenitors. Yet, they choose to not do what must be done in order to become progenitors.  And finally, no man or woman has the right to become a parent. Parenthood is not a right; parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction. And no man or woman can justly claim authority over the progeny of another progenitor without the progenitor’s conference of authority over its progeny."
1,"Well spoken, yet I cannot agree with you. In your conclusion you state that there is an aspect of choice. There are a few ways I can interpret your second sentence. (in the conclusion) Here is mine, individuals of homosexual orientation can become progenitors by choice, but must do this by an act that goes against their sexual orientation. Thus, their sexual orientation is against that of a progenitor and since progenitors are what create life and that very creation of life is a consequence of sexual reproduction, parenthood is formed. Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in. Yes, parenthood is, in part, the result of progenitors, but it is also very much so the raising and the nurturing aspect as well. When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood. You state that parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction, which I do not disagree, but another aspect of parenthood is the raising and nurturing. Having the ability to raise or nurture or both does not have reference to sexual orientation. Since this is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent. Perhaps they aren't the progenitors, but are fully capable of parenting. Thus, any human can posses the abilities to parent. Because of this a homosexual couple can posses the abilities to parent and thus have a right to be offered the option of adoption."
2,"Yes, you have rightly understood the conclusion of my recent argument with which you do not agree. Next, you stated in the second paragraph,” Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in.”My response:The premise posits that the term parenthood has, ’many definitions’. It also, propositionally, establishes that the argument is based upon multiple definitions of the same term. (This is a non- discreet way of using the fallacy of ambiguity to argue through to an ambiguous conclusion.) The introduction of ambiguity into a debate is nothing more than an attempt to redefine the key term/s of the debate to prove a predetermined a conclusion. And moreover, the explicit claim that more than one definition will be used for the same term invalidates the entirety of the argument. However, disregarding what your intent may or may not be, I will continue with my rebuttal of the remainder of your argument wherein we disagree.You stated:When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood. My response:If what you claim is true then let’s test the principle of that proposition by application of the principle. The principle: When a man or woman no longer wants to be responsible for that which is theirs, they no longer have rights to that which is theirs. (Lucidly stated for the debate)A. A husband and wife decide they want to get rid of their house; they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the house.B. A husband and wife decide to offer up their car for free; they no longer have a right to choose whom takes the car.C. A husband and wife decide to give up their animal pets; they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the pets.All three examples contradict the reality of the transfer of ownership. Albeit, a thief is more likely to agree with the examples than the common person. For the thief presumes it is now his/her property for the taking.All parents have the natural law of authority of ownership and must first transfer that authority unto another party before another party can rightfully claim the same authority over the respective property whether it is of children, vehicles, houses, or pets. Let’s move on to the next statement. You claimed: Since this, (to raise or nurture), is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent. My response:Children of the age 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, demonstrate that it is possible for them to possess a nurturing or raising nature; therefore they are possible targets to be parents. Individuals who suffer from diseases of the mind also meet the same criteria. Should they too be allowed to adopt? Pedophiles exactly meet the criteria. Should they be allowed to adopt? The most hardened criminals meet the criteria. Should they be allowed to adopt?The ultimate conclusion, logically deduced from my arguments, is that no man, woman, or institution has authority to determine the recipient of the transfer of authority of that which is not theirs to begin with, including myself. No one in the world has a right to adopt. No institution in the world has a right to adopt. For if we argue that some have a right to adopt then we must reason that they have authority to steal that which belongs to another person.A homosexual has no right to adopt. However, the sister of a homosexual has the authority to transfer authority of her child to her homosexual sibling. No right is necessary. And the friend of the sister has no right to determine the recipient of the authority.Therefore, no gay has a right to adopt. Which is the actual question of the debate."
1,"From my understanding, the Topic is Gay adoption and should the opportunity of adoption be extended to those in a homosexual relationship. Whether if be a man and a man or a women and a women as a couple having the opportunity to raise a child. Also, the topic makes mention of human interaction with the child, during the raising and nurturing, from a male and a female. Can the same be done with two of the same sex? I would argue that you cannot compare apples to oranges. That is why I was interested in the specific points of nurture and the ability to raise. Which you so eloquently wrote out and felt the need to go into an extreme situation. While I do understand what you are stating, that is why we have a legal system in place. This is to prevent what US society would not consider a suitable parent. What you fail to address is how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit. Please refer to the 1st page of this book:source: http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=NcmXvBX--agC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PR3&dq;=adoption+law&ots;=bMKbElPtsd&sig;=EGnN46PrECgKj75qw1uluX0GcnM#PPA1,M1 You will find that adoption is considered: the creation of a parent-child relationship by judicial order between two parties who usually are unrelated."
2,"In the beginning of my argument I explained why I would not choose to allow a homosexual to adopt. Primarily, the homosexual is inescapably self-centered. The conclusion is to be understood as a universal statement of all homosexuals, not particular. And hence, no explanation is required when it’s two homosexuals seeking to adopt. However, I will now take the time to compound my argument with additional facts after already having logically established my position.  You claim that my argument, ‘fail(s) to address (is) how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit. My reply is yes, I did not address that question, now consider my explanation. You are requesting that I prove a negative conclusion, i.e. how a gay couple would NOT make a suitable parental unit. It is logically impossible to prove a negative conclusion. I cannot syllogistically arrive at a negative conclusion from negative propositions. The burden of proof belongs to those who claim that homosexuals are suitable parents. Consider the example of what you have accused my argument of lacking.Gays are bad, the bad should not adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is valid, but it is petition principii, begging the question. Gays are not good, only the good should adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is invalid and fallacious.Gays are perverts, perverts are evil; therefore, gays should not adopt. Argument is both invalid and fallacious.Gays are not evil, evil is not good; therefore, gays are not good. (Again invalid and fallacious) Or you could say: 1 is not 2, 2 is not 3; therefore 1 is not 3. . (Again invalid and fallacious)There are an unlimited number of examples that I could use to demonstrate the impossibility of syllogistically proving a negative conclusion. I suppose the examples I’ve provided shall suffice for the subject at hand.They who would argue that homosexuals are suitable parents must be burdened by the burden of proof to logically prove their point.  I truly did go to an extreme conclusion in my last argument, as you have stated. Yet, only for the purpose of reductio ad absurdum, reducing the proposition until it is obviously false. And lastly, your reference to the legal system is an appeal to authority, Argumentum Ad Verecundium. (the truth, falsity, or validity of an argument is not subject to a legal system)Bare in mind that my arguments are for the sake of knowledge and not the sake of attacking or debating; so take no offence for none is intended."
1,"No offense taken, I rather enjoy a good debate. I see where I've been butting my head the whole time. I've been trying to comprehend/grasp the concept, logically, of the homosexual being inescapably self-centered. Please explain. I understand the logic of your explanation on the topic of the negative conclusion. Burden of proof: I must understand your logic prior to being able to bring up this in a logical manner. Please forgive me for having you reiterate your main point but I must understand it."
2,"Hello,Pardon the delay.Is sex a crime? No, sex is not a crime. Can a crime be committed by sex? Yes, rape is a crime against another person, which generally implies forced sex. Is the desire for sex a crime? (No) Can a crime be committed as a consequence of a desire for sex? Yes, for a rapist desires to have forced sex with another person. In these examples it can be seen that neither sex nor the desire for sex are crimes and that some crimes are sexual. All physically, healthy men and women are fully capable of committing sexual crimes. However, and thankfully, most do not commit sexual crimes. Most men and women choose to not force themselves sexually unto another person. They are therefore making a conscious decision. Furthermore, all decisions about with whom they will have sex with are choices evidencing their desire. The desires of all men and women are consequences, not causes. Then what is the cause of desire? Is it internal or external? Is it genetic? In order to answer these questions I must begin with some fundamentals of the lives of all men and women.All men and women are responsible for the choices they make; they both suffer or benefit from the consequences of their choices; they also cannot rightfully be held accountable for the choices that others have made. For example, Person (A) cannot be justly imprisoned because of the crimes of person (B). Also, if person (A) is coerced by person (B) to perform a certain act or speak a certain word, person (A) has chosen to comply and is therefore responsible. Person (A) suffers the consequences of compliance or resistance; in either situation, person (A) remains responsible for his/her choices. Regardless of the specific choices that men and women make, all choices are consequences of their desires. Ultimately, we can conclude that all men and women will choose according to their desire and must accept the consequences whether they are joyful or sorrowful. The desire of man is predicated upon at least one value system. And from that value system are all desires identifiable. Simply stated, the value systems are as follows:1) My needs are more important than the needs of another person. (Identity=selfish,unjust)2) My needs are equally as important as the needs of another person. (Identity=just,honest)3) My needs are less important than the needs of another person. (Identity=affectionate)I have completed my response. But I have only posted part no.1. We can debate this part before we move on to part 2. I have yet to logically tie the pieces together."
1," Biblical passages that are claimed by anti-gay believers to condemn homosexuality are being misinterpreted by these groups The Bible does not actually give any mention to homosexuality as a whole, but only homosexual acts. It does condemn certain specific homosexual acts, but in a context that does not clearly indicate a condemnation of homosexuality. For example, the Sodomites were condemned to death by God before sodomy was performed. The act of sodomy in that specific, inappropriate context was condemned, but should not be misinterpreted as the cause of the ultimate condemnation of the Sodomites.

1,"Not quite true. Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings. In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on. There is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics, but the possibility is a strong one.Here is a video that explains the idea better"
2,"I am very surprised that you would opt to oppose an argument of mine so soon after our last debate. Perhaps you enjoyed the debate? Let’s see where round number two shall lead the discourse. You asserted: The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective.You state that my argument has a problem; however, you then move onto affirming that my view of evolution is of a simplistic perspective. Your proposition is identical in principle to the following proposition: The problem with your car is that you are looking at the gas cap from the wrong side. Both propositions are simply irrational.Moreover, instead of identifying the problem of my argument, your argument proceeds to make claims that have not been syllogistically demonstrated. The argument presumes that the audience grants the propositions without argument; unless of course your argument is purely hypothetical. And lastly, there is an abundance of uncertainty in your argument, which in turn calls into question the wherefore of asserting such things.A. They may makeB. More likelyC. Fairly obviousD. Must beE. More likelyF. No definitive proofG. The possibility is a strong oneDo you simply want to engage in a debate? If so, name the subject-matter.But, only for the purpose of knowledge."
1,But you are operating under a simplistic view of evolution for your argument. You even seemed to show your ignorance of the difference between a mechanism for evolution(natural selection) and the theory of evolution itself. We're not entirely certain if or how natural selection works on humans. Being sentient beings seems to mess with the dynamic a bit.
2,"Before I begin, the following reminder is in order :In biology, evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. These changes are caused by a combination of three main processes: variation, reproduction, and natural selection. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EvolutionI suppose your reply is an attempt to rebut my assertions: ""Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species.""; And that your reply is in favor of: ""Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings. In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on. There is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics, but the possibility is a strong one.My response:Consider the consequences of supporting the opposition’s argument.If homosexuality is a consequence of evolution and such a consequence is for the purpose of the survival of a species; how does homosexuality benefit the survival of a group of its species? We can immediately infer that evolution has removed the homosexual from genetically contributing to its own species. And thus, the genetics of the homosexual are not conducive to the survival of the species, but are destructive of the survival of the species. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Evolution excludes certain individuals from genetic contribution to its species through homosexuality for the survival of the group for the survival of the species. Furthermore, evolution has eliminated certain genetic consequences from genetically multiplying with members of its own species.We can also infer that all groups of species are beneficiaries of the homosexuality of the individuals of their group. Is the author implying that in order for sexual reproduction to propagate the species more effectively, certain individuals must be homosexual so that others will not be homosexual? The author invalidly reasons: “In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the (human) population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.Either the author is attempting to insult the intelligence of the audience of this debate or is guilty of granting that which is unreasonable. (I don’t think the author intentionally does either one, but unintentionally accomplishes both.) If we were to reason according to the example by the author we can arrive at some very interesting conclusions. For example:The prevalence of inbreeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that inbreeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of cannibalism in other species makes it fairly obvious that cannibalism among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of random breeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that random breeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of vomit consumption in other species makes it fairly obvious that the consumption of vomit among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of butt-licking in other species makes it fairly obvious that butt-licking among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. Just because certain things are true of many other species doesn’t allow any man or woman to validly infer the same is true of another species. This is called in layman terms: jumping to conclusions.  If you were to reread and carefully consider the assertions of my original argument as re-posted above, you will see that the assertions are subjective on the behalf of the proponents of evolution. The propositions only indicate the inescapable conclusions that the theory supports. I did not assert that the theory of evolution accounts for all that is known of the processes of life’s continuity. Nor did I suggest one should embrace the theory.  I have simplistically explained some of the consequences of some of the supposed complexity of the theory of evolution. And by doing such, I have demonstrated that wherein I reference evolution, I can reduce the supposed complexity of that subject of the theory of evolution to its simple illogical conclusions. And for this reason I am not troubled by an accusation that I view evolution simplistically. (Albeit, my argument is particular, yet I was accused of an universal argument.) Another issue that I must address, before I am accused of neglecting it, is the matter of social contributions made by homosexuals, both tangible and intellectual. Whether a homosexual or any other person has made any tangible or intellectual contribution that enabled/s the survival of a species is purely fallacious. Speculations of what one person has or has not done that conclusively contributed to the survival or destruction of a species are of the fallacy, argumentum ad speculum. We can indefinitely speculate by hypothetical reasoning that which may have been or should have been. Yet, until there is conclusive evidence that would lend itself to the scrutiny of sound reasoning that concludes that any member, or group of any species is a necessary cause or consequence of/for the survival or death of a species, we should not speculate that it is obvious. Can we speculate that we would be ignorant of the law of gravity if Kepler and Newton were never born? Can we speculate that we are alive today because of that knowledge? Yes, we can speculate about anything, but we cannot rationally speculate unto a definitive conclusion that is reasonably useful.One last thing before I end this rebuttal; my rebuttals explain the wherefore of my propositions. Your rebuttals on the other hand evidence nothing that supports your argument. Your arguments seem to always come in the form of either a straw-man, ad hominem, or red-herring fallacy. In fact, there is no argument in your rebuttals. You simply assert whatever you think is ad populum. A little advice: if you are unwillingly to take the time to support your case, I suggest that you forego rebutting the arguments of someone who will take the time. However, I welcome your legitimate attempts to support your views that are contrary or contradictory to my arguments."
2,"You sated:""The progenitors give up their authority to the child the second they give it up for adoption. I'm sorry to say that your conclusion is flawed in that regard. If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child. Hence the term ""give him/her up for adoption"". You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.""My response:Your argument is an excellent example of the fallacy, self-refutation. The argument affirms in one statement that which it denies in another. You argument asserts that a progenitor gives up its authority to the child when the progenitor gives up the child for adoption. It therefore must be also true when state agencies give up children for adoption they too have no authority. Explain why the argument expresses the denial of authority for the progenitor in the case of adoption while consequently implying the affirmation of authority of state agencies that too seek adoption for a child. Whether your argument is willful deception or a logical error remains for you to decide.Next, reread the conclusion and you will find: ’ …..the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives’…... The child remains under the authority of the parent until the child is adopted. You attempted to redefine that which was previously defined in the argument, and your argument is attempting to establish the straw-man fallacy.Again, you stated: 'You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.'Therefore in accord with that proposition the following is valid:Society accepts homosexuality. Therefore, homosexuality is an institution.Society accepts masturbation. Therefore, masturbation is an institution.Society accepts stupidity. Therefore, stupidity is an institution.Society accepts whatever. Therefore, whatever is an institution.Reductio ad absurdum!Again, you stated:'If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child. 'What do you mean by maintaining a child? Your arguments are validating my arguments.Parents maintain their cars, houses, lawns, toilets, tubs, sex toys, etc., but never can it be said that they maintain their children, unless of course they are alike janitors and maintenance personnel. Parents, through out the life of either themselves or their children, always strive to care for their progeny in whatever capacity is required at any given time and provide both tangible and abstract necessities. You assert: “I must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality.”Your final statement doesn’t challenge any assertion in paragraph one. Moreover, paragraph one of the argument is not a psychological description of any subject and hence cannot be psychologically valid or invalid. It is however an argument that is demonstratively evidenced by the deeds of homosexuals. No attempt was made in my argument to suggest a description of the mind or the thought processes of male or female homosexuals.And lastly, if homosexuals are that caring why would they adopt a baby that they cannot breast feed? For breastmilk is the best milk for infants. All companies that produce baby formula admit that their products are second best. The natural order of life among animals is predicated upon the breast milk of the mother. And just because female homosexuals can be made pregnant by methods contrary to nature doesn’t mean they should be a mother; for by reason of their nature they will not naturally become mothers."
1,"It's not in our nature to fly but we build airplanes. The inability to CONCEIVE children is a consequence of homosexuality, but in no way reflects on ones ability to raise and love a child. Does not.""Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families? ""uh... NO.So Gay people being themselves are pleasing themselves by making their parent sad when they come out? What? There are more assumptions in this statement than I care to address. Not all gay people are pleased with being gay due to the society we are in, and to assume all parents hate to hear their kid is gay just completely shows us how twisted your logic is.Wouldn't your statement also be true if you brought home a someone of a different race to your racist parents? You see where your line of thought is coming from? Bigotry. The assumption that there is something existentially negative about being gay."
2,What inability to conceive children????````````````````````````````````
1,It was referring to the inability to conceive with one's partner through direct sexual intercourse. Read the entire argument. This was the context he set up in his premise.
2,"Your first argument compares two things that are not related; this is a fallacy of faulty analogy. The ability to fabricate an aircraft does not evidence an ability to raise and love a child. The argument does not deductively evidence why any person, gay or not gay, can raise and love a child. Moreover, you have asserted that homosexuals are not able to conceive children. Therefore, we can deduce from your claim that homosexuals are biologically deprived of the necessary organs for the conception of a child. Lastly, the argument is ineffective in proving any thing syllogistically. And as for the remainder of your claims and rhetorical questions they don’t deserve refutation. The entirety of the argument fails to prove one thing that has been validly deduced by the author.  Your final statement,” The assumption that there is something existentially negative about being gay.” A. It is a sentence fragment. The subject is identified but there is no predicate. B. You affirmed there is something that is existentially negative about being gay; they cannot conceive children. Your whole of your argument begins with irrationality and ends with irrationality.I expect that your future reply will also be equally irrational."
1,"""The ability to fabricate an aircraft does not evidence an ability to raise and love a child.""Neither does the ability to conceive a child."

1,Hi LM! What allows you to assume that gay people don't have a parental bone in their body? Many gay people want children. That gene or set of brain cells were surely there at birth even though others were not!
2,"Hello K,Simplified answer: Healthy human beings who choose to not propagate their own sons and daughters are doing such for selfish reasons. For the record: I despise the state institution of adoption. Thou shalt not covet…No man or woman can provide a reasonable justification for transgressing that commandment. The fact that there exists a supposed argument that would justify the act of coveting the sons and daughters of other humans is evidence to me of a people who are dead to the words of the commandments.If you would care for a more specific explanation, I have no problem submitting additional information."
1,"Hi LM...Yes, please do because I certainly cannot relate homosexuals who adopt to coveting anything I can think of."
2,"Hello,This debate should be private. If you'll initiate a new debate that is private, I'll thoroughly represent the principles of my viewpoint within that format.I perceive you are asking a legitimate question concerning my understanding of adoption; I care to only discuss the matter with you.

1,should a couple not covet to adopt a child that has no parents?? would that be covetousness or charity?
1,"Heres where you screwed yourself... well first off, in your mother's basement, where you obviously reside.Secondly, when you said, ""Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families?""I believe that you're implying that all families are sad and distraught over their child's homosexuality? This is not the case.Homosexuality can be accepted, tolerated, and celebrated. Just because you are a homosexual doesn't mean that you are in defiance of anything.You are embracing your own feelings. You are being true to yourself. I would argue that someone who does not love themselves, should not attempt to love anyone else. You have to love yourself, and you have to have a genuine love for someone else in order to successfully raise a child. The child understand that love. He or she can learn that there are many types of love, and that it can be expressed in whatever way, with whomever he or she finds suitable for them. But that child needs just an example of love.Shut up and listen, for once.Love is all you need."
2,"Your argument begins with foolishness and ends with foolishness.If you look, read, and understand the folly between your foolish statement, and foolish command, you will realize that you provided evidence that proves the point of my argument. Do you make it a habit of contradicting yourself?"
1,"Argument: Religions ""rules"" only apply to those who believe in that religion For example, if a Christian man opposes homosexuality because of his religion, he'll not marry another man to ""obey the rule"". But that does NOT mean that he has the right to decide if other individuals can/cannot marry. If your religion doesn't allow homosexuality, then just keep it to yourself; why not let others? It's not like everyone in the world believes in your religion.
"
1,if a man and women are not able to have kids naturally should they be prevented from adopting
2,"This is a touchy subject. However, I believe that it's important for a child to have been raised by a mother and a father. Each parent gives his or her child different life lessons and raises a child differently. Sure, one man could act as the father and the other as the ""mother"", but I think gender is a factor in how you raise your child, no matter sexual orientation. And then there's single parents. The difference there is that they are open to dating other people, so the boyfriends or girlfriends can come into the home and help the single parent in raising his or her child."
1,"But then what happens if there is a family with a mother and a father, but, say, they get divorced, or a parent dies, or something, and then there is only one parent? Is the child going to come out of childhood 'messed up,' or different, like you say would happen? There are plenty of examples of successful, well-rounded adults coming out of homes of all types, ones with only a father, many with only a mother, so I don't see the difference, in your example, if there is a single parent or two parents of the same gender."
1,"Hey, guess who in a child's life is most likely to abuse him or her?Yep, the boyfriends and girlfriends of that single parent. Good job, you just hypothetically got your hypothetical kid hypothetically raped.Give an example of what ONLY a female or ONLY a male can teach a child. Not something that could easily be researched."
1,"I agree with HGrey's point here about the subjectivity of gender. I do not think there are specific things that can be ""taught"" through ONLY one gender. However, I do think having a parent of that gender helps; a daughter would want to talk to her mother about her period, if given the choice. But fathers can definitely talk about it as well (even though it might be a bit uncomfortable).To quickly state my piece:Yes, I believe gay parents should be able to adopt. I do not think a child needs a mother and father to get a healthy perspective on things. I found an old article about this issue a while ago: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/us/26florida.html It was about the Florida ban on gay adoption that was ruled unconstitutional (but you can see that from the title).I even found an older article about a ""new take"" on the American family: http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/25/gay.adoption/index.html By doing a quick google search, you can see that it is not on the forefront of the political crossfire as gay marriage is, but it is a important issue. I think one of the main reasons it makes people so uncomfortable is that everyone feels like they know how to rear children the best, whether it is with homosexual parents, hetoersexual parents, single parents, or whatever. It is a touchy issue for most people, since everyone has to listen to their mother-in-laws bicker once and a while.I'm interested to hear more from the anti-gay adoption side. This debate is open to all."
1,"I disagree. And I'm actually picking your argument to comment on because it made more sense than most of the others on here. Although you are right in saying each parent gives certain lessons to a child and it's important that that child has different influences, these lessons do not have to come from people of the same gender. Different parents are going to be different no matter their gender. Nurturing doesn't necessarily come from the mother and discipline from the father. Also, say the parents are both men, the children aren't going to be secluded from women in their life. They will have aunts, grandmothers, teachers, family friends, etc that can serve as role models and examples. Also, regardless of whether your arguments make sense or not, it simply isn't shown in any studies done on children raised by gay parents"
2,"Blah. Forget it. I'm not going to beat around the bush. I think a child having two fathers or two mothers is completely unnatural. It's not the way nature intended. Nature did intend for gay people to be around, but not for them to have children."
1,"For what reason? From what I understand, 'marriage' is a social construct. 'Marriage' has not held the same definition since its creation, and it is also different across cultures. In some cultures, men can have four wives. In other cultures, men can have a wife and a girlfriend. And look at this country: until only just recently (the past 50 years or so), it was completely acceptable for husbands to beat their wives. It was a ""personal"" issue, not domestic violence. I suggest reading this article on how traditional marriage has changed over time:http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/260456_marriage.html What I'm trying to get at is: of course homosexual marriages are unnatural. ALL marriages are unnatural. They are constructs of society. And if the society sees it fit, it can change the rules."
1,"1) Nature is non-intelligent, it is incapable of intending anything. Unless of course you're using ""nature"" as a code word for ""God.""2) Just because something is unnatural does not mean it is bad.3) Give up on religion. It's nonsense and you know it."
2,"1. I'm pretty sure nature, not God, did intend for parents to be heterosexual couples. Why else would we reproduce sexually? A mother and a father can make a baby, and thus a mother and father are more equipped to raise a child.2. True, unnatural doesn't mean bad. But does it necessarily mean good?3. You have no right to tell me to denounce my religion. I happen to love my religion and just because you don't believe in a higher being does not mean the whole world must think like you."
2,"Gay marriage's legal benefits would strain taxpayers - While it is true that homosexuals would benefit financial by getting married and receiving the benefits of marriage, that is actually a concern in many people's eyes. The concern is simply that a change in law that allows same-sex marriage will suddenly create a major financial strain on taxpayers that fund marriage benefits. Hundreds of thousands of same-sex marriages would result from any cross-the-board legalization. Given the significance of the benefits provided to married couples, the new strains would be substantial on tax-payers. 
"
1,"1. My point was that the word ""intent"" implies intelligence.2. Irrelevant. The point is not that gay adoption is good, the point is that it's not bad and therefore ok.3. Heh, I know. I just thought I'd throw that out there to see how you'd react. You strike me as too intelligent a person to restrict yourself to an outlook based on nothing but blind faith."
2,"I try my hardest to keep religion out of my debates, unless of course the debate is about the existence of God. =p But other than that, I keep them secular."
1,"I do not think we should label 'religion' as nonsense. Having a moral code is a valuable part of human life, whether or not we define it as religion. But I don't want to change the argument: yes, I agree, just because a religious doctrine may discourage homosexuality, does not mean we must apply that doctrine to a secular government.But please, feel free to add to this argument/write against it. I am encouraging more debate!"
1,Who are you to speak for nature?You have no idea what nature intended. Everything you say is just a blind assumption.
1,"Yeah and they can't conceive children, but they can care for the unwanted children of heterosexuals and in some cases(lesbians) use artificial impregnation techniques just like heterosexuals to conceive a baby. The nature argument is very weak. We as humans bend nature to our will on a daily basis."

1,"Hmmmm. I have put my views out there (made a stand). Maybe it's hard to distinguish when I'm kidding and when I'm being serious. Here's my position on the subject. I think that same sex couples should bypass th liberal right and secure civil unions because the rights afforded to married couples are more important than the word ""married."" Would you rather use the word ""married"" but not have any rights or have the rights but not the word? I know you want both but think about this. Demanding both has resulted in a backlash. The religious right was able to spend less and out organize the gay community in order to get proposition 8 passed. What does that tell you? It tells me that the religious right is deeply offended at the demands made by the gay community. The religious right feels (right or wrong) that the word belongs to them. The gay community has not understood this and has made matters worse by claiming that the religious right is hateful (I know because I've seen the bumper stickers). This is really strange because in poll after poll people seem OK with civil unions. It is as though the gay community is so focused on their goal that they fail to hear what the religious right is saying and when they do hear they (truly or intentionally) misunderstand the words and misrepresent them. The religious right is willing to give the gay community its rights....., but not the word. And all the litigation in the world will never force the majority of the religious right that are currently alive to accept gays as married. If anything, litigation will have an opposite effect.The gay community will eventually win this battle but (if they continue using the current approach) the damage done to the relationship between the two groups will suffer greatly. The gay community is alienating the religious right. I know that the gay community feels that they are the ones being alienated by the religious right. But think about this. How would you feel if some homeless guy came into your home and (not negotiated but) demanded a place to sleep? You have the room. You don't need it all at any given point in time. He will have all kinds of reasons why he should be allowed to sleep there. And if you refuse because it is your home and he shouldn't be making demands, he'll say that you're a hateful person.Don't bother answering because if there's anything I have learned is that you can't change a person's mind with just an argument. Just as you wont change mine. And since you have made it clear that friendship to you means that I have to (not only accept but actually) share your point of view, I accept your request to be enemies. I respect your point of view but I don't share it.One last thing. This is hokey, I know, but it does seem to make me feel better sometimes. Maybe it will make you feel better.God give me the strength to change the things I can,the patience to put it with the things I can't,and the wisdom to know the difference."
1,"Well thanks for the advice straight boy but quite frankly, you don't know your ass from your elbow when it comes to gay rights, what we want or what we deserve as human beings. It's not the word they object to...it's the entire concept. Your analogy of the homeless guy needing a bed to sleep in is about as demented as you are. Joe, I don't give a twaddle if you agree with me on any issue but the one thing you're wrong about is that I ever expected you to share my views nor do I expect that from anyone here or in my life. That's not friendship, that's being a puppet at someone else's whim. Being a friend Joe means that one must choose words carefully when you know that the other person is offended or hurt by the subject matter. You don't make a joke about it, at the very least! Think about what I said on the debate when that person was looking for your retirement from this site. I said what I did because it was wrong and you were my ally even though I was still bruised from the last brouhaha regarding Repubgal.

And another thing....you seem to think you have to accept MY decision to relegate you to the cheap seats and name you an enemy. I don't need your permission to do that and I don't care if you like it or not. And if you're going to quote the Serenity Prayer, why don't you try and get it right. Perhaps the real prayer will mean more than Joe's version of it. It goes like this Boffo:God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can and Wisdom to know the difference.I don't need to feel better but perhaps you do. I can only hope that someday you can comprehend its meaning."

2,"Also known as the “love contract”, the registration of the union of gay couples has been carried out successfully in countries such as Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium and Spain. This would be an avenue for gay couples to declare their union to the world. The practice in countries which implement this system is to allow registered couples to be entitled to joint insurance coverage and to allow them to file for joint tax returns as well as inheritance and tenants’ rights. On the other hand, such a proposal makes no incursions into the sanctity of the institution of marriage itself, thereby proving acceptable to the religious sections of society.

And I'll bring it up again and again until I can get the attention of the powers that be. My vision of how votes should be used also doesn't differ that much from what was perceived as the correct way to use them, whether they be up or down. I don't have to have a complete reason for why someone up or down voted me or anyone else but down voting has been as huge issue for me since I'm the one who got hit. I certainly didn't notice anyone stepping up to say that was wrong before I made the accusatory debate. People can simply run in and out of debates, down vote someone they don't like and up vote those they do and that is not right! It renders the numbers meaningless. I also haven't heard any suggestions made to make the voting better for everyone!Accepted? Yes! Everyone wishes to be accepted on their own terms but if that means I must accept a person when they behave like a complete ass, that's not something I would do.

The only thing I do not accept, across the board, are those that are ill mannered and can say nothing in defense of their own arguments other than to start the name calling or rag on the age routine. I don't wish to have my cake and eat it too and I do not understand why you would accuse me of wanting that. The only other thing I don't understand at all is your very last sentence; BTW, if log on as I down vote, you can down vote again ;) What does that mean?"
2,"""I don't have to have a complete reason for why someone up or down voted me or anyone else but down voting has been as huge issue for me since I'm the one who got hit.

I was hit before but I don't care about the points so it doesn't come naturally to me to think that an adult would care about some lousy points.

It seems that when you feel that you are entitled to something to should just demand it and then you expect to get it. This is what I see happening between the religious right and the gay community. I tell you what I see because it may be of some value to you. I'm standing outside looking in. I have a different point of view. When two blind men try to describe an elephant to each other, and they are standing on the opposite end of the elephant, should one man discard the other man's point of view as wrong or should he consider what the other is telling him in order to come up with a more complete picture? Think about that for a moment because we are on different ends of the elephant and I'm just providing input from where I'm standing in the hopes that it is of some benefit to you. If it isn't, then I'll just STFU because I don't have a dog in this fight."

2," Civil Unions would provide all the ""rights"" that could be somewhat justified by valid argument. Of course it would be ""separate and unequal"" to marriage, because IT IS ... by natural law. Of course the cultural importance of marriage would cause it to be insufficient to homosexual activists, but IF there were gay marriage, then marriage would LOOSE all its cultural importance. A union between homosexuals can NEVER BE more than a Civil Union. 
"
1,"I am a straight Christian and support gay marriage. Why? Simple. Separation of church and state. Gay marriage opposition states that they want to preserve the sanctity of marriage. Let's look at the definition of sanctity: the quality or state of being holy or sacred. That tells me: you cannot preserve the holiness of an act that is governed by the law. That is a violation of church and state. If someone, a Christian or other religious person, wants to get married under the eyes of God in their church, then fine. But it is not our place to impede upon the rights of others that want to be married under the eyes of the law. Or even God, for that matter. I know many gay Christians. It is not our place to judge others or take away from them. Prop 8 is threatening to take away the rights of 18,000 ALREADY MARRIED couples. And all because our religious views clash with their lifestyles. This is not our battle. I support gay marriage, and I support my gay married friends and will continue to fight with them for their equality.Gay marriage does not hurt anyone except those of whom we are stripping away rights. There is no way to prove that gay marriage would impose upon our children in our schools. And besides, kids are going to learn about it anyway, right? Look at MTV right now. You think these kids don't know what's going on?"
1,I applaud your ability to not impose your personal beliefs on others. If only more religious people could be like you.
1,"This is a brilliant statement, and I have to agree with you on this.I'm straight and currently have no defined religion (only one born of personal beliefs that has no name) but I don't see the problem with same sex marriage. For this, I use the same philosophy as in every part of my life: If what someone is doing doesn't hurt anyone else, they can keep doing it. Gay marriage isn't exactly killing anyone, people should put their effort into issues that actually matter instead of denying happy couples their right to be legally married."
1,"Straight people love to pull morality and self righteous dogma from their religions and throw them into this argument but it just doesn't fly anymore. Gay marriage hurts no one in any way whatsoever. From all the studies they've done through the years plus the definitive information that was culled from the brains of dead AIDS patients, it is a fact that there is a center of the brain that is much different than that of the heterosexual, that it can no longer be denied. We're different than you are."
1,"I agree with what you said above, but I am curious, and don't have time to do a literature search (because I am currently doing one of my own for my real job =), do you have the reference to the brain argument? Is it a physiological difference or a genetic difference between hetero- and homosexuals? Is this the case for all of them? At what age does this ""kick in""? I am just trying to learn, it is some thing that I have been interested in, I am not trying to be disrespectful or pick on details. =)"
1,"I'll search for the links to the findings and get back to you. This began several years ago when they began doing full autopsies on HIV/AIDS patients that had succumbed to the disease via cancer, pneumonia and a host of other diseases. It was the first time anyone in the medical field was alerted to that phenomenon. It's both a shame and a blessing that they were able to recognize this for the first time. In the very beginning it was only on men since they were dying in astounding numbers. I'll find as many links as I can and get them to you Kirstie."
1,"Thanks! You don't have to go too crazy and take up too much of your time, it is just that I was really curious as to what science has been done on this topic."
1,That's good...but I find I don't have the time or inclination to look it all up for you as I said I would. If you don't believe it then look it up and refute those of us who know it to be true.
1,"Then if you're different pick a different word. Traditionally marriage has meant a union between a man and a woman. To use the same word for same sex partners dilutes the word and makes it less descriptive. It also pisses of the religious right and makes for great CD fodder ;)You claim to be different but you want to seen as the same. That doesn't make any sense to me. Let us see you as different and accept you for what you are. There's no need to put a requirement forcing us to see you as the same.BTW, claiming that gays are genetetically different and supporting genetic engeneering means that someday some one will want to eradicate the gay gene. It's a two edge sword that cuts both ways. You have to love it ;)Remember, vote twice, vote often ;)"
1,"That is exactly the caliber of response I would expect from a homophobic person. Pick a different word? Different from what? Marriage? I don't care if tradition has heretofore dictated a union between a man and a woman because, guess what? Tradition is on the verge of being expanded to incorporate homosexuals as well and it's high time. We are different from the majority of people that live on this earth insofar as we are only attracted to our own sex but we are also the same in many ways if not every other way. In another post I told you that we have already shown you how we are different and you couldn't or wouldn't accept that. I'm not forcing you or the world to do anything Joe. When the final votes are in and tallied and we win, bit by bit and mile by mile...you and the rest will see you had nothing to fear, nothing to object to and nothing to lose. You and millions of others will see how alike we really are."
1," Children always benefit from two parents (gay or straight) instead of one ""Single-parent mom"" is an all too frequent term. It is costly to children, primarily from the standpoint of having half the support that a child deserves. Married gay couples can provide twice the support that a single parent can provide, and this is always a good thing.
"
1,"Civil unions create a ""separate and thus unequal"" problem Any proposed alternative to marriage itself would be unacceptable as “registered” gay couples would still not enjoy completely equal rights as married heterosexual couples in society. This would also fuel the idea that registered gay couples enjoy an inferior status to married heterosexual couples, thereby giving rise to discrimination all over again.
The cultural importance of ""marriage"" makes civil unions insufficient
Civil unions are frequently unequal to marriage in benefits and rights 
Gay marriage would be met by fewer instances of cross-state discrimination than civil unions

1,No thanks...That would be like biting a sesame seed. I like to be able to see what I bite and it also has to be clean.
2,"OK, whatever. Don't bite me ;)"
1,"That is such a bogus argument Joe. ""You claim to be different but want to be seen as the same."" My God man, take a black man and a white woman, they're not the same but they can now marry (since 1967!). You've seen us as different for eons and that hasn't allowed people to accept us! For all intents and purposes we are very much the same insofar as we all want the same things in life. From you, we can't get that without the fight of a lifetime ensuing. I, for one, couldn't care less if genetic engineering can one day change a gay gene! There'll be less pain in the world if that happened BUT, does anyone have the right to do that? Go work on the autism gene or the Downs syndrome gene or the idiot savant gene...then you will have accomplished something!"
1,I do not understand the rationale behind someone wanting a title that comes from a religion that doesn't agree with your behavior. I'm not stating my opinion. Marriage comes from the bible. No two ways around that. Yes I know people were together before the bible but the marriage and the ceremonies come from the bible. Why is the life partner or any other legal term that allows a homosexual couple to have all the same rights as a heterosexual couple not enough. If you are wondering my opinion yes I believe homosexuality is wrong but I believe alot of things are wrong and people don't have to have a stigma for doing those things. I just don't get the argument.??
1,I don't know if you've noticed but over the last years most churches have been more and more tolerant of gay people and accept them as any other member...just like regular people. Even the civil ceremony calls it a marriage. Pay no attention to what the conversation is between Joe & myself. Most of it doesn't apply...it's a personal thing between us now.
1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah ;)"
1,hahahahahahahahahaha I laughed so hard when I read that just now.
1,"Sorry Joe, I didn't answer you in good time. Yes, the words are there Joe. I am a homosexual woman and you are a heterosexual man. Those words have always existed but it's the straight community who makes us much more different than we really are as people. I've have always shown myself as I really am and I must say that I haven't had too much of a problem with people across the board. You see me Joe...you see me as I really am, for every word I have written and spoken to you is me. I am no different off-line."
2,"I never thought for one moment that you were different in any way shape or form. I have had, and have to this day, gay friends that I never thought were any different. And since I have friends on both sides of the fence, I feel more like someone in the middle of a battle field. I hear both sides and figured I may be able to get one group to bypass the other. However, my solution falls short in that, although it gets homosexuals the rights they're after, it doesn't buy them acceptance. For example, it doesn't get them religious wedding ceremonies from some religions.BTW, a little more about my personal life, if you're interested. When I was a child I loved to play with toy soldiers. I would spend hours setting them up. Once I asked my sister to play and she immediately started a battle. I said, ""What are you doing?"" She said, ""Well...., they're soldiers. They are doing what soldiers do."" I said, ""No! they're supposed to make treaties!"" She said, ""That's boring!"" and left. Later that night my grandmother said that it was time to go to bed and that I had to clear the soldiers off the bed. So I had a small skirmish so that I could go to bed and not have to put away those soldiers that were under the bed. In the morning I continued playing but I don't remember if the survivors had a funeral for those who died the night before or if they managed to resurrect them somehow. I guess that little boy that was always wanting to make peace is still alive and well in me. ;)"

1,"Why would anyone chop you to pieces for putting up a well written rebuttal? Is it me you fear?I've heard of people trying to repress their desire to be with their own sex but I don't know how they could possibly know about their hormones! Many Catholics have tried to do what the church says is right to do...some have failed and some have not, on some level. Look at it this way for a moment. You're straight...you were born that way. 90% of the rest of the world is gay because they were born that way. Could I or anyone convince you, or would you be happy if someone were to try and change you into being gay? I don't think that would be possible, do you?It's also interesting to me that the churches have softened their views of this too. Not the Catholic church but others. Some even ordain gay people into the priesthood or the ministry. That tells me something has changed through the years. Could it be the medical findings of all those poor dead people who succumbed to AIDS that changed their minds? It certainly would mine or at the very least, re-think it. If people are born this way, how can they help what they were born to be?"
1,"wow, repubgal, that sounded almost human ;)I think that you hit the nail right on the head when you said homosexuality doesn't affect you personally. If more religious people took this approach then we would live in a world that had a lot less hate. I think Mark Twain put it best:So much blood has been shed by the Church because of an omission from the Gospel: ""Ye shall be indifferent as to what your neighbor's religion is."" Not merely tolerant of it, but indifferent to it. Divinity is claimed for many religions; but no religion is great enough or divine enough to add that new law to its code.- Mark Twain, a Biography"
1,"Well, great. I had never heard Mark Twain's quote. Put simply, that is exactly what America should aim for. We call ourselves the country of equal opportunity, and slowly we are becoming just that. To each his own."
1,"Who's likely to be a better parent, statistically? Those who HAVE to adopt? Or those who can become pregnant by accident, and be forced to marry and raise a child they resent with a person they barely know?"
1,I don't have the stats on that but logically I should think it would lean toward the adoption...although in my own case I've heard the horror stories of my daughter growing up as an adoptee...it wasn't pretty.
1,"What do you mean by statistically? Are you saying there's statistical evidence? Did you misconstrue my argument? I said if you're able to get pregnant by accident, you're more likely to raise a child you do not want. If you adopt, you're more likely to actually want the child. How many adopted children do you know who resented being adopted? For me, zero. I think your whole argument is on very shaky ground."
1,"Sweetie, I wasn't opposing you...it was Bradf0rd."
2,"I actually know of a few, who maybe don't ""resent"" being adopted, but wished they had their actual parents, and blame a lot of their psychological problems on the fact that they weren't raised by their parents.  Only in THIS time, does this scenario hold so much value. When someone is born by an accident, and then is not wanted, and is raised poorly because of the fact. Why are adoption programs established in the first place? Because there are more people having sex that don't want children, there are more people without the means to have children, but want children, and there are more people out there suffering from bad parenting. This hasn't always been the case, see what I've said to Kukla.  The chances of ""accidentally"" having children, and the chances of not being able to care for the child, have to be higher now than any other time in history, partly due to the fact that there are just more people in general out there at this moment than any other specific time in history. If the failure rate is higher now than ever, and the number of gays raising children are higher than ever too, logically, the percent of failure has to effect the lower number, the gay adopters, more than the people having the children by accident. Also, something to conceder is, why are they failing? If it's because of the income, look at the percent of failure with a mother and father in the same income bracket than the adopter's, you will find that there is a wide gap. Most accidental births, I'm sure, are well taken care of despite the fact that they weren't planned, more often in a higher income bracket than a lower. The people with a low income will fail, whereas the people in the higher one, even though it's accidental, will be taken care of just as well as ones raised by adopters, because they are given money, and already have the money to do so. In all of time, there have been more straight couples with money and children than gay couples with money and children... think about it. Statistically speaking, the straight people may have failed more people over the coarse of history, but that doesn't mean that they haven't also raised more children successfully too."
2,"Gay marriage is unacceptable because it is not private. If two people choose to engage in this behavior behind closed doors, society should remain agnostic.  However, when this behavior (like other aberrant behaviors), is championed as normal, natural, and a matter of ""freedom"" (as opposed to license), society has an obligation to protect children during their formative years and denounce these acts.

1,"Unless I am misunderstanding you, how can an infant feel alienated if he/he is brought up by straight people? The child has no idea that one of the parents are gay! In 1967, all adoptions and all information was sealed...forever!Even if it weren't there is nothing to say the mother was telling the truth about herself or the father of the child! No one checked these things.And where, may I ask, you're getting your statistics from?"
1,"I say, keep gay marriage OUT of religion. HOWEVER, allow it as a legal form of marriage. Shouldn't gay people be allowed to be happy(or gay...lol) as well."

Studies are showing that some people are born gay and if you want to marry your lover who is anyone else to say that they should not be wed?Is seeing 2 guys or gals with rings on their fingers really that obscene? What is the difference between seeing a married gay couple and a gay couple? Is there really that huge of a difference? I do not believe so.
1,What I love is we have 4 people saying it hurts them but all 4 don't have the guts to say how. Come on. If it hurts you personally.. HOW? Have some testicular fortitude and explain your pain.
1,"I hope you are not lumping in with those 4. I'm not hurt by it personally. I'm an outsider looking in and providing input as to what it looks like from where I'm standing and suggesting a way forward. Bypass the religious right, forget the word ""marriage"" and focus on obtaining your rights through civil unions.Gays should embrace their difference and chose to create a word that elevates gay unions above the divorce wrought hetero marriages.The religious right thinks the word belongs to them. They're going to fight for it. Proposition 8 is indicative of how hard they are willing to fight. They are willing to go to the mat. They are not going to roll over. This battle is going to slow the gay community as they attempt to gain their rights. They need a fast track to their rights. Go around the religious right. Forget the word, get your rights now! Focus on what is truly important like being by your partner in his/her time of need if (God forbid) they are ever in the hospital. You should have that right now. You shouldn't have to wait while you argue over a silly word."
1,"Hasn't it become obvious to you as yet that one ""silly"" word is NOT silly at all to gay people? We wish it to mean exactly what the word 'Marriage' connotes and carries with it. It's a real simple thing but straight people think they are more than we are and that's why they want a copyright on the word."
1,"You are making an assumption and then you act on your assumption by making an accusation.Assumption: straight people think they are more than we are Accusation: that's why they want a copyright on the word.My philosophy is to try and verify my assumptions before acting on them. That usually goes a long way towards saving face later on if the assumption proves to be wrong.Your argument is also based on emotion and it thus tries to manipulate the reader's feelings. This is done by calling one group bad; the straight people. You do do this by saying that ""straight people think they are more than we are."" You then call the other group good; the gay people. You do this by saying ""We wish it to mean exactly what the word 'Marriage' connotes and carries with it.""I prefer arguments that are based on data and let the reader decide. There is no way to prove that gays wish marriage to mean exactly what it connotes and carries with it. There is also no way to prove that straight people think they are more than gays. Nor is there a way to prove that that's why they want a copyright on the word."
1,"Now, my view on the topic itself. I have three points:Point one: I am a purist and I want the word 'marriage' to mean exactly what those who invented the word years ago defined it to be, ""A civil union between a man and a woman."" I don't want to change the meaning of the word to ""The loving union between two individuals."" Point two: Just because someone wants something doesn't mean that they are entitled to it. So, no matter how noble gays may be, no matter how important the word is to them, they are not entitled to it.Point three: Gays started this ""war"" by trying to take something they feel strongly about but are not necessarily entitled to. Straights responded like anyone who has had someone try to take something away that doesn't necessarily belonged to them. Gays want to force straights to share the word. But trying to force someone into doing something they don't want usually results in them resisting with equal or greater force.I thus propose that gays create a new word and stop this ""war."""
1,"""Point one: I am a purist and I want the word 'marriage' to mean exactly what those who invented the word years ago defined it to be, ""A civil union between a man and a woman."" I don't want to change the meaning of the word to ""The loving union between two individuals.""If a Civil Union was what they defined Marriage to be then what? You now have both of the words and/or statements by which the union is known. Does this mean we can have neither? If, as you state, we are not entitled to it then what shall people who wish to be married and enjoy a Civil Union be called? And why should it have to change? All any gay couple wishes to have are the things that are already defined by these words. If you change it, then you must define it. Then the ball starts to roll again in the direction of not being equal to Heterosexual people...but we are in all ways but one.I, for one, am not in a war of any kind. I use logic and yes, I do use emotion along with logic in order to get some points across. Of course I can agree on the larger picture of people wanting something they are not entitled to but who decides we are not in this case? Straight people! Is this in any way just? I don't think it is and I wouldn't think so if the tables were turned."
2,"""Gays started this ""war"" by trying to take something they feel strongly about but are not necessarily entitled to.""That's the point. They are entitled to it which is why attempted bans of gay marriage will always fail because it flys in the face of equal protection under the law as stated in the recent Iowa Supreme Court decision."

1,"Gays ARE entitled to equal protection under the law.Gays ARE entitled to have the same rights as heterosexual married couples.Gays ARE NOT entitled to the word ""marriage!""If gays feel that they need the word in order to be accepted, then they are misguided because you can't legislate acceptance.

1,"Do you even have a clue about the history of marriage? Seriously.Marriage has meant plenty of things over the millenia. It's not about a word, it's about a right. There were those who said blacks couldn't marry whites once upon a time. The same rhetoric was used against them. Gays are entitled to the word marriage just like anyone else because no one owns that word and any connotation that you ascribe to that word has a historical context that has changed over time and will change more over time. Separate is not equal."
1,"Historically, marriage has meant a union between a man and a woman. If it has ever meant anything other than that, then I would like to see that proof.When racists said that a black person could not marry a white person, they lost in the courts because the historical definition has been ""a union between a man and a woman"" not ""a union between a man and a woman of the same race.""Racists did not try to claim ownership of the word. The racists tried to change the definition of the word and lost. As they should have.Now a new group wants to change the definition of the word once again and they should lose that battle but they should win the battle to get their rights."
1,"Historically marriage is a property arrangement wherein a man takes possession of a woman. This has led to forced marriages and polygamy being the norm for thousands of years up to this day in many parts of the world. What you call marriage is a western idea. Western society has changed the definition of marriage a lot to suit their society just like any society does. Considering womena's sufferge wasn't that long ago as far as history is concerned it's suprising that you think marriage has always been a equal union. No, actually it's naive.On your point about blacks: They had to be allowed equal protection under the law before that could happen. Google: Jim Crow.The racist were upholding the traditional norm that blacks were subhuman and shouldn't marry whites. You just don't seem to get it. People thought marriage didn't include them at the time either. You are looking at the whole thing backwards. The word is changed constantly through history and those against the change are always on the wrong side of it."
1,"I never said anything about marriage traditionally being an equal union. I said that it was a union between a man and a woman and that part has remained constant. But I like the way you twisted my words in order to call me naive.Now you insinuate that heterosexuals consider homosexuals as subhumans and thus don't want them to marry. That's an assumption. You're assuming to know ""the real reason"" why some heterosexuals don't want to allow homosexuals to use the word marriage. Heterosexuals say that the reason they don't want gays to marry is because marriage has traditionally been a union between a man and a woman. You seem to be calling these heterosexuals liars and racists who consider gays to be subhuman.So, to recap, your argument is based on discrediting me by calling me naive and appealing to the reader's emotions by insinuating that heterosexuals are racists. I tend to find these types of arguments as weak. I mean, name calling and trying to manipulate people's emotions instead of letting your argument stand alone on its merit is weak.I understand your argument that the word marriage has changed in definition over time and thus there's a precedence for changing it once again. But the changes you site are minor and the underlying definition [the foundation, if you will] has never changed. It has always been between a man and a woman.BTW, you may want to reply here.http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                       What_are_some_of_the_ramification_of_gay_marriage or not ;)"
1,"As far as your ""separate is not equal"" statement, it simply does not apply to this situation. That statement applied to the situation between blacks and whites. One example (for illustrations purposes) is schooling. The idea was that blacks would have their own schools and whites would have their own school. But since at that time whites were more affluent than blacks, their children were able to enjoy a higher level of education.In the current situation heterosexual couples are not necessarily more affluent than gays. There's no reason to assume that a heterosexual union would be better than a homosexual union. There's also no reason to assume that by calling a homosexual union a ""marriage"" that they will receive a ""higher level"" of benefits than if they just called it a civil union. Therefore, the statement ""separate but equal"" does not apply."
1,"I don't know if you've been reading all of my arguments on this topic but what I'm proposing is for the government to stop using the word ""marriage"" and replace it with the words ""civil union"" and have those 2 words apply to heterosexual and homosexual unions. This would give homosexual unions the same rights as heterosexual unions.However, If the government were to take this advice, the churches would still be able to deny to perform homosexual wedding ceremonies. In this case gays don't miss out on any ""rights"" because a wedding ceremony [performed by a representative of a given religion] is not a right.If the government were to use the word ""marriage"" for homosexual unions, then would churches be required to perform homosexual wedding ceremonies? If so, wouldn't this mean that the government is telling the church what it can and cannot do? Is it a good idea for the government to get into the ""business"" of religion? And if the churches are forced to perform homosexual weddings, would gay couples automatically be accepted by the congregation?"
2,"Having said all of that, I know exactly how you feel because I too want something that I'm not entitled to and the courts keep on deying me.So my arguments to you are like therapy to me because if I can create a well thought out argument against gay marriage, then I can use a similar argument to justify the court's decision to myself and this in turn eases the pain and resentment and anger that is within me.So don't think too harshly of me. We're all in this together. We all have issues. ;)"
1,"Yes, Joe! We are all in this together and I'm glad you made that statement! I don't think harshly of you when you make an honest and well thought out rebuttal. I only think that way when you start with your other type of debate or arguments!You say you are also fighting the courts on something you say you're not entitled to. I don't know what that may be but you must keep fighting for a reason. We, too, fight for a reason. We fight for equality in all things because we are also viable human beings who deserve to be treated as such. ;-)"
1,"Gayness is as natural as sex and food.Treating people worse because of them being gay is like treating black or Asian or Indian people worse than others.Except I've actually seen a black person change his colour (Michael Jackson), but I've never heard of a real story where a gay guy became straight (and not asexual or faking it trough whole life)."

2,"Nobody is born gay, although they might become gay because one of their parents is gay and they look up to them."
1,That is as far from the truth as one can get! There are no statistics that show that your take on this is true.
1,"In fact there is evidence proving that homosexuality is genetic. At this point people are just willfully denying this fact because it doesn't fit into their world view. If homosexuals are born that way, then that means God created homosexuals. This is unacceptable to most fundamentalists, so they merely close their eyes, cover their ears and scream ""LALALALALA"" whenever someone points out the fact that they have been proven wrong."
2,"NO! You're making an assumption as to why people are opposed to same sex marriage! Show me the data proving that ""people are just willfully denying this fact because it doesn't fit into their world view."" This is part of the problem. People are going off half cocked making assumption all over the place..... and they are not even constructive assumptions. If the other side doesn't agree with you, just malign them and call them names. The assumption is that there's one reason and only one reason why the religious right is against same sex marriage; they're bigots. Come on, you're smarter than that! The world is not black and white. There are shades in between. That's me and whole lot of other people."
1,"Well Joe, give me one non-religious reason why people are opposed to same sex marriage. Just one. I try to be as fair as possible in most of my arguments and usually give people the benefit of the doubt. Here though, I feel that bigotry or ignorance are the only reasons to oppose this issue. People don't choose to be gay, that is a fact. By taking away rights from people for reasons beyond their control you are discriminating against them. Plain and simple. The only difference between this and racism is that this is socially acceptable. Why? Because in some obscure passage of the Bible it says homosexuality is wrong. It also says it's okay to beat your slave to death as long as it takes a while for them to die.I cannot be silent about my beliefs any more then those fighting for civil rights in previous generations could. There is no legitimate reason for denying happiness to another person if you are unaffected by it."
1,"andSoccer16,First of all. I would like to say that you have challenged me and bested me and I have acknolwedged it and up voted you for it. If you're truly a teen, then you're light years ahead from when I was a teen because it has taken me this long to get to this stage. It may have been a backwards journey for me but I like to think otherwise.Your question was an interesting challenge to say the least. I wrestled with it until my wife got home and helped me see the light. She helped me see what I've been feeling but unable to put into words.Please bear with me, I'm a little drunk. Which is not entirely fair because you are not allowed to drink and probably in your prime.A non- religious reason why people are opposed to same sex marriage (by J.C.)Birds of a feather flock together.I wish I could make my argument more...... serious.... more..... adult like. It's just human nature.Here read this:http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/mar/09/genetics.medicalresearch and this:http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/28/5/283 and this:http://milehive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=1176&Itemid;=36 The bottom line:Gays want to be accepted into a club that doesn't want them and they are getting militant about it.Why is that? Probably because people want what they can't have and despise what they do have. Groucho Marx once said:""PLEASE ACCEPT MY RESIGNATION. I DON'T WANT TO BELONG TO ANY CLUB THAT WILL ACCEPT PEOPLE LIKE ME AS A MEMBER"". This is also why the ""hair"" industry makes lots of money. Women with straight hair want curly hair and women with curly hair want staight hair.It's just human nature. Not bigotry or ignorance, it's just human nature.Now, I have to go pee.C-ya ;)"
1,"Joe, I appreciate you compliments and I hope you know that I really do appreciate a lot of your ideas. As for this argument, you present a very unique perspective. Allow me to respond though.Although it is true that people often want what they can't have, this does not always mean that their demands are unreasonable. Allow me to first use the example of the American Revolution. You will often hear people say, ""we defeated British tyranny over us etc..."" What a lot of people don't realize is that we had it pretty good under the British. We had extremely low taxes, protection from others, and a reliable trading partner. Now a lot of stuff happened but the condensed version is, we wanted more: ""Taxation w/out representation"" and the like. So we had it pretty good already, but we wanted something more: liberty, inalienable rights, representative government. These are the foundations of our society today, but had we accepted what was going on at the time they may never have come to fruition.Another example would be woman's suffrage. The common idea at the time (or at least rationalization) was that women would vote the same as their husbands so their right to vote was irrelevant. This idea seems archaic to us today, but back then it was the accepted norm. Progress eventually won out and woman gained the right that is most necessary to a democracy: the right to vote.In both of these cases we can see how the status quo seems fine to a large number of people because it is what they are used to. Others though, see that there is an injustice occurring, and step up to fix it. I believe this explains why so many oppose gay marriage more than anything else. It is what has always been, why change it. I know you are a conservative, so know that I mean no offense when I say that conservative viewpoints have stood in the way of positive change throughout history. It is not bigotry that kept allowed slavery to continue (although that played a role) it is inaction and complacency.Now we see the same scenario repeated. A group has been denied certain rights and now they are asking for them. You used the word militant, and I have to disagree with its connotations. African Americans were called militant when they demanded civil rights during the 60's, were they just being greedy? Or were they standing up and demanding that they be given what was promised to them as children: that all men are created equal, no different from our founding fathers who stood up during the revolution and demanded their rights. No different then now, where a group of people want to have their love recognized under the law. They want to be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness. I think that your right on one count, that is human nature. It is human nature to want acceptance, and to want equality, and to want a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted.I hope you see why I am upset at those people who prevent these people from the happiness they seek, and why I call them bigots. There crime is all too common, an inability to put yourself in your neighbors shoes. An inability to recognize the humanity of others. An inability to empathize with their suffering in a society that does not fully accept them."
2,"The specific thing you requested was for me to give you a legitimate reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion. I did that. You said that, ""I feel that bigotry or ignorance are the only reasons to oppose this issue."" I thought I gave a perfect example where this was not the case. Some people just don't want to be around other people. That does not make them a bigot nor does it make them ignorant. Not granting gays the word marriage but granting them the same rights does not make one a bigot nor does it make one ignorant nor does it hurt the gay community.You say that same but separate is not good enough as though as soon gays are allowed to marry the bigots will suddenly see the errors of their ways. That's not going to happen. All the litigation in the world will never force a bigot to accept you. He will just look at you in the eye, turn around, and roll his eyes.My argument does not call people names. Your argument calls anyone opposed to gay marriage a bigot or ignorant. The side you're on is considered liberal. The side I'm on is seen as conservative. I don't categorize my argument as conservative because it takes a middle of the road approach. Take a little (your rights) give a little (leave the word behind). This is what I call negotiation. The side you're on is not interested in negotiation and is seen as militant; it's a ""my way or the highway"" approach and then your side acts surprised when they encounter resistance.The side your on wants people to put themselves in their shoes but they are not willing to put themselves in the shoes of the other side.The side I'm on is seen as being based on religion. I don't categorize my argument as being based on religion because my argument does not invoke religion. It invokes human nature. My argument is also constructive in that it alienates a smaller group on the religious right. It is pragmatic and rational in that it gets gays their rights sooner and all they are leaving on the table is just a word.People can want all they want. I never said it was unreasonable. I just think that it is not practical at this point in time as evidence by proposition 8. I have said that gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost? Take your time, regroup, do a ""lessons learned"" analysis of what went wrong and why and then try again later.People can want all they want but that does not mean that they are entitled to it or that they deserve it or that they have a right to it.The status quo does not seem right to me. Otherwise I would never have suggested to bypass them. I saw an injustice occurring and I tried to think of a pragmatic approach towards getting what I consider important and leaving behind what I don't consider important in the shortest amount of time. That was my contribution. That was my way of stepping up to the plate and trying to fix things and I got slammed. This explains why others that have tried to help the gay community but encountered the negative feed back have stopped supporting gay marriage more than anything else. What allowed slavery to continue was not inaction and complacency. People were working towards fixing it. What allowed slavery to continue for as long as it did is that it takes time to change the world. The gay community is not asking for certain rights, it is demanding them. The gay community is not interested in negotiating and this stance is alienating a lot of potential allies. The gay community is taking an in your face approach and are surprised when the other side responds in kind.The group that followed Martin Luther King were not militant. The Black Panthers were.The gays that are peacefully trying to advance their agenda are not militant. The ones vandalizing churches are.The gay community wants to portray itself as being the new civil rights fighters of our generation. The black community finds this highly offensive. What is the worst a gay man has had to openly endure in the last 10 years and compare that to what a black man had to endure during the 60's. There's no comparison. The gay community as the new civil rights fighters of our generation is an exaggeration; it is a tactic meant to get them what they want, nothing else.No one promised gays the right to marriage. They can have their love legally recognized under a different name and not suffer because of it. They can be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness without the having the word marriage. The word marriage will not magically get them to be acceptance nor get them a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted. They have to find happiness within themselves. No one can grant it to them so no one can deny it to them.I hope you see why I am upset at those hypocritical gays that say ""empathize with our suffering in a society that does not fully accept us"" and then turn around and vandalize churches. Now that is a real crime and it is not very accepting of the other side. I don't think they are empathizing with the other side, do you? I guess they forgot to put on their neighbors shoes. Do you think that when gays call the other side hateful and bigot and ignorant that they are able to see the humanity of the other side? Does maligning someone help you solve your differences or does it hinder? And if it hinders, why do it. What value is there in calling someone a bigot? It is a great tactic. The Nazis used it with great success to get people to think that it was OK to kill Jews because, after all, Jews were vermin. You see?"
1,"Okay, let me first make it clear that I never condoned violent action as a way to solve the problem. Gandhi and MLK Jr. are some of my heroes because they affected change in the most peaceful ways possible. What I also liked about them is they both recognized injustice and stood up to it without compromise. Gandhi wanted the British out of India and did not compromise on this issue. Martin Luther King wanted equal rights for African-Americans and did not compromise. There is a big difference between not wanting to compromise, and being narrow minded. You say ""Some people just don't want to be around other people."" This to me is a type of discrimination. If I told you, I am not bigoted, I just don't want to be around Mexicans, you would be appalled.Here is the definition of a bigot in wikipedia:A bigot is a person who is intolerant of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her ownLooking at this definition you can see clearly that not wanting to be around people who choose to be homosexual is bigotry. But that is irrelevant because no one is forcing people to be around homosexuals. This is what I don't understand about your argument. If homosexuals get married does that mean suddenly they are going to suddenly show up at your door, and when you refuse them say ""Hey, you have to let us in, we're legally married now."" That is ridiculous.Of course legalizing gay marriage will not automatically get rid of bigots, I never said that and I don't believe it. When slavery was abolished, did it get rid of racism? When woman's suffrage was granted, did it get rid of sexism? No! But in the long run it helped a lot. Can you imagine anyone believing either of these issues as having two reasonable sides today? The bigots will not change their mind, but their children will be raised in a society that is more accepting, and hopefully this will have a large affect for future generations.Being intolerant of bigotry cannot be called bigotry.I agree that maybe gay marriage will not come to fruition in the immediate future, but that does not mean that people should stop fighting for what they believe in. Martain Luther King demanded equal rights for African-Americans. Feminists demanded equal rights for women. Asking nicely, ""can we please get married, if it isn't to much of a problem for you?"" Of course what blacks suffered through in the pre-civil rights era was terrible. That does not lessen what homosexuals are going through right now. I know from seeing it at my school how much homosexuals are mistreated and outcast. This is socially acceptable, and it shouldn't be. Progress will probably be attained in smaller steps but only if people continue to fight for their rights. Obama is the perfect example of this: in order to win the presidency he had to support civil unions but not gay marriage. Lucky for me, I'm not a politician. I don't have to temper my views with the current public will. I can say what I truly believe. If a compromise were reached in the federal government that extended rights to homosexuals through civil unions I would be in favor of that, but after it was passed I would go right back to fighting for marriage. Homosexuals even lost the ability to adopt in Arkansas because they can't marry or even have civil unions:http://outtheotherear.wordpress.com/2008/08/26/spotlight-arkansas-gay-adoption/ I also have a problem with you comparing the Homosexuals to the Nazis. First, the Nazis killed homosexuals, because they thought they were, to use your word, ""vermin."" What the homosexuals are not doing is killing or hurting others in any way by demanding marriage. By denying them marriage, other people are hurting homosexuals. So who is more like the Nazi's now? Don't you think its justified to loathe your oppressors? This does not mean violence, as I said earlier I am against violence.Speaking of Bigotry though, I want you to see what homosexuals have to put up with:http://www.godhatesfags.com/Is it unfair for me to call them bigots, or am I being narrow minded?Finally I would like to respond to this comment you made:I have said that gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost?And I can only respond with this quote:""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."" -Edmund Burke"
1,"So by your definition everyone is a bigot, including yourself, because I can probably come up with a group of people that you don't want to be around.However, a closer look at the definition of the bigot will clearly show that it is possible for a person to not want to be around a group of people for reasons other than intolerance of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her own. For example, I do not want to be around people that don't speak my language because I would rather be something else rather than trying to make myself be understood or trying to understand what they were saying. And if we are just supposed to be sitting there saying nothing, I would still rather be something else.BTW, I think that it is convenient that:""Being intolerant of bigotry cannot be called bigotry."""

2,"If you lost the ability to adopt in Arkansas because you can't marry or even have civil unions there, then move to a gay friendly state. But under no circumstance take this advice to mean that you should stop fighting for marriage."
1,"I love sarcasm ;)Everyone has their own reality. When I came to this country I had a choice. I could keep my language my culture and all of that crap or I could assimilate, leave all of that behind and live the good life. Guess which I chose? Life is full of choices. There's give and take. People that only take...... make me feel uneasy.The gay community is uncompromising when it comes to this issue of marriage.check this out:http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                       Is_it_better_to_offend_than_allow_yourself_to_be_placed_in_an_uncompromising Maybe we should continue over there since it's getting crowded over here."
2,"Soccer, you're floundering. lets keep it short and sweet.The specific thing you requested from me was to give you a legitimate reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion. I did that. You still claim that every person that is opposed to gay marriage is a bigot (period). if you don't think that my reason is legitimate, then say so and we'll debate that.I never said that people should stop fighting for their rights. I said that they should take the high road, which is a slower, longer road. Take the Gandhi road, the Martin Luther king road instead of the low road that may get you there faster. Don't take the ""If you are against us you are "" road. The low road is a tactic used to get you there faster.If I recall correctly, I did not compare homosexuals to Nazis. I said that the tactics being used are the same tactics that the Nazis used. This tactic can be used for good. The tactic itself is not evil. The gay movement is not the first to use that tactic. I don't like the tactic.I think that calling everyone who is opposed to gay marriage a bigot is unfair and narrow minded.When I said, ""gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost?"" What I mean is, That the ends do not justify the means. Calling people a bigot in order to get your way is uncalled for.I've told you in the past when I have up voted you and why. This is the first time I have ever down voted someone. But I respect you enough to explain why I'm doing it. I'm down voting you for insisting that everyone who is opposed to gay marriage is a bigot even after I have given you one reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion and you did chose not to respond to that. Your position implies to me that the ends justify the means. I think you can do better than that.no hard feelings. Peace out ;)"
1,"I think I may have deserved the downvote because I did not organize my last argument very effectively. Instead of getting into a long draw out thing this time, I am going to go back to my original intention.What I was referring to as bigotry was ignoring certain facts. In this case I was talking about JakeJ, because he repeatedly claimed that homosexuality was a choice, and I repeatedly showed him the proof that it wasn't. JakeJ, and most other people opposed to gay marriage don't use your argument but instead make baseless claims (i.e. kids can be turned gay, or gay parents can't raise children). When these things have been proven scientifically, continuing to use the same arguments is dishonest. I know that, in probably less then 50 years, the people who opposed allowing gays their rights will be considered bigots, for better or worse, and so I therefore stand by my statements."
2,"OK, so now you're saying that you follow the crowd instead of making up your own mind.Think about this. In any given argument, to use absolutes is usually wrong. To say that ""everyone who opposes gay marriage is a bigot"" is wrong. To say that ""everyone else says that everyone who opposes gay marriage is a bigot so it must be true"" is wrong. Are you saying that it is physically impossible for someone to be against gay marriage for some reason other than being a bigot?Think about this. If it were a true statement that anyone who doesn't want to be around a specific group is a bigot, then why doesn't the definition of the word say that? Could it be that there are plenty of other reasons for people not to want to be around a specific group? What if you were shy and only wanted to hang around your own kind? What if you were deaf and only wanted to hang around deaf people? What if people with tinnitus wanted to be called deaf and deaf people were opposed, would they be bigots?"
1,"I just spent the last five minutes looking through my arguments seeing if I could find where I said ""everyone who opposes gay marriage is a bigot"" and guess what? I wasted my time! Don't put things in quotes as if I said them when I clearly didn't. If you want to use quotes copy and paste, I have written plenty of stuff, I'm sure you can find something that will go to prove your point.If I am understanding you correctly, here is your argument: People are not being bigoted just because they don't want to be around people. Am I right so far? Because I agree with this part. Next you say: some people who don't want gays to get married only because they don't want to be around them. Is this correct? Because I think you might be right that this could be some peoples reasons. No one is asking them to hang out with homosexuals, or even talk to them so I don't understand their rationale, but at least it's an explanation. So so far we agree.Now here's where your logic decides to jump off a cliff into a pile of razor blades after having swallowed a gallon of vodka and three bottles of sleeping pills: People are not being bigoted, or intolerant when they allow their discomfort of being around gays to affect their decisions as to whether gays should be allowed to get married. Is this the basic point your making? If not ignore the rest of the argument and clarify your position, but if so keep reading. Denying others rights because you don't like their lifestyle is intolerant and bigoted. I may not like people with your opinions but I would never try to take away your right to voice them. Here is where the difference lies. You are allowed to be uncomfortable with how people live. I admit, I would be pretty uncomfortable around a man who wore nothing but a thong all day, but I wouldn't take away his rights. I could decide not to hang out with the thong-man. I might purposefully avoid him, but I would not take away his rights or the rights of all the thong-men in the entire state. Why? Because I know that if my lifestyle was not the popular or accepted one then I would not want people trampling on my rights.Your metaphor is an inaccurate one for two reasons: A) there is no logic in a groups wanting to change the name of their condition; and (this is the important one) B) homosexuals aren't forcing anything on people, merely asking for the same rights as afforded to others. A change in the name of your condition does not afford you more rights. (I considered including a C that said your an idiot but I didn't think that would add anything to my argument)"
1,"OK, sorry about the misquote, It was not intentional.I liked your cliff, razor blade thing. ;)I stopped reading after the 3rd paragraph because that is not what I'm saying. I think that we are talking past each other.Here's what I'm saying:if a straight person said he wanted a kid who shares his same reality and perspective, that marriage is only between a man and a woman, then that person would be classified a bigot. And it's really a shame because the only thing that matters is the rights associated with marriage, not the word marriage. If the gay community took their rights and left the word, then there would be peace.Check this debate out.http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                       Are_deaf_people_bigots_against_hearing_people We should probably continue over there because this is getting way too crowded."

2,"Most children look up to their parents, but that's because the parents are taller ;)Also, I find it hard to believe that someone would chose to be gay. I mean, that's a hard life to live."
1,"HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GOING TO DENY THE FACTS!!!Jake, at this point you are being willfully ignorant. I have shown you scientific explanations for homosexuality on numerous occasions in numerous debates. You have yet to respond to a single one. Is it because you know I'm right? Is it because you are in denial? For God's sake (and yes I use that phrase ironically) tell me what reasons you have for believing that A) ""nobody is born gay"" and B) they only become gay because their parents are gay?Also you are implying being gay is wrong...by whose definition and why? Just answer me once Jake. Enlighten me with the reasons that you believe surpass science and logic. Why do you feel discrimination is okay? Have you ever even met a homosexual?"

1,"Jake said:It hurts families, the more gay marriage the less families there will be, children need a mother and a father to look up to.Good job voting that idiotic statement down everyone. I don't think the source of that idea has been explored enough though. And personally, I believe in humilating idiotic statements as a form of social punishment, so here goes. Hopefully you read this Jake.gay marriage = less families only if you believe that people would choose to be gay instead of heterosexual.that is, you jake, think that someone who is otherwise attracted to the opposite sex, would have had kids and raised them, will now move in with someone of the same sex and not have kids.ignoring for a moment that this isn't all together bad since there are too many people. what kind of person would think that may be the case?I know for myself, being very comfortable in my heterosexuality, I would not magically turn gay because a law was passed. do you fear, jake, that you may magically turn gay if a law were passed?because that is really the only reason for your statement. if you actually think about what your wrote, I mean, that's the only possible end conclusion.and if you do stand behind that statement jake, I have to ask myself, what kind of person would have such a ridiculous fear.and I can only think of one kind jake. a closet gay person.so if you want to come out, which I'm assuming from your statement deep down you do, then this is the place for it. There seems to be a lot of open people here, and at least one very popular openly gay member.it's okay jake, be brave.and if you do choose to not come out, that's okay, I understand it's a cold hard world out there for a gay person. but know this at least. whatever you do, whatever you say, no matter how much you deny it, I at least will always know that, you jake, are gay. and I accept that."
2,"No, I'm not gay. I am assuming that was supposed to be an insult, yet you have been defending it. Its like you are saying ""protect the gays give them rights,"" then you you turn around and say ""hey i don't like you, i will humiliate you by saying that your gay"" -you just contradicted yourself!"
1,"Whatever Jake, it's very easy to lie and be a bigot and a fundie, especially over internet.Approximately 80% of homophobes are gay and I'm SURE the rest have their issues too, mostly connected with sexuality.If you think that a person would turn gay if he was allowed to, than you must be thinking of a person who is attracted to men, you are referring to a GAY person and a GAY person turning GAY ISN'T VERY DRAMATIC, NOW IS IT?!An intelligent straight person would never like it to not allow gays to marry and adopt children.If gays can marry and adopt that means that baby making isn't a very big deal since the gays are going to raise them. (If you are a religions fundie, that means you can be more logically for pro-life if you are pro-gay-marriage)Plus, if there are so many women left alone, or rather lonely, than you can have a lot of sex.Oh, and by the way, straight men like sex with women (right guys? :)), so they couldn't mind.The only people who could POSSIBLY mind gays are gay people who don't want to be gay(...and raise kids and miss all the coitus..., but they don't like it anyway) and women who fall in love with gays. As some comedian woman says: ""I'm a fag-hag, but now I think about my wishing in youth about being surrounded by handsome men, I should have been more specific."""
2,"No, I'm not gay. ""The only people who could POSSIBLY mind gays are gay people who don't want to be gay"" that is false, what about the other 20% you mentioned?"
2,"Responses are much more effective when you do more than just ridicule the poster. I know a lot of people who decide to be gay, and I know even more people who think they are gay because they are musically inclined or sensitive and they are told their whole life that they are ""closet gays."" I find it incredibly prejudice to think that everyone who doesn't like beer and football or somehow misses the masculine bar is gay, and I think that IS one of the big problems with the publicity that homosexuality is making. I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with me, but I think there is a baseline group of gay people and then a huge amount of other people who are gay because of peer pressure, insecurity, and/or because it's the popular thing to be right now.I know, incoming down votes. Didn't say anyone had to agree, I just think it's stupid to tell someone else about their sexuality.And please don't respond with ""studies prove,"" because as I've already said, they don't."
1,"The question attempts to disguise in a kinder and gentler way a very ugly assertion - homosexual individuals are unfit to parent. That assertion has little or nothing to do with children and everything to do with unsubstantiated prejudice and brutal politics. Those who ask it believe homosexuals to be somehow sub-human or dysfunctional in their abilities and lesser in value to the heterosexual and then set out to find trivialities to support their prejudices. The problem with this thinking is its generalities which cannot fit every single specific case - homosexual OR heterosexual. It is an elementary thing to show that any single heterosexual can be every bit as dysfunctional in parenting as any single homosexual. I believe it also elementary to show that any single heterosexual couple or group to be every bit as dysfunctional in parenting as any single homosexual couple or group. Of course, the opposite of this is also likely true: there are very capable heterosexual  AND homosexual couples or groups when it comes to parenting.What matters most in a parent-child relationship isn't who the parent has sexual relations with but whether or not there is mutual love and support and healthy relations between parent and child. Is the parent an adequate guardian? Are the child's emotional needs fulfilled? If one's concern is with the child, then ask questions regarding the child's state of happiness, not whether or not the parent is sleeping with who you believe they ought to be sleeping with. One's true focus is revealed in the question itself.Those who attempt to make a very ugly value statement about homosexuals without, in their minds, being obvious about it wish there to be some truth to their generalities and ""on averages"". A human being is not a generality. A human being is an average. A human being is not a label, or class, or category. A human being is a specific with truths applicable to them and them alone. What is true of one is not necessarily true of another unless that truth has been substantiated in close examination. The mean-spirited will find something true of one or a few individuals and then wash thousands with that isolated truth to advance their agenda of meanness. Those genuinely interested in the truth will seek fact and apply whatever truth can be extracted from those facts to those examined and they alone. To apply those truths in general ways to those you perceive to be members of a class can only be a tentative exercise. Substantiation is required before one can justify acting on what one believes to be true.Why not ask such generalities as - are children with heterosexual parents at a disadvantage? The question as stated is unanswerable. Some children are and will be, some will not. It depends as much on the qualities of the child as it does on the qualities of the parent or parents. Are heterosexual parents at a disadvantage with same-sex children? Some believe they are, others do not. Again, it depends on the qualities of parent(s) and child. Are homosexual parents at a disadvantage with same-sex children? Same conclusion. Aggressive generalities will treat some individuals too kindly and some too savagely.Keep your prejudices all you like. Dressing your ugly prejudices to make them appear as unbiased scientific inquiry works with some, not with others. You believe homosexuals to be sub-human? I'm convinced you'll never prove it and will do yourself and others more harm than good in the process.Do you authentically want the truth or do you wish to comfort your own mean spirit?What one should ask is: Is this child happy and cared for adequately? The answers necessarily depend on specifics belonging to no one else but the child in question. As we all know, happiness is only an individual assessment. It cannot be made for you or by you for another."
1,"I did way more than ridicule.See my post on the other side.And you and jake seemed to miss the fact that, I wasn't ridiculing the fact that jake is gay. That's fine. I was ridiculing his ridiculous response, which proved him to be gay.See what I'm saying?Next, you don't know anyone who decided to be gay. You know people who were born gay, but who were told by society they weren't gay and gay is bad, so were in conflict for a large part of their lives until they realized they had been gay the whole time... like Jake :)"
2,"I don't know anyone who decided to be gay? How do you know. I in point of fact know a very nice and happy gay man, who was once engaged and has told me to my face that he was a happy straight man, did some experimentation, found someone he really liked who was a man and made a choice to live a gay lifestyle. He said he was happy either way, but thinks this is what makes him happiest.I think society tells way more people that they are gay than that they aren't. And after reading more of the responses on here it just gets back to this absurd point that those of us who are ""opposed"", and I use this term loosely because to tell you the truth, until the prop 8 fiasco in which the gay movement has begun trying to steal the right to vote from me I honestly didn't give a damn, to gay marriage are hated, disposed, called names, attacked, been told ""no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage"" as is said on this board, while we on the other side are about as polite as can be.The only hatred I've seen has been coming from the homosexual community. If you don't believe me, take a look at what they've been doing to the Mormons. I honor democracy and I despise hatred and bigotry, and it saddens me that this seems to make me the enemy of the homosexual community, which wants tolerance only for their way of thinking."
1,"That's ridiculous.That guy who was engaged then ""turned gay"" was already gay. Society told him he wasn't gay, that's why it took so long to figure out. Okay, in that example, bi-sexual. But people do not ""turn"" gay because of outside influence, it's something internal, in the brain.I think society tells way more people that they are gay than that they aren't.Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay. Do you seriously think life is somehow better or easier if you're gay? Do you not think gay people get made fun of, discriminated against, and avoided all of the time for being gay? How on earth would you justify your opinion that somehow society wants you to be gay?the gay movement has begun trying to steal the right to vote from meAgain, how so? The only right being denied in this case is homosexuals Constitutional right to the ""pursuit of happiness."" Not to mention visitation rights in hospitals, or any one of the thousands of rights denied gay couples.called names, attacked, been told ""no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage"" as is said on this board, while we on the other side are about as polite as can be.Really? So no gay person has ever been killed for being gay? Yet you're sad because someone stated the opinion that ""no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage."" Then please, by all means, make an intelligent arguemnent for your side. It will be the first.The only hatred I've seen has been coming from the homosexual community. If you don't believe me, take a look at what they've been doing to the Mormons.The mormon and catholic churches, but especially the mormon churches, spent millions trying to deny a group of people a human right, now some gays are protesting this by not shopping at their stores. And you call this ""hatred?"" Really, you need to think about this a little harder, or move on to the next subject."
2,"""That guy who was engaged then ""turned gay"" was already gay. Society told him he wasn't gay, that's why it took so long to figure out.""Lol, see again, I am flabbergasted that it is impossible for you to accept that someone might have an opinion different from yours.""Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay.""One example of society telling someone they're gay? You! You just did! To Joe. If you want another example look at any showing of a gay person on a TV show. If you act like x you are gay.""Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay.""The right to vote is being stolen in CA. Twice the majority of people voted to define marriage clearly and twice the homosexuality community has tried to overturn the will of the people by using judges. The pursuit of happiness is in the declaration of independence and not the Constitution. If this is the justification for the right to marry whomever you want, it also justifies everything else you can think of, so long as it makes the pursuer happy. There is no constitutional right to marry whomever you want. Every citizen is equally protected with the right to marry a member of the opposite sex. If you're gay, you have the right to marry. So again, what right are you being denied? Visitation rights are already granted in the state of CA, as are inheritance and all other rights of married couples, es per Gov. Davis in 2000.""Really? So no gay person has ever been killed for being gay?""African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers? Of course not. The fact that some nut-case has murdered a gay person before does not make everyone who believes homosexuality is wrong into a murderer. Are you in fear for your life often? If so I am sad, but I sort of doubt it, that's just not the way the world is anymore (in this country). Are you afraid to express your opinion about this topic? I doubt it. I am. If I tell people what I think, I LOSE MY JOB. That's why I post here anonymously :)""The Mormon and catholic churches, but especially the Mormon churches, spent millions trying to deny a group of people a human right""Marrying members of the same sex is not a human right. Sorry. Until you can show me what human right is being denied, I don't know where else to go with this. As far as the donations go, the Mormon church DID NOT DONATE A DIME. Neither did the Catholic church (I think, I'm not positive about them). MEMBERS of these churches donated to a cause they believed was right. They have the right.I have no problem with protests. I have a problem with vandalism, violence, riots, assault, disenfranchisement, and attack of religious liberty (suing to remove tax exempt status of people who disagree with them). I was opposed to it when the homosexuality was attacked and mocked and derided; I oppose it now when they do the same thing to their enemies."
1,"I just have to respond to one of your last statements:""Until you can show me what human right is being denied, I don't know where else to go with this""The right to life, LIBERTY, and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.

1,"Thanks E223, I'm getting so bored of replying to these. Tallblondguy - whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is not a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact. People are born gay, straight, or bi. Any change is due to chemical composition of the brain. People take forever coming out of the closet (often) because gays are discriminated against. The next paragraph where you say my response is an example of how society tells people to be gay... I think you miss read. It was an ironic diatribe of Jake's senseless response to gay marriage. You see, ironic because he though not intentional, was giving a bigoted response, so I pointed out how his response made it appear he was one of the people himself that he was being a bigot against... I know confusing. What's even more confusing is that infact the response would not have even worked had it been, as you said, me encouraging him to be gay... I don't, from your arguements, expect you to understand that.Okay, your entire right to vote arguement boggles the mind. According to your own arguement, (this is called a parody, it helps people like you who can't understand stuff, understand stuff. I'm waiting though for your literal response, since I'm sure you won't get the nuance) if 51% of Americans say we should reinstate slavery, then we didn't, then that means some great travesty had taken place, enough said.Uh... okay, now to where you twisted around my arguement to mean something completely and obviously different than what I said. you said that gay people were not discriminated against. I gave an example of how they were. Then you went all ""black people this"" and ""fear"" that, and went on a rant about losing your job.You seem to think I live in some state of fear? You're aware that I'm not gay right? If not, now you are, not that it matters in the least in any of my arguements. So I'm not sure why you think I may be afraid of something, but from my profile you can actually follow a link to my site, which has my name, David Heintzelman, it even has a map of exactly where I live for shits and giggles. Again, where you got the idea I was afraid is beyond me. You though... first you accuse me of being afraid, then you say how you post anonymously because... you're scared. It seems a bit schitzo.As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_11102139http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/queer-town/queer-town-the-catholic-power/ Last paragraph; you make the point earlier in your arguement (albeit the point was completely out of context of the arguement you were then debating) that just because ""African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers?"" And so I would say the same of any of the vandalism you're implying is the work of the gay hordes - of which I have heard of none, a link wouldn't hurt your arguement there.And there's a whole debate already devoted to whether religions should pay taxes, where I posted I think a couple times at least. But for the record, they should. Any group that tries to influence policies of a nation, should than have to participate as a member of that society, hence pay taxes. If religious groups want to maintain their tax exempt status, they should excuse themselves from influencing policy. You can't have your cake and eat it to."
1,The only hatred I've seen has been coming from the homosexual communityWell then your eyes are closed. Homosexuals have been discriminated against for centuries. They were even killed in the holocaust. If you don't believe that there is hate directed at homosexuals then please check out this site.http://www.godhatesfags.com/
2,"I never said they weren't discriminated against in history, that is certain and the way gays have been treated is sick. I said right now, the hatred is coming from the gay community. If you don't believe it, than just read these forums. Who is stupid? whoever disagrees with you. Who is the ""fanatical religious right?"" whoever disagrees with you. We must give you the right to do whatever you want no matter what the majority thinks. If we disagree we are driven from our jobs (the artistic director of Sacramento theater) we are attacked economically (there's a list now of everyone who donated to prop 8 and a demand to boycott their businesses) we are told that we had no right to vote that way. The Mormon church has had their buildings desecrated, their books burned, their members attacked and there is a demand to have their tax exempt status removed. Doctors are sued for refusing invitro fertilization. eharmony is sued for not providing gay matchmaking.Yes, the gay community is attacking anyone who disagrees with them and it's sick.If prop 8 had passed we would have gone with it, but we are ruthlessly attacked for disagreeing with you, and now the homosexual community is trying to destroy democracy and steal from me my right to vote because they don't think I have a right to decide where my tax money goes.ya, somewhere in the US is an asshole who loudly attacks gays, but even my best friends who are gay are full of hate for everyone who disagrees with them, and that makes me very sad."
1,"In today's society people discriminate against homosexuals all the time. In the classroom, at people's offices, in people's own families. Right now, in many places throughout the U.S. being homosexual is something to be ashamed of. When kids think something is lame what do they say? ""That's gay."" I think this fact alone speaks volumes of the homophobia in today's society.You are looking at the extreme examples at the expense of the whole picture. If someone said you could not marry the person you loved, would you be upset? Would you do whatever you could to fix what you perceived as a grave injustice? I want you to understand that I do not condone violence, but legal action is perfectly within people's rights. People are upset, and they have just reasons for being upset. If someone tells you that you were to live in a country that promises ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" but later you find out that this is a lie, wouldn't you be upset? Would you be pretty fucking pissed off? Once again, anger to the point of violence is wrong, but fighting for your rights is reasonable....hell, it's American.As for the vote on prop. 8, the majority should never have the power to take away rights from a minority group. It has happened in our past when other groups were discriminated against based on race. People voted on laws democratically, but eventually courts overturned these laws. Such was the case in California before prop. 8 was passed. The California supreme court deemed that disallowing homosexuals to marry was discriminatory. They came to this conclusion because they had to base their decision on facts. When the issue was put to a vote, people could base their decision on whatever reasons they wanted: their religious views, their ignorance, their intolerance and bigotry etc... Just because you don't want a certain group of people to not have rights doesn't allow you to take those rights away from them. You have to have a reason. A damn good one.So now, tallblondebigotedguy, what are your reasons? What do you find so wrong with two people who love each other being allowed to enter into legal marriage? I swear that I am listening to your reasons now. Don't hide behind false pretenses of discrimination, or that people don't respect your views, because until you can give me your reasoning, all of that is irrelevant."
2,"There you go again. I disagree with you, so i'm a bigot. If someone thinks anyone who disagrees with them is a bigot, what does that make them? (I'll give you a hint, it's a word you just used)The irony is that I honestly didn't give a damn about gay marriage before activists started to attack everyone who disagreed with them. My little sister was afraid to go to school for 3 weeks during the prop 8 vote. I think the problem is that the gay community thinks that discrimination is having people think they're doing something wrong, and that's simply not discrimination. The entire issue of gay marriage is centered around the idea that you want everyone not just to tolerated you, but to tell you what you're doing is ok, and if this doesn't happen, it's discrimination to you.Once again that is the decleration of independence by the way. Life liberty and pursuit of happiness. No one can show me in the CONSTITUTION where it guarantees the right to marry, and that include the tyrannical judges who base their decision based on what they think should be instead of what the law is. You know what that's called, when 7-9 judges (or really 4 or 5, since it's never been more than a simple majority) go against the constitutiont to pass a law they think is right? That's called tyranny. Do you support tyranny? What if it wasn't in your favor? What if those judges said gays should be burned? That's why there are checks and balances. I think the real problem here comes to two points that will always divide this arguement.1) you believe homosexuality is like race: something someone is born with and has no control over. The opposing side believes it is action realted, because someone is not gay, somone is living a gay lifestyle. The problem is a word symantics one. If you define gay as attracted to members of the same sex, than it's a moot point, because that person is not limited in any way. But if being gay is having a relationship with a member of the same sex, than it has become an action, and thus is not afforded any special protection because it is action-oriented. All of this is moot in my opinion because no matter what you still have all the same rights as straight people, but your arguement rests on it entirely.2) Marrying whomever you love is a basic right. This just isn't true. If it was, than what about pedophiles. Studies show many of them are born with these feelings. What about serial killers? We know they're born that way. Obviously these are extreme examples and gays and serial killers are in no way alike, but I use them as examples to show that this arguement cannot stand up legally. And besides, it's just not in the constitution.I am not a bigot. 90% of my friends are gay, and they're my very best friends. If you can pass a law that gives you the right to marry I am all for it. I may even vote for it if people ask me nicely instead of yelling at me. But I have been opposed for over 10 years to people manipulating courts to get their legistlature through.I know you think it's a right in the constitution, or you think it should be. It's not, so make it one! This vote failed, but not for long. By the time my generation is completely in charge, it will be legal the right way. So hope for that instead of bringing down our country's established system with judicial legislation (as if it could sink any lower)."
1,"“Too much talk about something that is a biological mistake of nature.”Describing   homosexuality   as a mistake is an interesting choice of terms.  It seems to represent a sound survival strategy for a species, by creating individuals who can care for young without producing young of their own.  This is similar to the survival advantage brought by menopause, where   women   lose their reproductive capability after it becomes unsafe for them to reproduce… yet they are still able to care for   children  .“If   homosexuals   were left to their own, literally, they would eventually cease to exist, unless within their confines they abandoned their sexual practices and reverted to normal reproductive sexual intercourse.”It is true that if you were to place a population of homosexuals on an island and then come back in a hundred years you would likely not find anyone alive.  However this ignores the fact that homosexuals arise from within the heterosexual population, so even if you somehow isolated ‘all’ the homosexuals there would still be new homosexuals being born.“This being evident , homosexuality is clearly outside the norm (un-natural) opposing nature etc.”How exactly does homosexuality go against nature?  Being outside the norm is far from un-natural, rather it is often an aspect of   evolution  ."
1,"Wow, I was so done with your arguements. You completely ignore every point made by anyone. Then twist around words to fit in this weird idea you have that somehow gays are discriminating against you by wanting to get married. Then you start making up stories about your sister being ""scared"" of all the gays on her way to school...At first I thought you were a sane, but misled person. Now I am really beginning to believe you are crazy.There are no gays rioting the streats. No one's lives or daughters or sisters are in mortal danger.You don't see how comments like that are even more hateful and destructive than just saying things like ""I hate fags?"" Because they really are.Then you tried to compare gay people to pediphiles! You don't see that gay marriage is between two consenting people?You really need to write an apology for this entire arguement..."
1,"Well put. I was going to respond but you basically covered everything I was going to say. I would only add that I never said he was a bigot for opposing marriage, I was talking about how he does recognize where the real discrimination is coming from."
2,"OK, I am in perfect agreement with you that this conversation should probably be over. I'll respond to both posts. First, I don't apologize for my opinions. I have, however, clarified to my earlier post, that when I forgot to specifically mention pedophilia as being unrelated to homosexuality, I assumed the reader would group pedophilia and serial murder. I have clarified this point, and I'll say again, pedophilia and serial killing are in no way similar to homosexuality. I was merely using hyperbole to show that people do not have a right to do everything they are born desiring.""whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is not a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact.""http://www.cwfa.org/images/content/bornorbred.pdf  a scholarly response to the idea that this has been pr oven. I'm sure we can both go on all day posting on this idea, the reality is we just don't know. I personally believe people are born with a predisposition toward homosexuality which can either be cultivated or repressed, but everyone has the ability to make decisions in their life. Besides, no one is arguing gays should stop what they're doing (well, some people probably are).Again, ad homonyms all over. It seems If anyone says something you disagree with the best thing to do is call them hateful and stupid. Oh and gay, but I guess I'm too dumb to get that.If 51% of people voted for slavery it wouldn't matter because slavery is made illegal by the constitution and the courts would then have an obligation to point that out. That's what it's for. If anyone can show me where it says you have a right to marry whomever you want in the constitution I will go picket in CA right now.I guess I should be more clear. Gay people have been persecuted for a long time. It's a shame they feel the need to persecute others now that they are gaining popularity. And you can call me a liar whenever you disagree with me if you like (it's very effective I'm sure), but my sister cried every day during the prop 8 thing because she supported it and she was constantly harassed. I never said she was afraid for her life, but that does make the story more interesting, doesn't it :)""You seem to think I live in some state of fear?""This was also irony. I was suggesting that discrimination against gays has largely disappeared (that doesn't mean everyone agrees with you, it just means their rights are no longer being violated, i.e. they can get work, they don't get killed (hopefully!), etc). I apologize about thinking you were gay (not that its bad), you made a comment on an earlier post that I must have misunderstood.""As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...""I hate to play the ""I'm right"" game, but I am here. Do more research, my father is a leader in the Mormon church. While church members donated and were asked to support the legislature, the church itself did not make any political donations. I'm not as sure about the Catholics, but if they're smart they played it the same way. I agree that some of the churches which are heavily political (i.e. Jeremiah Wright?) should get out of politics or be taxed as political entities. Churches do, however, have a right to encourage voting on moral issues (it's actually in the law, believe it or not), and both of these churches are silent on political issues outside of this.I won't apologize for my opinion. The real irony is that I'm not even opposed to gay marriage. I'm opposed to people who will do anything to get their way, no matter who it hurts. Anyway, you've heard my point of view. I will change it the minute anyone can shows me that gay marriage is a protected constitutional right, or when a vote is passed. Until then, I respect your right to believe in whatever you want, and I even respect your right to hate and mock everyone who disagrees with you (thought I will then ask you to respect my right to call you a hateful shallow bigot. yay free speech). I would honestly be happy for everyone to just say, look, you and I disagree, but we have that right and we can still be friends, because right now that's not happening... Oh, and I still don't like the courts usurping authority not given to then by the constitution :)"
2,"OK, so apparently I need to clarify every single statement and point out that when I said gays are not like serial killers AT ALL, and this was merely hyperbole to show a fallacious argument, I forgot to mention pedophilia. Homosexuality and pedophilia are obviously not related AT ALL. i thought this was pretty obvious from the way I wrote it, but apparently some people need it spelled out. I should have been more clear however."
1,"Gay ""marriage"" doesn't hurt anyone in a sense that it threatens traditional marriage (that between a man and woman). I say ""marriage"" in reference to gay ""marriage"" because marriage is understood to be between a man and woman in the very sense of the term, as a religious term. Gay's should be allowed to commit to one another and in a sense assume responsibility that a husband and wife would."
1,If two consenting adults love each other and want to make a life long commitment of marriage they should be allowed to do so.
1,"I don't believe that gay marriage can hurt anyone, people just tend not to like seeing the same sex together, its just awkward,that's why there is men and women. Can't find a woman you like, keep looking because there are plenty in the sea."
1,"It can't. It's a free choice, it's not like married gay people are out to get us and murder us in our sleep. I honestly don't know why everyone makes such a fuss about it I MEAN HONESTLY. GOODNESS. That's kind of discrimination."
1,"Ok, this debate has caught alot of attention, so i'm going to put my two cents in...Gay marriage mmmm, so I am going to say is for those of you who thinks it does, do diffrent color people marrying each other bug you or has the debate says hurt you? Should a Elephant marry a mouse? The only person that gay marriage can hurt is the ones in the marriage. Now, I'm not for it, but I'm not going to waste my time fretting over it. Well you can say I'm not against either. Who knows I might fall in love with a chick and marry her one day, it's the love I think that matters, and other people should mind thier own business!"
1,"As quoted, they have every right to believe what they want to believe and behave the way they do. I think that every single one of us should have the right to be with the person they want to be with; be it a man or a woman."
1,"None taken, your tactic of ignoring those that offer reasonable counter-arguments rather obvious at this point."
1,"I don't see any person hurting just because of gay marriage, unless somebody is in love in one of them. I think that we should give them this complete right to be married and settled life as they wan it. Most of them has really proven their worth and I think that we should give them their much needed freedom to be happy."
1,"I don't believe gay marriage hurts anyone. The only people truly making it such a mad case is religious people. Sure, marriage is somewhat an act out of religion, but like others said, what is it if someone unreligious gets married? If people are going to make a big deal out of two people of the same sex getting married, then people of different religions, people of no religion, even people guilty of adultery shouldn't be allowed to marry either. Being against gay marriage really comes down to what people that follow the bible say the bible says. Which makes gay marriage against the bible, right? But then again, every single person on this planet is doing lots of stuff against the bible. So, really, what gives these religious people the right to say someone can't do something they disapprove of? Otherwise, I'd like to meet a non-religious person, or even a person acquainted with gay's, who is against gay marriage. (Just because it proves my case otherwise that it's all about religious bitching and it has not one thing to do with them personally). So, really, gay marriage is hurting those that let it hurt them for no rightful reason."
1,"Haven't you heard? The instant that two people of the same sex are married, a cloud of noxious gas descends over the area around them in a six-mile radius.Of course gay marriage doesn't hurt anyone! It doesn't hurt anyone's religious beliefs, as I'm sure the religious right will cling to their religion with a determination that can only be produced by fear. It doesn't hurt anyone morally, as marriage is something that happens out of love. And, obviously, it doesn't hurt anyone physically.So what's the problem?"
1,"While I think that it could bring about a whole new class of social implications, I don't believe that any of them have the inherent ability to hurt anyone. It's like the prohibition of marijuana on the bases that it's a ""gateway drug"". It may be true that people that are now on heroin have tried weed, it doesn't mean that it lead these people without control, to heroin. The same as saying people that do drive-by-shootings began their vehicular criminal life by driving to the mall, or at the DMV.  The theoretical implication to marriage between a man and man or a woman and a woman are the same as a man and woman. Then again, maybe you should be so bold as to ask a more correct question ""How can marriage, in general, hurt anyone""."
1,"Why would it? If you dont like it, then guess what? You have nothing to do about it! Gay people exist! They are part of our world! The shouldnt be humiliated and, why on earth, would they be?They have a right just like everyone else, they are not aliens!!"
1,"It doesent hurt anyone, if they want to be together, who are we stopping them?"
1,It doesn't hurt anyone and for years straight people have been doing a good enough job ruining marriage themselves. Look at the divorce rate gay people have had nothing to do with that. Not to mention the people most likely to divorce do live in red states. Gay people deserve the same rights as everyone else and civil unions are not seperate but equal.
1,"Well me being in the gay community of course i dont think it hurts anyone. The only people i can see that it hurts, would possibly be the parents of gays. Other than that if people just mind there business, and not discriminate against gays then it'll all be ok."
1,"a good point, no one else has brought up the parents. and not wanting my opinion to be misconstrued, i would like to say that if gay marriage was accepted, and gay people themselves, i dont think that the parents would be hurt so much. i think they are mostly hurt because they dont think it is good for their kids bc society like to push that opinion."
1,"Hurt is a broad term, but if to be taken in the context of marriage the main aspect of this union are the people participating in it. Given this fact, since they choose to marry each other regardless of orientation or gender, it definitely doesn't hurt anyone. People in contact with these gay couples might disapprove of their status but other than having their ideals or opinions contested, in no way are they distinguishably hurt per se."

1,"I've been in these discussion before, and a common refrain from the anti-same sex parents contingent is to say tha children with same-sex parents are subject to teasing and discrimination that leaves them emotionally damaged. If this is true, and it seems reasonable, the solution is not to condemn same-sex households, but to stop discriminating. If same-sex parents were given equal societal and legal status as heterosexual parents, many of the challeneges children of same-sex parents face would disappear. "
1,"I don't think it hurts anyone, really. Except for maybe people who are indecisive about their sexual orientation and are losing sleep over it."
1,"If I was born with a sexual attraction to children, I wouldn't act on it. I know I was born gay. There are some men with an extra x chromosome who are gay and many have sex change operations. Do they have less rights as a human because of that fact. Don't argue the slippery slope. It fails. You may have feelings but u don't act on it with minors period. And with 90 per cent heterosexuals, it's good that there are some people who don't procreate. We live in a world of finite resources. As long as 2 consenting adults love each other, leave them be. It's a free country that way. It's a right. Don't argue over the word marriage,use a different term but give the same rights."
1,"i just wanted to add this, butsince aids comes from monkies....im pretty sure gay people didnt spread the first strain through humanity. i would venture to guess, that some straight guy out in the jungle on some expedition thing, got really horny and fucked a monkey. a gay guy, would just go have sex with the other gay guys there. and, they tend to be cleaner and pickier, so i dont think they would go for a monkey....0.0(yes, an immature thing to say, but hey, alot of the people here are already saying stupid crap, i thought id add this too)"
1,"I think that it hurts people's sensabilities if anything, but the amount of adultery and divroce hurts mine. Adultery is immoral, yet that fact isn't stopping anyone. I think it is that individuals choice. What if straight people are simply getting married simply for the benefits, but no one is taking away their choice to get married."
1,me i have a gay aunt and it doesn't hurt me because its a lifestyle choices so who ever thinks that it hurts anyone then something is wrong with you because there's nothing wrong its that that ginger likes the same ginger son thats what i got to say and remember IT DO NOT HURT ANYONE SO GET OVER IT
1,"I think the argument of sanctity of marriage is horrific.If you make yourself a loaf of bread and eat it day after day, will it taste any worse if someone else on another planet also gets to make his/her own loaf or bread and eat it?No it won't. Will the loaf you eat be any less nutritious if someone else on a remote planet also does the same?No.Ergo sanctity of marriage is nothing but jealousy of marriage in disguise. You only want marriage for yourself so you can have something that someone else doesn't.GROW UP KIDS! That kind of behaviours is criticized in kindergarten when a bully wants to have a playground ride only to himself.Not that I support marriage, I just support everyone's right to call their bond marriage. It's such a stupid trivial childish crap, but since people take is seriously, then I suppose I have to too.[edit]Hmm, I already used that argument on some other debate, except that I used beans instead of bread."

1,"I want to point out a seldom talked about but nevertheless very important point:Gay marriage absolutely does erode ""family"", and here is why: the church - the summation of all religious institutions - wants to control the relationship between children and parents. This is of utmost importance to the church, because parents are the most reliable tool of mass religious indoctrination; and because much of the ""sacred"" beliefs are delivered as interaction between parents and children, which the followers are supposed to model. This is why the church seeks to control both licensing to procreation (marriage) and procreation itself (promiscuity, abortions, gay marriage). Anyone who treads on these interests of the church is opposed by the church because losing any of these defense lines directly reduces the church's market which is never going to come back. Gay marriage does exactly what the conservatives are complaining about: the necessity to allow gay people to marry means taking away the marriage prerogative from the church. It directly results in less believers and thus harms the religious thought as a whole.Gay marriage destroys marriage and traditional values, and that's why it's a great thing."
2,"""Gay marriage destroys marriage and traditional values, and that's why it's a great thing.""this is why the prop 8 passed. on the one hand. . .you all want the white picket fenceon the other. . .it sucks and we are freakin' stupid for buying into it. so why do you want that which you claim to hate?as a married woman with children I have been called a breeder on various women forums. and the concept that children are merely excessive consumerism run amok that they hate seeing in their daily life. this idea was put forth many times by women who thought my being married, to a man no less was pretty much the same as me tattooing slave on my forehead.I accept you for who you are. why do you want to be me? and if you want to be me why the disdain for my choices?"
1,"1) gay marriage does not ""erode family"" if anything, they are happyier bc that family actually wanted their child, they didnt have an accidental condom breaking baby, so they were prepared.2) if they did, that shouldnt be why you vote for it, that is in fact, the stupidest thing ive read on this page. ""ooooo, vote for this bc it destroys religions!!!"" how immature and stupid. are you trying to look cool or somthing? bc it didnt work."
1,"This was the very excuse given me by my mother when she explained to me why two people of different races should not marry.  She carefully explained to me that, ""while there was nothing wrong with black people,"" still, there were ""cultural differences"" which would make such a marriage more ""difficult"" and the children would be ""negatively impacted"" by the teasing they would face from other children.Therefore, ipso facto, interracial marriage should be illegal (or immoral, or both).  Please.  :roll-eyes-and-sigh:"
2,"I think the major point that everyone is missing is that few people would get married if it were not for the benefits attached to such a union. If you remove the benefits, would anyone wish to get married?Another point of issue, marriage is a religious icon. Why is the government issuing benefits based on the edicts of established religion? If people wish to get married or divorced, why does Uncle Sam or any of the 50 states really care?So to summarize, Gay marriage does hurt us. It hurts us by allowing the government to further violate the constitution by respecting the beliefs of established religion. I vote against Gay marriage and I vote against ANY form of marriage where two people must register their union with the government.Our forefathers fought against the stamp tax, yet 240 years later the constitution has been raped and the very laws we fought against have been slowly yoked around our necks."
1,"""few people would get married if it were not for the benefits attached to such a union.""I seriously doubt this. People get married for religious, cultural, and personal reasons. I think tax benefits and what have you are just an afterthought for most people.""Gay marriage hurts us by allowing the government to further violate the constitution by respecting the beliefs of established religion.""By this logic, all marriage hurts us."
1,Agreed. I personally think state governments should not be able to grant marriages and should only be able to grant civil unions to everyone. Marriages are too religious. The next best alternative is to allow gay marriage. But I agree that marriage does violate the constitution especially if religious reasons are used to bar certain people from entering marriages.
1,It's not favoring religion if two atheists get married
1,Well marriage is a religious ceremony. If two atheists get married it is still their belief. You cant have a non-religious marriage
1,"Yes you can, atheism isn't a religion, it's the rejection of religion."
2,"What I am trying to say is there should not be non-religous marriage. Atheists should not marry, if they are rejecting religion. If this was followed, THEN you couldn't have a non-religious marriage."
1,I did not marry for benefits. I married to share my life with my husband and make a family. A good marriage has quite a lot of sacrifice from both the husband and the wife. Pretty much most benefits (like being able to raise your own kids) have been screwed by this economy.
1,"""I think the major point that everyone is missing is that few people would get married if it were not for the benefits attached to such a union. If you remove the benefits, would anyone wish to get married?""Is LOVE not an acceptable answer?"
1,"I think the major point that everyone is missing is that few people would get married if it were not for the benefits attached to such a union. If you remove the benefits, would anyone wish to get married?Marriage began as a business arrangement to secure the merging of resources between two families (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#European_marriages).  It had no special religious significance. Many people today continue to have secular marriages.However, once the state started recognizing marriages, then things like tax breaks, parental rights, hospital visitation rights, judicial protections, etc became legal benefits. The church doesn't, has never, and will never give married couples these rights.To summarize, how does giving others rights take away your rights?"
1,"You should, perhaps, question your assumptions that a child ""needs"" two parents. For the reasons I stated before - the variable personality of the child and variable personality of the parent(s), one can make general statements of what is common to all children and common to all parents, but one really can't say definitively that the specific needs of one child are the same specific needs of another. You will no doubt find individuals in all cutlures who got along just fine with only one parent - of either gender - and likely will find individuals who had more than two who profited from that arrangement. You will also find plenty of individuals who had what is considered by some to be the ""optimum parental arrangement"" - two parents of opposite genders who are permanently scarred by that experience.All of this to say - the assumption that a child needs two parents of opposite gender to grow up happy and well-adjusted is likely as false as the assumption the child needs two. I dare say - and from personal experience - some children need no parent at all."
1,"im getting married soon myself, and it is not for the benefits, i actually havent even bothered to find out what they are. it is also not for religion, my religion doesnt require getting legally married. it is so that i have somthing to show the world about my life. also, It hurts us by allowing the government to further violate the constitution by respecting the beliefs of established religion.the point of the constitution was so that we would have to respect the beliefs of other religions, instead of persecuting them. plus, the religion that the law is based primarily on (christianity) is against it, so how is supporting gay marriage supporting a religion?while i do support your statement about people should not have to register with the government to get married, i do think that it is good, otherwise people would have more than one spouse and get hurt more due to that."

2,"What people like you don't get is that people who are legally married to a member of the same sex usually want to adopt. The child of the couple is going to be hurt mentally because it is healthy for a child to grow up in a household with one mom and one dad. The mom and the dad each contribute something to how the child acts and feels. Without either a mom or a dad the child is mentally hurt because they do not have that influence. I am not saying the child is mentally retarded, but it is much more healthy to have one mom and one dad. I sometimes will say that I support the right to marry but not to adopt.My problem with that statement, though, is that the bible makes references where it says that a marrige is to be strictly between only one man and one woman. My stance on the issue is that I am somewhere between no tolerance and some to little tolerance."
2,"yeah i agree with him, but i don't have any tolerance for it. its supposed to be between a man and a woman. it is their sacred right given to them by God."
1,"Thanks for your expert analysis. Congratulations on getting your PhD in developmental psychology by the way. Now that you are done with your speculation I will provide you with an actual study. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/514477 Every other study I have seen found the same results. Furthermore what about single parents? Should they be allowed to have kids or adopt? My guess is you think so. They are not getting the influence of both a mom and dad, just like you think how same-sex couples raise kids, so what's the difference?The bible should never be any justification for laws. Regardless of the fact that it is a piece of fiction, it violates the establishment clause of the first amendment of the constitution."
1,"1st off, the bible is not hte government, the two should be separate, that is the point of the constitution, if you get rid of the consitution, you kill america in one fell swoop. 2nd, when i was younger, i knew a kid with lesbians for parents. he was fine, it didnt make him gay, it didnt make him anything other than normal. he was just like all the other kids in high school. something you seem to be missing, is that ALL relationships, especially those with children, have one person who take the feminen part and one who take the masculine part. the gender doesnt actually matter, unless you plan on showing your ""parts"" to your child, in which case, yes, they will end up messed up bc you have mentally scarred them."
1,So your stance is that a child would rather be in an orphanage than with a gay couple who loved him or her?
2,"1. I have nothing against gays being in some sort of legal binding (for the lack of better word I can't think of right now), but do not call it a marriage. Even 50 years from today, it will not be accepted in general although some will accept for the purpose of political correctness.2. Although many of you might say that it would never happen, this will lead for other movements whose marital ideas would disgust most of us: people marring animals, minors, bugs, extra-terrestrials.........don't be surprised at all if such a movement is strongly established in less than a decade. It is a simple ""if he/she can, why can't I?"", it is my Constitutional right. Don't forget, people always like to see how far they can take it plus it is a way to differentiate yourself from the general public. It is only in human nature to do so. There has to be some limit."
1,"Are you serious? Are you trying to come out of some kind of closet right now?Marriage means nothing. I am against marriage personally, I dont think ANYONE should get married. It is just a way for the government to control you. I do not want to have to ask a judge if I can break up with my gf. I also believe that if someone chooses to do this, whether they are gay, straight, or wants to marry an extra-terrestrial (you do know that if aliens from another planet came here and looked simular to us, that you homo-phobes would not even blink at the prospect of them getting married to us as long as it was male to female?) then they have the CHOICE, that is what freedom is all about."
1,Well I guess you are right. Because it is impossible to argue with an imaginary god's word. lol
2,I don't mean to insult you sir/madam but your commentary is so long and boring that it's shocking.  I know you think it is eloquent and highly intelligent but you just need to relax a little.  Thank you.
2,"So I've been reading these points by all and I think we really need to step back and take a ""chill pill"" :) Opposing gay marriage doesn't mean we're ""homophobic"" or hate gays, so let's keep the ad homonym attacks to a minimum. I am opposed to gay marriage for a couple of very specific reasons, but I am in the theater business and of about 30 guys who are my close friends, 29 of them are probably gay, and I love them like crazy!So again I want to say that, to use the debates words (although I think they are a little inflammatory), gay marriage does hurt everyone for the following reason: The prominent justification for gay marriage is that it is a right and that denying it will take away the rights of a minority, similar to the civil rights movement. Using this justification, any religious group that denies gays participation or clergy or marriage will be branded as persecuting homosexuals. The scary thing is that there are some people reading this right now and thinking ""yes, that would be discrimination and homophobia and should be stopped."" I just read a quote:'Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor and gay activist who helps draft federal legislation related to sexual orientation, says that, when religious liberty conflicts with gay rights, “I’m having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.”' http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTU5MjZmMDIyMDU3NjRiMjBlNjcxYTlmOGQ2ODA5NjA=  (an altogether fetching article which says this entire thing much better than I have)Gay marriage is an immediate threat to our freedoms AS IT IS CURRENTLY being pursued. The owners of eharmony.com are REQUIRED to provide gay matchmaking. They have no freedom to do otherwise. Doctors who provide in vitro fertilization are REQUIRED to do it for lesbian couples, even if this is against their beliefs. These doctors have lost their freedom.Now gay marriage DOESN'T have to be this way. Pass legal laws which respect the beliefs of others. As I said, i love my gay friends, and I might be ok with some of them marrying (I say might because of all of these people, I can think of only one couple that even pretends to be serious about their relationship, and I think they are adorable! The others shouldn't marry imo, whether they are gay or straight or anything because they aren't serious, but that's just my opinion and it's honestly none of my business :). So as i said, go ahead and pass the laws, but don't take away the rights of others to believe that homosexuality is wrong, because THAT is what is against the constitution."

Whether or not eharmony should be required to provide service to homosexuals has little to do with whether homosexuals should be allowed to marry. Same with in vitro. The issue is not ""Are gays entitled to do everything that straight people are?"", the question is, ""How does gay marriage hurt anyone?"""
1,"exactly, eharmony is required to provide matches to african-american people too, but, what if the owners dont want to? should they have that right? no!so why should they have the right to descriminate against anyone?"

1,"I like how you attack my unfounded statement by making an unfounded statement of your own.Anyway, I looked it up and it seems nature and nuture both play a role:""There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay, or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.""http://www.apa.org/topics/sorientation.html"
1,"so do people wake up one morning and deside, hey, im going to like people of blank gender!no, they do not. you start getting crushes and likeing people in pre-school, what could have already influenced them by then? they havent been exposed to sex or anything, they dont know what ""gay"" is, so how can they be influenced or choose?"
1,"You also don't become gay from ""influences from your peers and society."" There is at this point more evidence that supports biological and genetic reasons for a person being homosexual. (Identical twins are considerably more likely to have the same sexual orientation, sexual preference can be changed in rats, fruit flies, and other animals with simpler minds, a gay man's brain has characteristics that look more like a straight female""s, and so on and so on.) However, sexuality is one of the most complex psychological processes of humanity and thus there is not a conclusive answer on the whole nature vs. nurture argument. So basically your statement is ""unfounded"" as well."

2,It hurts when they want to teach kids in school that. I like that we have a system and a fabric that rewards a man and women to marry. People don't want it and thats why they have petitioned to remove it from states that have made it law only on judicial reasons which is unconstitutional.

He's right that its a personal choice but he took it so lightly. Thanks to the media. What if this kid was your son? I'm not against gay people at all. Just how it affects people that would have been straight."

1,"Gay Parenting Does Affect Children Differently, Study Finds-- Authors Believe Gay Parents Have ""Some Advantages""Taking issue with 20 years of research conclusions that say there are no differences, two University of California sociologists recently re-examined data from 21 studies on gay parenting dating back to 1980. The new study by two University of Southern California sociologists says children with lesbian or gay parents show more empathy for social diversity, are less confined by gender stereotypes, and are probably more likely to explore homosexual activity themselves. Writing in recent issue of the American Sociological Review, the authors say that the emotional health of the two sets of children is essentially the same. Leaders of national gay-affirming groups said they welcomed the article, according to an Associated Press story. ""I'm thrilled that they're tackling these issues,"" said Aimee Gelnaw, executive director of the Family Pride Coalition, who is a lesbian parent raising two children with her partner. ""Of course our kids are going to be different,"" Gelnaw said. ""They're growing up in a different social context."" Openness to Gay RelationshipsMet With ""Elation""Kate Kendall, head of the San Francisco-based National Center for Lesbian Rights, also is raising two children with her partner. ""There's only one response to a study that children raised by lesbian and gay parents may be somewhat more likely to reject notions of rigid sexual orientation -- that response has to be elation,"" Kendall said. But Amy Desai, a policy analyst with the group Focus on the Family, said the new report is alarming in its suggestions that children of gay parents might be more open to homosexual activity. ""Kids do best when they have a married mother and a married father,"" she said. A Home With No Dad is Better?The study's co-author, Judith Stacey, is a professor of contemporary gender studies. In addition to pointing out the gender differences in the two groups of children, she states that there are in fact some advantages to an all-female parental team without Dad living in the home: a female couple tends to be more involved in the children's lives and is in greater harmony in terms of parenting approaches. Among the findings cited by the authors: 1. Compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They show greater interest in activities with both masculine and feminine qualities. They have higher aspirations to occupations that are not traditionally female. 2. In terms of aggression and play, sons of lesbians behave in less traditionally masculine ways. They are likely to be more nurturing and affectionate than their counterparts in heterosexual families. 3. One study examined by the researchers indicated that a significantly greater proportion of young adult children raised by lesbians had engaged in a same-sex relationship (six of 25 interviewed) than those raised by a heterosexual mother (none of 20 interviewed). 4. Those raised by lesbian mothers were also more likely to consider a homosexual relationship. 5. Teen-age and young adult girls raised by lesbian mothers appear to be more sexually adventurous and less chaste than girls raised by heterosexual mothers. Sons, on the other hand, were somewhat less sexually adventurous and more chaste than boys raised by heterosexuals. 6. The studies indicate that sexual orientation has no measurable effect on the quality of parent-child relationships or on the mental health of children. ""These studies find no significant differences between children of lesbian and heterosexual mothers in anxiety, depression, self-esteem and numerous other measures of social and psychological adjustment,"" said the authors. NARTH""s Joseph Nicolosi offered the following comments: ""This paper was authored by a professor of gender studies, so it is not surprisingly that the differences on which she focused have to do with a rejection of gender conformity. Indeed, what she found makes sense -- lesbian mothers tend to have a feminizing effect on their sons, and a masculinizing effect on their daughters. ""But the question is, are these differences healthy? More research is needed to understand how a rejection of conventional gender roles can have not just a healthy and expansive, but also a constricting and negative effect on identity and psychological health. ""And despite what many gender researchers claim, research tells us that the absence of a father in the home is not, on balance, good for families.""

1,"So because a homosexual family does not fit the traditional definition of family they shouldn't be allowed to have kids? Orphans who have no parents are better off than if they have two parents who happen to be of the same sex?Trust me when I say, no kids are hurt by having homosexual parents. I know first hand and many researchers have shown that two parents, regardless of gender, are better off then one or no parents. Also what activities are you talking about? A girl with two moms won't have a date for the father daughter dance? Is that the biggest complaint you have? If you think we should deny people rights because school functions may need to be redefined then I think you need to get your priorities straight."
2,"1) man+man, woman+woman. . .marriage of equals. man+woman is not. 2) why stop at gay marriage. What about bi marriage? man+woman+woman . .might get a small percentage of Mormons to support this. 3) Where will the line be drawn? AI? All the arguements used in favor of gay marriage could be used to support the idea of android marriage. sure we aren't there yet. .but again the line is where?4) marriage is not a right. it is tied up in regulations, but the act itself is not done as a right, like voting. 4) it is not religious. religion has taken over the ceremony, but it is not christian or jewish or phoenician . . marriage predates recordable history. 5) war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength changing the meanings of important words can hurt. and if the dialog on this is drowned out by extreme rhetoric than everybody loses."
1,reminds me of hitting puberty and dealing with the baggage of having  different-sex parents which was so confusing and made absolutely no sense to me as a gay teenager who was attracted only to boys...
1,"In #2 you are confusing monogamy with polygamy (you call it ""bi-marriage"")"
2,we are redefining marriage so it is presumptuous of you to assume that monogamy is the only way to live. it's my right as a bisexual to be able to be with both the people I love. now how can you argue with this? are you not placing the same meaningless societal boundaries on the bisexual that you claim others are on you?what justification do you have to not allow this? and remember no religion or stupid nonsense taboos. actually as a married woman the idea of an extra wife has always sounded okay.
1,"1) Man+man is a marriage of equals. Ok. So what?2) Marriage between a man and two women. That's a separate debate.3) Marriage between a man and an android. That's a separate debate.4) Marriage is not a right. Ok, but gay marriage still doesn't hurt anyone.4) Marriage is not religious. Ok. So what?5) Changing the meanings of important words can hurt. Ok. But changing the meaning of marriage to allow gays to marry doesn't hurt anyone."
2,"1) because spousal abuse is already not taken seriously AND two men have vastly superior earning potential than a man and a woman. . .AND the protection of spousal support will also get clouded.2) well for some of us this issue is separate.

1,"1a) First, spousal abuse is taken very seriously. Second, how in the world would two dudes getting married cause people to take spousal abuse less seriously? There's no connection there.1b) Two men have vastly superior earning potential. Ok. So what?1c) ""The protection of spousal support"" What does this even mean?2) ""now anything else is SOMETHING ELSE"" Um... you've got me there... lol4) I'm swinging nothing, madam. Gay marriage is not a right. Regular marriage also is not a right. Does that mean regular marriage should be illegal?5) But religion is the reason people are saying no to gay marriage. I see no other reason to oppose it. I will admit that I do take some pleasure in f'ing with you :) However, I also feel strongly that gays should be allowed to marry and I am honestly trying to persuade you that I am right.6) Divorce and gay marriage are two separate issues. I agree that divorce hurts people. But I still don't see how gay marriage hurts anyone."
2,"It's one thing for gay couples to adopt their own lifestyle, but they've moved far beyond that. Now they are demanding that the rest of society change its traditions and institutions to suit them. This isn't about insurance or inheritance benefits for gay couples (which I have no problem with). It's about redefining an institution older than civilization itself. If a two men or two women can marry, why not three men or four women? Or fathers and daughters who happen to be consenting adults?"
1,"Well, you see gay couples getting married doesn't hurt anyone while the rest of your examples do. A father and daughter getting married, then the kids are usually deformed, and that is hurting their child. Three men or four women, is polygamy which is illegal, because some of those in the marriage could be hurt emotionally by it. Also this is your religious belief with the insitution older then civilisation itself stuff. Seperation of church and state should always be remembered."
1,You make a point against gay marriage by claiming that it would inevitably lead to man-dog marriage or daughter-mother (gay AND incest) which is wrong. There is no logic behind this reasoning. The question is whether gay marriage should be allowed for the gays to benefit from exactly the reasons you claim you have no problem with(insurance and inheritance). The question is if a gay marriage hurts anyone in any way. Which you haven't addressed in the slightest.
1,Nobody wants to redefine marriage. We just want to expand the definition slightly to be fair to homosexuals.
1,"Let's stay on subject, okay? Saying that two people who love each other can't get married because it will open the door for other groups is a ridiculous argument. By that logic we should get rid of marriage altogether, this way none of that can happen.Just because an institution is old doesn't mean it shouldn't be changed. Actually, the fact that it is so old is even more of a reason for it to change. Our thinking has advanced since then and our institutions should reflect that . Homosexuals aren't asking anyone to change their way of life...they just want the same rights that everyone else has: the right to marry who they love.So allow me to repeat the question you failed to answer: How can gay marriage hurt any one?"
1,"The question of advantage or disadvantage might more appropriately be asked about same race (of the child’s, each other, yours or predominate in their society), same religion (of the child’s parents, each other, yours, predominate in their society or the true one), income of parents, assets of parents, quality of neighborhood…Why limit your inquiry to this issue unless you have a transparent agenda of a particular group you wish to discriminate against?The only true family values are love and commitment."
1,"The argument you are making would have applied to interracial marriage when it was illegal, so acknowledge that you would have been against interracial marriage when it was illegal or admit your hypocrisy."
1,fathers and a daughters cant get married bc when you inbreed the children come out with missing chromosomes and cross eyes.
1,"""why not three men and four women. Or fathers and daughters ...""Ah! See, now if you were true to Christian teachings, you would support that because clearly that is Biblical traditional families. Why do you question the morality of Moses? (He had sex with not one but both of his daughters.) Why do you question the entire human race from a Biblical perspective? (Noah; Adam & Eve).I'm not asking anyone to ""approve"" my lifestyle. I'm demanding as a citizen to be treated equally, ""which I have no problem with"" because IT IS ABOUT inheritance and tax benefits.There is no federal recognition of a legal same sex marriage even in those states that allow it. Equal taxation is denied. No one is asking you to change your precious ""traditions and institutions"". Stop acting as if you are some poor put upon person because God forbid, some human being that you don't approve of is happy. Get a life.Let me ask you this. Do you revere your marriage so much that you have you marriage license framed and hanging in your living room, signed by everyone at your wedding? Do you keep that prominent and show it off to everyone as a testament to your commitment to another human being, whom you love greatly? Do you pass by it every day, smile, think deeply, and reaffirm that love?No? Well, I have two gay friends who do, and they've been together for about 20 years. How dare you suggest that you somehow get to have a say in their love and commitment for each other. Who the hell asked you? No one passed judgment on your love, why do you defy Jesus himself by judging others."
2,"The only way it could possibly ""hurt"" anyone is if someone let themselves be hurt by this upcoming acceptance of Gays into society. We had the same issues with blacks integrading into society and women getting voting rights. The only reason it could possibly hurt someone is if they have a stubborn view on the world that makes them believe gays are in the wrong and should not be allowed the same rights as heterosexual people. ""History must repeat itself because we pay such little attention to it the first time."" That is what is happening right now."
2,"""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."" —Genesis 1:27Our Lord, in His answer to the Pharisees concerning divorce, refers to this passage in Genesis and confirms its special application to marriage. ""Have ye not read,"" He said, ‘that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female? and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.""' Marriage is derived from the Lord, for male and female. It has its highest and perfect form in Him, for in Him love and wisdom are one.So how can gay marriage hurt any one? This is a very deep, complicated question and answer. (And please know, anyone that believes they are gay out there, I am not judging you. You are not horrible, and it is only my responsibility to share the truth of God's word to those who may stray from it or don't understand it.) It hurts God, don't you see? All sin does. Whenever man decides what is actually right and moral for himself, independent of God's wisdom, he always hurts himself because he has disconnected himself from God's plan for his life. And if he strays from God's plan, the course he takes can affect all of humanity—like the domino effect.I take it for certain that the physical satisfaction of homosexual desires is sin. However, this leaves the homosexual person no worse off than any heterosexual person who is, for whatever reason, prevented from marrying, or from participating in sex outside the sanctity of marriage. Or any other sin for that matter.People—primarily the homosexual community—say, ""Who are others to say who we should be able to love?"" (or in this case, marry) Let me ask you this: Have we not all loved our our same-sex friends as much as we've loved the opposite sex? I have loved my friends as much, sometimes more than a mate (after all, the opposite sex is oh so confusing at times!) But the difference is we do not desire to have sex with them. Aha—therein lies the heart of the controversy over homosexuality, and homosexual ""marriages."" You see the truth is, it's not about ""love""—it is about sex, and who these people desire to love, is who they desire to have sex with. I can already hear everyone saying, ""So what?! Of course people want to have sex with whomever they love..."" But no. Sex has been perverted and removed from its original design. First we love, then we marry, then we consummate our marriage (it is just the icing) and the marriage (the love) is preserved through commitment before God. Again, I hear folks saying ""Well that's what homosexuals want to do!"" First, we must understand that love begins with God. So many people misread and misuse Scripture and quote Jesus as saying, in regard to what the highest commandments are, ""... to love thy neighbor as thyself..."" for their arguments. But note that Jesus says, ""commandmentS""—plural. Immediately proceeding ""love thy neighbor as thyself"" He says the first and greatest commandment is ""You shall love thy Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."" [Following is the second greatest commandment] ""Love thy neighbor as thyself."" So if homosexuals reject God's teachings on love and marriage and sex, how then can they use the argument that 'they just want to be able to love whomever they want' ? —They actually want to have sex with whomever they want, otherwise they would just remain the best of friends, you see? That is not the same. And then, they want to take it a step further, and sanctify it in holy marriage. This is re-writing the Bible to suit their own desires which is strictly forbidden. People may love whomever they want. They just can't have sex with whomever they want. Well, actually they CAN—there is free will. Some say they were born this way. I say that in some cases this is actually true. In many cases it is a choice. But let's say they were born that way. There are alcoholics and depressed persons and naturally promiscuous persons and all kinds of burdens passed on in birth—this is what's called ""our cross to bare""... Sometimes we have to make the choice to sacrifice an urge or desire to sin and in turn use this struggle for the good of all. Or we can succumb to it and let the consequences fall where they may. But I'd say 98% of our population has some sort of dilemma to struggle with. Like all other tribulations, it must be offered to God for His guidance on how best to use it.And the American government has made separation of church and state very clear. They must, therefore, be consistent. The government has no right to redefine marriage in its holy context. If they stepped in and redefined marriage, a whole bunch of other decisions they've made concerning separation of church and state (removing the flag from classrooms, the commandments from courthouses, etc.) would then have to be reversed. They can't have it both ways, and they know this. Peace."
1,"There are 2 shot and simple points to be made.Firstly, is that there is no need to run a country based on religion, this happened in Saudi Arabia and look at the crime, injustice and autocracy there, quite simply we should run a nation based on what the majority deem to be acceptable, in the case of my country, the UK, gay marriage is acceptable, murder and rape are not.Secondly, people do NOT choose to be gay, scientific evidence shows that people are born GAY, would you not allow a person with dyslexia or downs syndrome to marry? They are born different to us.To sum up, anyone who feels that it is wrong is being over religious and fundamentalist, we cannot let a 2000 year old book with no known author govern the freedoms we have. A simple referendum will fix things."
2,"To respond to your first point: Your argument actually proves God's point where Jesus says there is ""only way to come to the Father, and that is through the person of Jesus Christ""—not Mohammed, and that those in positions of power and authority will be judged more harshly, so that may be what's going on over there? That's not saying that there aren't peaceful and loving Muslims—it's saying that a nation is being ran via Islam by it's governing powers, which, according to Scripture, brings ruin upon itself by dismissing the person and holiness of Jesus and teaching their entire people to dismiss it as well. I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etcetera—oh wait, that would be Heaven. But sin is in the world and a country based on Christ's truth and faith and peace (not religion?) isn't going to happen here on earth. So we do the best we can with a democracy that guarantees protection of religion.Your second point: I know for a fact that some people DO choose to ""be gay"" as one of my friends is newly gay, but didn't used to be, but after one too many hurts by the opposite sex and a desperate need to be cared for decided to give the other side a try. (And it should be noted that we hear each other's views on the subject with respect and agree to disagree but are still good friends.) There's also the perfect illustration of choosing in bisexuals, who can't seem to ""choose"" which sex they prefer. It is a choice in the end, even if it's an inclination one is born with, as I said in my original argument. I don't even begin to know how you came to compare gay marriage to allowing someone with dyslexia to marry? Re-read my original argument about the necessity of marriage being male/female. Marriage is a holy union between a man and a woman—it is not a civil union (although many treat it as such)—and that is why so many people have a problem with legalizing gay marriage. It would erode the foundation and meaning of marriage according to God, which is sacred to believers. You don't want to believe in God—hey, that's between you and Him and every human being has that free choice—no one is forcing or condemning anyone. All that believers are doing is defending their faith-based, holy sacraments so that others can't redefine them when they don't even believe in them. I mean there really is a contradiction there, right? Christians don't marry for financial reasons (at least they're not supposed to) or things like that—it is to pledge the marriage to God, to request His blessing. Let me ask you something: What's wrong with homosexuality being a choice? I mean, if homosexuals are confident and proud of their sexual preference, why the need to say that the trait is inborn? Why all the shame? ""Fundamentalism"" is defined as a strong adherence to any set of beliefs in the face of criticism and unpopularity. I am by no means a perfect Christian, but I am trying to be an authentic Christian and not a casual one, so I guess if that makes me a fundamentalist, then I guess I am? But be careful about labeling when you so clearly and ""fundamentally"" adhere to your own beliefs. Diversity goes both ways my friend. ;)Oh, and Prop 8, was voted down by a democracy, not by religion—the majority deemed it not to be acceptable, to use your own words."
1,"Wow so much ignorance and hypocrisy to address. ""I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etcetera""Please observe the middle ages. That is probably an ideal time for Christians. Gays were killed. No science. Blasphemers were killed. Almost everyone was Christian. But I would hardly call it a time free of crime, pain, and suffering.No one cares what you say your friends said that he thinks. There are so many possible errors in that statement it is mind boggling.A) Your friend doesn't know why he is gay and is trying to come up with a reasonB) Your friend lied to youC) You lied to us.Being homosexual is not a choice. Regardless of the fact that it has been proven not to be as you are clearly ignoring that, why would anyone choose a lifestyle in which they experience intolerance just to sin and piss of god? You guys really need to learn logic.Marriage by the government is not a holy union. In a church it is. And that is what you guys fail to realize. No one is arguing that marriages in churches should be between same-sex couples, you guys can do whatever your magic book tells you. However, according to the establishment clause of the United States Constitution, we cannot base our government off of religion. If we base marriage off of religion, how do we choose which one, maybe my religion says nobody can get married? Even if everyone in the country in Christian, which thankfully they aren't, we still cannot use the bible as justification for public policy, it is not legal.You can mince words all you want, but Christianity is a religion and atheism is not.And proposition 8 was passed by a campaign of fear mongering and large influence by the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints. That's totally irrelevant, however, because it doesn't matter how many people vote for something if it is unconstitutional. You don't seem to be very knowledgeable about the constitution so let me help you. Our system is not set up by majority rules. It is set up by majority rules with minority rights. The minority rights is not an afterthought it is at least as important. The framers of the constitution specifically set up the government to avoid the kind of religious and tyrannical persecution they experienced in England."
2,"The idea that human affairs of importance can be simply based on emotional subjective feelings is the rock on which it founders.Humanity has advanced according to the understanding he has of the laws which govern everything around us ,from the turning of the planets, the cells in our bodies, the plants on the earth.We have learned to understood and use the laws of flight, of engineering etc to bring about advancements in our society.Everything is underpinned by laws and although many people quote the bible they would be better to quote the laws of god as seen in science.When we seriously break these laws we descend.Most of us 'sin by breaking laws which allow us to live and exist and evolve in the universe .At this time the decisions we make will decide if we survive or not as a society into the future .There are narcissistic and sometomes deliberately malign people who hate that they cannot control these laws in a personal wayand they are determined to undermine that which they cannot control. Marriage or the recognition of the law of energy creativity inherent in the polar opposites of male female is neccessary as a force of good energy and must be encouraged .If we passed laws according to what people'felt'and not what is creative and good we would be back in the cave .Since there is no benefit to society one has to ask why 'they' want to get married,perhaps to undermine what they 'hate'.After all if it is simply a social recognition a personal party etc is their free choice. If we go this route with them socety will unwind and that is the main purpose[ concious in most cases]."
1,"Stop trying to sound smart because you come off looking like an idiot. Homosexuality is genetic, and therefore evolved. Look at animals, many species of mammals reptiles and fish have members that are homosexual. How can something be going against nature if it can be found so prevalently in nature?"
2,"This is a pointless and fruitless debate, even though the answer is clear: Yes,   of course   children with same-sex parents are at a disadvantage compared to the children of stable, monogamous, traditional families. Boys learn how to relate to women and girls substantially through their relations with their mothers; girls learn how to relate to men and boys substantially through their relations with their fathers. A same-sex couple is all but certain to under-serve one of these developmental needs.But the question is   still irrelevant.   The proper questions are:1. Are children with same-sex parents disadvantaged in comparison to children who are never adopted?2. Would any degree of disadvantage,   assuming we could measure such a thing objectively,   justify forbidding same-sex couples to adopt children?The answers to these questions cannot be collectivized. The answer to #1 is ""Sometimes; it depends on the adoptive parents."" On #2, there cannot be a satisfying consensus, because we don't know how to measure ""advantages"" and ""disadvantages"" in a way that will both command agreement and satisfactorily control for non-environmental factors. After all, heredity and free will always play a part, and one cannot ""run the experiment"" a second time."
1,"""Homosexuality is genetic, and therefore evolved.""Without looking into this in more detail, my knowledge of evolution is telling me that this isn't right. Homosexuality in humans is generally exclusive. How does exclusive homosexuality become an inherited trait subject to evolution if it is not passed on to a new generation? It may have evolved to a point (as non-exclusive homosexuality is visible in nature), but would have been instantly wiped out as soon as human intellect and emotion took over leading to exclusive homosexuality. I believe homosexuality is a hormonal inbalance, but certainly can't see it as an evolved trait.""How can something be going against nature if it can be found so prevalently in nature?""Homosexuality in nature is not exclusive, so would provide no detremental effect to a species if homosexuality was practised only when no ""straight"" sex is possible. In this instance an evolved homosexual trait may exist, though I'm far more comfortable with the idea of hormonal inbalances as with humans.I may be wrong though. As I say, this just seemed wrong on my current knowledge of evolution. I'll have to seek out some evidence either way before commiting to the ""hormonal inbalance"" view of homosexuality over an evolved trait."
1,"The trait could be passed on if it only manifests in a small percent of the organisms carrying the trait. If there's a gene that randomly causes homosexuality in 10% of it's carriers, and it turns out that homosexuality is a benefit to the population as a whole, then evolution applies. Like the video says, looking at evolution on an individual scale is like looking at one pixel on your monitor. You have to look at the whole thing to get the full picture. An occasional hormonal imbalance leading to homosexuality could be seen as an evolved trait."
1,"""If there's a gene that randomly causes homosexuality in 10% of it's carriers, and it turns out that homosexuality is a benefit to the population as a whole, then evolution applies.""I believe the ""what's good for the group"" model of evolution has been firmly discredited, and is a common misunderstanding of evolutionary behaviour.Firstly, let me address the concept of a gene. What constitues a gene is very subjective, so it is better for us to talk of ""units of evolution"" so we don't confuse ourselves with thinking about genes as a single entity that controls a single operation. Now, in order for homosexuality to be genetic rather than a simple hormone disbalance, we would have to show that there is a significant grouping of genes into a single homosexual unit of evolution, and that this unit of evolution strives to save itself through purely altruistic methods.Now, the general idea of ""what is good for the group"" seems at first to be a possible intepretation of evolution in a larger scale. However, the correct interpretation is what is good for the unit of evolution. Altruistic behaviour appears to be of no benefit to an individual, but obviously the trait to do something altruistic would find it very hard to saturate a gene pool; therefore there is absolutely no benefit in saving another over you. If, however, we think purely at the level of the unit of evolution, then we see that apparently unhelpful behaviours (such as an animal informing other animals of an approaching predetor, whilst also making itself more visible to said predator) can saturate a gene pool if the gene is geared up for saving itself.This means realistically that there are two ways for a unit to saturate the gene pool for a certain unit space; it benefits the individual carrying it, or it causes the individual to benefit other individuals who are most likely carrying the same unit of evolution. As homosexuality lends to a lack of saving ""itself"" (as it wont be passed on), it can only realistically become an evolved trait if it causes altruistic behavior that causes other carriers to be more likely to survive.I know about evolution and I understand all these concepts. The point I'm making is that homosexuality doesn't appear to lend itself to any altruistic behaviour that would benefit people carrying the homosexual unit of evolution. Infact, recognition of other homosexual people in order to better select those to benefit would mean that the other person is also homosexual and therefore less likely to pass on their gene. The main point being made is thus: Altruistic behaviour by a unit of evolution that hunders itself towards units of evolution that also actually hinder their own reproductive potential would be extremely unlikely to saturate the gene pool."
1,I am no biologist so my credibility only extends as far as my source's credibility. In this case my source is the video I linked to which is made by a biology student. I have found all of his videos very informative and factually accurate and therefore find no reason to doubt him. If you want to check out his page here it is.http://www.youtube.com/user/DonExodus2Most of his videos are about evolution and debunking creationist arguments.
2,"i agree, this cannot be ""evolved"" though, i do think it is genetic (will talk about this next).cant be evolved because- according to darwin, we (animals) evolve so that we can survive and have stronger offspring. gays cant have kids, therefor, why would they have ""evolved"" into being gay?is genetic - see my previous arguements"
1,"I can't talk in depth as I'm at work, but suffice to say that is an extremely simple interpretation of evolution.Check out genetic drift.My argument is slightly different. I was actually trying to say that there isn't a ""gay gene."" My intepretation of it is that there is a gene that controls hormone balance during pregnancy, which can sometimes become faulty and cause homosexuality. It is the fault of an evolved gene, but not a gene exclusively causing homosexuality. Hope that clears it up."
1,"from what i understand what happens is during pregnancy a boy baby is considered an alien object and so the body fights it, making it more feminen (i dont remember the source but that was what they said) and that after more kids your body gets better at it and so younger siblings are more likely to be gay?"
1,"That's not really accurate, no. Your body doesn't fight against the production of a male featus. Around the 7 to 12 weeks period, the male featus is exposed to testosterone, which aids in the development of male features and typical male brain development. If this testosterone exposure is in any way hindered, it will cause the male baby to be more feminine.I can't claim to know any reasons why younger siblings are more likely to be gay, unfortunately."
2,"1st. . .the question is not is being gay good, bad or indifferent? It is about gay marriage.For the record I have not one issue with the type, sex, number or racial, religious background of peoples bed, shed or head partners. Consenting adults can consent to anything.So unless someone says ""ew your gay!?"" stick to the subject please and quit reading even more into the topic than you already are. . .Sure let's use the analogy of the animal kingdom. Sure gay relationships abound. . .but how about a gay mated pair? And even so as animals is this going to function for them as a regular mated pair?"
1,"What are you talking about? I was responding to the fact that truthfinder said gay marriage went against ""laws of god as seen in science."" I never stated my opinion as to whether homosexuality was good, bad or neither, either. I was disputing his ideas. Laws should be based on rationality. But how does gay marriage harm anyone? Truthfinder's answer was nonsensical; almost as nonsensical as your questions are. And even so as animals is this going to function for them as a regular mated pair?I can't even respond to that because it makes no sense! From now on, reread what you type and think ""what the fuck am I talking about"" before you press the submit button. Okay?"
1,"By saying""Yes, of course   children   with same-sex parents are at a disadvantage compared to the children of stable, monogamous, traditional families.""you bluntly push the idea that gay couples are not any of the adj's listed above...so gay couples are not stable?  Monogamous? Or traditional (by their standards, not yours)? On what grounds can you say this without any doubt?"" Boys learn how to relate to women and girls substantially through their relations with their mothers; girls learn how to relate to men and boys substantially through their relations with their fathers.

2,"your proof was there are gay animals.so my response would be how many of them that have mated pairs, are gay mated pairs?

1,"I'm pretty sure you didn't understand my point, so allow me to explain myself. Homosexuality is found throughout nature, in numerous species. Therefore, calling homosexuality unnatural would be misleading (at the very least).You are correct that we do not have the same genes as fish. But as I said earlier, homosexuality is prevalent in nature, and therefore must be genetic in all of the species I named (including many mammals, and some primates). Therefore if humans were not born homosexual, then this would make our species an exception.None of this matters however, because we have studied humans, and homosexuality is not a choice. It has to do with a combination of genetics, and hormone levels in the womb."

1,"in case you havent noticed....&gt;there are gay women too, i think they are called lesbians.coughcoughso, yeah, 1) marriage does NOT protect women. it gives men more control over them2) women can marry other women too if gay marriage is allowed so there wont be a shortage of men or what ever you are thinking will keep the women from getting married.3) people did say interracial marriage would hurt ppl, thats why black ppl werent even allowed to look at white women with out getting hung. you know, why back when black ppl were getting their rights?well, same thing, different ppl. wich means 4) interracial marriage is very relevant. 5) if you are worried men hurt women, then why not let men marry men and women marry women? then the men will leave the women alone. DUH"
1,"Wow, you're really grasping at straws here aren't you? Because women are mistreated and female infants are killed in India, we should ban gay marriage? Is this what you're saying? Because, if it is, you're fucking stupid.The issue in India has to do with gender inequality. Gay marriage would actually help the situation for two reasons:1) More homosexual couples would mean more children would be adopted. This means that less female infants would be killed and could but instead could be put up for adoption.2) It would make genders more equal. If a woman can marry a woman and start a family without a man then this empowers women. It means that they don't need men. Honestly I'm pretty sure that I'm not understanding you. Is this a joke? Because I can think of no other reason why you would bring up a completely irrelevant article and say homosexual marriage would exacerbate the problem. Hell, this didn't even happen in America! That doesn't make it any less of an atrocity, but it does make your entire argument irrelevant."

Good job! you are so smart I am awed.
1,"So you're just saying that homosexual marriage will never come to fruition if acts like those occurring in India continue? Does that mean it hurts people? I still don't understand the argument you were trying to make.""there will be no homosexual couples in a world dominated by the women haters""I'm not sure I understand how this goes to prove your point. It seems like you are saying homosexuals and women are in the same boat on this one and progress will need to be made for both. If this is what you're saying then I agree with you. If you are instead saying we shouldn't achieve equality for homosexuals until women are treated as equals around the world, then I would have to disagree. Why should homosexuals suffer as well just because women are treated badly in third world nations.I am not trying to convince you, I am trying to tear down your ridiculous arguments. If I thought you were a reasonable person I might try to persuade you, but clearly you're not...so what's the point?"

Being in a heterosexual marriage I can see the advantages of having parents from different sexes. There are times that I can not connect to one of my children because I see things from a man's point of view. At those times my wife is the one who has a totally different perspective and manages to understand something that I never could. This works the other way around too. The simple fact is that men and women are different and a child growing up needs both points of views to be able to make good balanced decisions.I'm sure children with same sex parents will grow up well enough to become very good citizens but my beliefe is that they are at a disadvantage and have to learn things the hard way."

2,articulated my butt off. . .and I did not bring in name calling.none so blind as those who will not CI am bored now.
2,"Gay marriage by itself probably doesn't. Gay marriage as it is being lobbied for takes away the First amendment rights of many americans. States which have passed these laws immediately begin teaching children that it is ""ok"" and even ""good"" to be gay. Some people just don't believe this, and they have that right! You have a right to believe the sky is purple and you have a right to teach that to your children! You have a right to teach your children that black people are evil and gays are going to hell. Are you a stupid bigot? YES! but you do have that right!I have no problem with gay marriage, I do have a problem with the invasion of people's rights to believe that gay union is wrong. I also do not believe that marriage is a constitutional right, so gay marriage would have to be approved by a majority of voters in order to be obtained (and not in a courtroom!). If all of this happens, great! Just don't take away the rights of those who are religious to believe gay union is wrong."
1,"So let me get this straight. As long as a majority of people oppose someone else's right to something they themselves enjoy, that wronged person has to wait until the majority get with the program, and then and only then, does he get to enjoy what everyone else is enjoying? Huh? The religious right can and do believe anything they want, no matter how stupid and obnoxious and irrational it is. They can and do teach their kids whatever nonsense they care to.My right to equal protection under the law - my right to enjoy the same tax breaks, visitation rights, and property inheritance rights everyone else has - does not in any way interfere with that. How do you conceivably justify this denial of my rights under the same constitution and under the same tax code, with whatever minor challenge to someone's religious beliefs there could possibly be?This is like denying rights to African Americans or Hispanics because the KKK has issues with it. That wouldn't stand for a second. Why am I any different?No one is challenging any one's right to their beliefs here. But as a taxpaying American, I most certainly DO demand the same rights as you enjoy.Let's be perfectly straight here: no one is asking a church to perform a same sex wedding. Most people who are gay wouldn't step foot in a church to begin with because there is so much hate there. As Ghandi said, ""I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. They are so much unlike him.""There are plenty of Christian churches that love and accept us that no one would ever bother for one moment thinking about going into one of the palaces of hate that so many churches have become. So how in heaven's name does that interfere with your religion?My own Episcopalian church couldn't possibly be a more warm and inviting place for gay and lesbian people. I love it there. It has allowed me to grow and thrive as a Christian. The old Baptist church I was raised in was a spiritual killing field. What kind of idiot would go back there for any reason?"

But my favorite is the one that says you're allowed to beat your slave to death so long as it takes longer then a day..."
2,"Two rebuttals here i'd like to offer:1) research about homosexual couples being better parents or that homosexuality is genetic. I'm sorry, but neither of these things are proven facts, and there is a lot of controversial research on both sides of the aisle. I think both sides should be able to agree here that neither side has been proven. I know, I know, you can show me 100 studies that say the above is true, but guess what, I can show you 100 studies that say the opposite and then we just get into the ""who's study is better"" thing, and it's just a waste of time. Many things can be conclusively proven. These are not yet in that category for either side. Besides, for all the ""studies show"" comments above, no one has cited a single one. I find the funniest thing about such studies is that everyone has heard of them and is sure something has been shown conclusively, but no one is quite sure when or where.2) the adoption thing is really irrelevant I think. In this country there aren't hordes of orphans wishing for parents to adopt them. This is a myth taken from the situation some time ago. Walk into an adoption clinic, things have really changed. It's not easy to adopt. Now outside of this country things are very different I know, but I still don't think gay marriage is going to significantly impact this. Feel free to disagree with me here, I just really think this is a seperate topic. Oh, and if you disagree, I think you will see that studies show I'm right ;)(I'm kidding in case you didn't catch that) :)"
2,"Yes, unfortunately that is democracy. The constitution gives us certain basic rights. If we want more we can pass laws to make more by majority vote or through our elected representatives. If those rights violate the constitutional ones, the courts can overturn them. If this happens the people can amend the constitution to pass the law anyway.The constitution didn't give anyone the right to marry. People have passed laws allowing marriage between a man and a woman. These laws apply equally to all, so equal protection isn't violated (I'm sorry, you have just as much a right to marry a member of the opposite sex as anyone else). If you don't like it, you vote to change the laws.That's democracy. It's not perfect, but it's the best thing out there!Oh, and it's not the same as civil rights, and if I was black I would be horribly offended by such a comparison. They were fighting for basic human rights which had been denied them. They were being killed, and denied work opportunities and the right to vote. Homosexual's aren't being denied anything (that isn't already denied to everyone else in the country). They just aren't getting what they want."

1,"Alex, thanks for voting ""no"" on prop 8, but as to your personal feelings about which of you - you or your wife - is best suited to answering questions from your children on various topics, this does not constitute valid evidence that children raised by same-gender parents are disadvantaged as opposed to children of opposite-gender parents.  There are many times I refer my children to their other parent to answer certain questions or address particular topics.  There are also many times when she does the same to me.  We each have individual areas of expertise, and individual areas of responsibility within the family.  This is not something unique to heterosexual couples, nor is it necessarily gender-specific.  There are many men (even heterosexual men) who might gravitate towards some ""traditionally feminine"" areas of expertise, and vice versa for women.  Getting hung up on which parent has which sort of genitalia ignores the fact that all of us are different and bring different skills, abilities, perspectives and interests to our relationships and to our parenting.Evidence clearly demonstrates that same-gender-parented kids are equally happy, healthy and well-adjusted as compared to their opposite-gender-parented peers.  Try not to get hung up on the physical appendages or lack thereof, and focus in on the fact that we are all human, all individuals, and all have a great deal to offer our children as parents."
2,"I don't know that I'd argue that it hurts everyone per se, but I definitely think there's something to be said for the argument that homosexuality hurts homosexuals. See, most of the opposition to homosexuality on the part of religious people isn't bred of hate, it's bred of love and concern that A) the homosexual lifestyle is inherently sinful according to the Bible and B) that there are certain health concerns, such as AIDS, which in the U.S.--despite gay-rights activists proclaiming, ""it's not just a gay disease!""--is mostly spread through male-male sex or women who have sex with a man who also has sex with men. And also needle-sharing."

1,"Separation of church and state - idea that the government and religion should be separate, and not interfere in each other's affairs. In the United States, this idea is based on the First Amendment to the US Constitution, which states that the government cannot make any laws to establish a state religion or prohibit the free exercise of religion.(source)Banning gay marriage because the Bible says it's wrong is tantamount to establishing Christianity as a state religion."
1,"If your username is a reference to Isaac Asimov, I'll have you know you are exactly the kind of person he disliked. A) Well shopping at walmart may be inherently sinful according to someones religion. What is your point?B) It is mostly spread through unprotected sex. Just because more heterosexual couples use protection to avoid pregnancy and therefore have a lower incidence rate of aids, does not mean it is a gay disease. Gay or straight sex is not the issue, it is whether or not you use condoms. And speaking of your beloved bible, although you may not be Catholic, the pope's recent statement that condoms do not work and make the aids epidemic worse is going to directly cause the deaths of thousands of people."
2,"Yes, gay marriege hurts everyone. Because the government is giving consent to homosexuality. Because most of our children go to puclic schools they are taught to trust Ceaser. They grow up thinking that the government is on their side and all policemen are nice and then they get jobs and taxes are cut from their check and they go ""what?"". But the point is that most Parents don't want their kids going to the mall and see mr and mr Smith. Its traumatic for a child to see two men or two women kissing. But when the government that hey've been told to blindly trust and pledge their alleagience to (bleh!!) sends teh message that this kind of behavior is normal then it creates a rift between the parents' raising of their child and the governments message."

2,"My dear Baba, as a scientist in a different field, I can tell you that there has not been enough time to come up with a scientific proof either way. Besides, I did say that the children from homes with same sex parents will grow up and become very good citizens. But that's not the point. Just like the kids growing up in certain areas like East LA, Compton etc are at a disadvantage but can grow up to become the president of the united states. But the disadvantage is still there and those kids will either have to work harder to learn what is a given to the kids with opposite sex parents or they may never get to know certain realities until they get married to the opposite sex and discover a whole new world.Another point many of us forget is that science is not everything. When it comes to emotions of a human being, or the behavior of a child science has a long way to go. There are 1000s of therapists trying to help people but they admit that help comes from within, therapists (who could be the scientist in this case) ca only give opinions. no facts involved. This is not Math or Physics, it's feelings. Finally as a father I know facts about my children that no doctor, psychiatrist or scientist could tell me. It's not a matter what I can answer or my wife can. It's the difference between a femail sensitivity and that of a man's that makes my wife and I a perft team to deal with our children's emotional needs."

2,"Nice try at a cut and past job, but your argument does not hold water as the analogy between interracial marriage and homosexual unions does not carry over.As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented. Indeed it is unprecedented everywhere in the history of the world. This is quite unlike interracial marriage which has been practiced in many times in many places throughout history, and in most cases without any special legal opinion on the matter. Homosexual unions are different and are new in their established recognition under law.But that aside, i would point out that my original argument was addressing the issue of the curruption of language, and of the importance of preserving the long standing meaning of words, especially when there are no easy alternatives; such as in the case of the word ""marriage"". By attempting to broaden or slightly redefine the meaning of a word, you neccessarily dilute its original meaning.If proponents of non-sex-specific unions had rallied for civil unions, or same sex unions recognition under the law, we would not be having this conversation. What proponents of the phrase ""gay marriage"" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority. This is form of calculated aggression against long standing traditional meaning of language, and should not be tolerated by a civil society.In this Republican form of government, the minority should be protected from the majority, but the majority should also be protected from the minority. Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!When language is eroded by degrees, then it ceases to have meaning; communication, and even thought itself become impossible. And society is brought unto a state of total decay and ruin. What once were men are then little more than animals. Read a page out of Orwell's 1984. The government's new speak is double ungood."
1,"""As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented.""First result on google: ""The first country to allow same-sex couples to enter into legally recognized marriage was the Netherlands, effective in 2001. Since then, six other countries and seven U.S. states have followed suit, though voters in California revoked it through passage of Proposition 8."" I wouldn't call that unprecedented. If you are going to make a strong claim such as something has never been practiced, you should be sure you actually know what you are talking about. Therefore as I said using traditional marriage as an argument against same-sex marriage is just like using traditional marriage as an argument against interracial marriage.And your argument about language was really just wordy, vacuous, pseudo-intellectual babble. Words and language change over time. This is a natural phenomenon. Cultures are not stagnant. Marriage used to be between a man and the women he bought essentially. Society changes. This does not equate to a destruction of language.""What proponents of the phrase ""gay marriage"" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority.""You mean, just like interracial marriage? If you can't see the comparison, I'm really sorry.""Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!""Yes because the LGBT movement trying to gain civil rights is exactly like the Nazi regime.I don't think you read 1984 very carefully if you think anything in it can be applied to being against same-sex marriage.And I find no logical pathway for how same-sex marriage could lead to ""a state of total decay and ruin."" That's some class A fear mongering right there. Do you work for NOM?"
2,"Addressing your first point, of course there are modern developements in calling legally recognized relationships between same sex couples ""marriage"", that is why it is worth debating, whereas as little as ten or twenty years ago it was not. I was speaking in the broad scope of human history, and in that great span, this misapplication of the more traditional term of ""marriage"" to some form of relationship between a couple who are of the same sex IS new and IS unprecedented, particularly noteworthy is the use of the law as a weapon to force the new definition of the word ""marriage"" on everybody else against their consent in the name of equality and liberty for all.I assure you words DO have meaning, and pondering that meaning is neither ""vacuous"" or ""pseoudo intellectual"". Some of the greatest intellectuals of Western Civilization are on my side on this one. Descarte, Aristotle, Newton, poets like Shakespeare, and Thoreau (who has been speculated as being homosexual by the way) all poured over the fine nuance and meaning of the words they used. And we have benefited greatly from them.Of course the meaning of words change over time, but the underlying reality does not. Some words are reaplied to have new meaning, but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature. The same bird is called by different names in different languages; and while some words may change faster than others, changing the word does not change the bird.Any culture that values its heritage will naturally want to defend that culture from uncontrolled change including its own language, and it is natural and good that it should do this it is the practice of a form of social self preservation. This may sound academic, but it is not! It is exactly what is practiced by the government in French Canadia. They censor and conrol their printed media, street signs, and advertising billboards so as to assure adherence to the standard French language in word use and spelling. This may seem outlandish to the provintial mind, but begs the question...why do they do it? Because they value their own culture.I do not venture to put myself on the side of government cencorship of all printed media, but surely our American society if it values its own cultural heritage at all, must atleast protect its language within the confines of the written law.If sufficient demand for civil unions passes the standard of civil debate and law, that is fine. But no equivelant forum exists for the passage of redefining the meaning of words. Unlike in French Canadia, there are no language police. As law is nothing but the accumulation of words, the manipulation and steady curruption of those words will lead to the destruction of those laws original meaning, either in word, or in practice as those ignorant of the past will be unable to understand the true meaning of the words as they were intended.This is not hypothetical. The Spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered Aztec subject's written histories and records for a reason, to bring about the destruction of their civilization.As for interracial marriage, i have already addressed that issue, please read the previous post more carefully.My 1984 reference was about the ministry of Truth, which systematically corrupted the language by deminishing the number of words and broadening each remaining words application, thereby diluting its meaning. The speaker posits this is exaclty what is occuring in the case of legal use of the term ""gay marriage"", for the reasons stated in the primary statement.This speaker did not state ""that same-sex marriage could lead to 'a state of total decay and ruin.'"" The inner statement was taken out of context, see previous argument. Neither has this speaker sought to discredit same sex unions, either in principle or in law. The speaker wishes to make clear the distinction between using the word marriage in the traditional sense and in the new same-sex sense in which it is being applied. Proponents of the use of language of so called ""gay marriage"" would have you believe there is no difference between the two definitions, while simultaneously insisting that their new definition be accepted; which is a contradiction."

Please stop misrepresenting the truth.""Of course the meaning of words change over time, but the underlying reality does not. Some words are reaplied to have new meaning, but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature. The same bird is called by different names in different languages; and while some words may change faster than others, changing the word does not change the bird.""Here's a great example of your meaningless pseudo-intellectualism. ""Underlying reality"" is a meaningless phrase. Try to actually say something concrete next time. If you actually knew anything about language, you would understand what a joke it is to say that saying marriage is also between a man and a woman is a drastic change to language. Why don't you take a look at the archaic words and archaic definitions that are no longer used and then talk to me about drastic change. This change of the terms of marriage is incredibly slight. Yours is one of the worst arguments against gay marriage I have heard. At least Christians saying it goes against their holy book is factually correct, even though this is legally and philosophically incorrect. Merriam-Webster's definition of the word ""marriage"" includes same-sex marriage by the way.""This may sound academic, but it is not!""At least you have one thing right.""This may seem outlandish to the provintial mind, but begs the question...why do they do it? Because they value their own culture.""I like when people deliberately use bigger words in a condescending way to sound smart and then spell them incorrectly. It tickles my irony bone.And your argument if I can call it that about government censorship is lame. The fact that another government does something is not justification for it. I will spare you the holocaust analogies because I am still hoping you are intelligent enough to see now how stupid your point is.""The Spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered Aztec subject's written histories and records for a reason, to bring about the destruction of their civilization.""Oh my gosh you have uncovered the LGBT movement's secret plot. Their plan must have been to destroy civilization by destroying our language by making civil rights apply to them thereby changing the language. Blast those sexual deviants. Good thing you solved the mystery Nancy Drew."
1,"You should not deride another's love as unworthy without a damn good reason. Semantic bullshit is not a good reason.Your argument in nothing but thinly veiled gay bashing.That said, allowing gays to marry does not radically redefine marriage. You just flip the gender of one of the participants. Everything else stays the same."
1,How many years of study are needed to evaluate whether children raised by same-gender parents are essentially equivalent by standard measures of health and psychosocial wellbeing to their opposite-gender-parented peers?
2,"I have not ""derided another's love as unworthy"" as you claim.My argument is not ""nothing but a thinly veiled gay bashing."" as you claim. I have used only logic and reason in my arguments. You're statement on the other hand is tantamount to calling me a gay basher; it is slander and it is libelous, it is personally hurtful and i would ask that you refrain from ad homonim attacks, and confine yourself to the more respected tools of argument.If you believe that i am a ""gay basher"" then i say you have me confused with someone else.In any event, i would ask that you not resort to personal attacks, especially when this is a forum for arguing for or against a particular question, and this does not necessarily reflect ones personal views but is an exercize in public debate methods, as I'm sure you are aware of."
1,"""I have not ""derided another's love as unworthy"" as you claim.""Yes you have, all who campaign against gay marriage are essentially making that statement.""this does not necessarily reflect ones personal views but is an exercize in public debate methods""Well if you're just playing Devil's advocate, then I apologize for calling you a gay-basher.But consider the effects of your words: Neocon sheep are liable to skim through your argument, nodding their heads without understanding, thinking that there is some kind of rational justification for their hateful beliefs. We can't have that.Oh, and you seem to have overlooked the last paragraph in my previous argument. No ad-hominem there."
2,"It hurts families, the more gay marriage the less families there will be, children need a mother and a father to look up to."
1,Jake So how does it hurt you personally? What you have said is a moral thing...not an actual hurt. I know plenty of people that have grow up with out a parent and it didn't hurt them a bit. Some on...try again but lets hear how it hurts on a personal level without the moral issue.
2,"Oh, it doesn't hurt me, don't you worry. It only hurts them because it lessens their chances of getting into heaven by, lets say, allot! And that is an actual hurt, maybe not right now but eventually the consequences will come. Yeah immorality can hurt you very, very badly. Allot of people are in denial about this. (;"
1,So you're basing your arguments off of christian mythology?
2,Can you prove that it is mythology?
1,"Pfft, can you prove that it's true?What you're doing here is that you're moving the burden of proof over to me, a common mistake that theists make.Here's your argument, except from a different angle:Can you prove that the beliefs from the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster are mythology?"
2,"Why from a different angle? Why cant you answer my question the way it is? My answer to you is no, I can't prove to you that my religion is true, but I can tell you that I know that it is. Its not so much about what's true or not, but about how you live your life and the choices you make."
1,"""I can't prove to you that my religion is true, but I can tell you that I know that it is.""No, you don't ""know"" that Christianity is right, you have faith in Christianity.Knowledge has a rational foundation.Faith is unfounded and irrational.The problem with faith is that when people of two different faiths conflict, how do we decide which one is right? If you have faith in Christianity and another person has faith in Islam, how do we decide who is right? We can't, because neither belief has a rational foundation."
2,"Before I go any further please note that I'm talking about being at a ""disadvantage"" and not that they're not going to be equivelant. As for the number of years needed, well lets see. I don't know if there's ever really been a real study about this. As a SIMPLE scientific test, I would be getting at least a 100 samples of each group. 100 from same gender parents and 100 from heterosexual parents. I would then devide these into groups of 10. These groups would be of the equivelant social standing. ie 10 middle class families of each group, 10 of minority groups of the same standing, 10 of groups with siblings and 10 with no siblings and so on until major groups of families are represented. This would be a simple experiment otherwise a lot more than 100 from each group would be needed.Then we would study these children and compare as they grow up, go to school, middle school, high school, college, University. We would continue as they get jobs and begin the journey of life. The study would continue when they get married, their marriage would be studied. Their behavior with their spouses, and when they have children how they treat and deal with their children. This would have to continue until they're about 60 years old. The data would constantly be compared and only then we MAY have some kind of an idea of how these children were Influenced, disadvantaged or not. Many scientific studies which involve human behavior have taken generations of scientists who inherit the study from previous scientists who spent a lifetime studying certain people.Now you know why I said there can not be aby scientific proof as yet, since the adoption policy by the same gender parents has not been out for long enough time.Again let me reiterate that I'm not saying we shouldn't let same gender partners adopt children or have custody of children, but what I am saying is that those children are at a disadvantage. "
1,And that's why we live in a secular society that bases it's laws off of rationality and not religion.
1,"""...bases it's laws off of rationality and not religion.""At least we hope so... and want it to be so... but is it really? I don't think that some people do want this at all!"
2,What about people that have think that god doesn't exist. Because they don't know that God doesn't exist. Can we decide they are right? We can't decide these things for ourself based on other peoples beliefs. It is important to find these things out for ourselves. How do you know that I don't know. Why can't I have faith and knowledge. The truth is you need both.
1,"I don't know whether God exists or not. I think that question is impossible to answer because I think it is impossible for us to know anything about the stuff outside of our own universe.Because it is impossible know anything about the initial forces that created the universe, it makes no sense to say that God was that force. And even if we do assume that God created the universe, it makes no sense to jump from there to saying Christianity is right and all other religions are wrong.This isn't just some personal belief. This is the only rational conclusion."
2,So do you admitt that you don't know if I am right or wrong?
1,"Yes. But seeing as how the Chrisitan God is just one of an infinite number of possible explanations as to the origin of the universe, I'd say the probability that you are correct is practically zero."
1,"Says who? Do you think making gay marriage illegal means there will be less homosexuals? Don't you think that an orphan would rather have homosexual parents rather then no parents at all? Have you even ever met a family with homosexual parents? Unlike you, I have. They were actually a lot better adjusted then most people I know who have straight parents. I'm not sure why your so homophobic Jake, but I think maybe you need to be a little more open minded."
2,"""Do you think making gay marriage illegal means there will be less homosexuals?""No, thanks for asking, don't know where you got that idea."
1,"""It hurts families, the more gay marriage the less families there will be""Well what did you mean by this statement? How does gay marriage being legal mean less families?"
2,Meaning that children will start to see it as normal and choose to be gay. How many times I'm a gonna have to tell you this?
1,"Alex, you are completely bypassing the fact that children have been raised by same-gender couples for far longer than there have been adoption policies to place adoptive children with such couples.  Thousands and thousands of children have been raised by couples who brought up children from a previous marriage or relationship by a member of the couple, or by couples who intentionally got pregnant as a couple, or who brought up the unwanted child of a friend or family member without benefit of being able to adopt him or her, just as ""declared guardians"" of the child by permission of the biological parent.There have been formal studies in place on gay-parented families since the 70's, and further data is available on people raised by same-gender parents since long before that time (I know a few of these people, myself, none of whom happen to be gay, by the way).  They are happily married to people of the opposite gender, and raising children of their own, who are normal and well-adjusted as far as I can tell (some are teenagers, so ""normal"" and ""well-adjusted"" are relative terms! :) But really, they are good kids by any measure).So, while I'm happy to hear that you don't oppose same-gender couples adopting children, it's odd that you feel the need to come here and add fuel to the fire against gay couples raising children without being aware of the body of evidence which consistently supports the fact that children raised by same-gender parents ARE equally healthy and well-adjusted as compared with children of opposite-gender parents."
1,OH good grief How close minded can one nutter be? Someone that chooses to be gay does it on their own one way or the other. Its not your business who someone finds attractive or falls in love with.
2,"How exactly, am I being closed minded? I think im pretty open minded, im not just going with the mediaflow like most of you ""nutter""s are."
1,"The ""mediaflow""? You think that we all feel this way because the media told us to? Wow... that is quite an insult! I just know to treat everyone fairly."
2,"How exactly, am I being closed minded? I think im pretty open minded, im not just going with the mediaflow like most of you ""nutter""s are."
1,"Because the way you worded your statement shows that you believe that it isn't ""ok"" to be gay as you were apparently scared of children thinking it is ok to be gay. See? You can't even see the way you think clearly yourself. Gay people are the way they are. They aren't an aberration or a fluke or the consequence of a choice. They are human beings that simply prefer same sex partners AND THAT IS OK."
2,"""the way you worded your statement shows that you believe""Hmm, that doesn't make sense. If I say something does that mean that I believe it? No."
1,"What? So are you just admitting to talking out of your ass? Yes, if you espouse a belief I will believe that you believe it as a general courtesy of not thinking you a constant liar. If no one can believe your words at face value then there is no point ever debating you again as you just outed yourself as a nihilist, one who believes in nothing. Saying you think it's wrong for children to think being gay is ok says a lot about you. If you don't believe that then be more clear in your posts, because you seem constantly out of your depth on this site my friend."
1,"Sorry Jake. i don't want you to feel like you're being picked on or ganged up on. Some of these people have really pissed me off and that's not easy thing to do but I have to side with them on this issue...... but only to point. After that, I'm back to fighting them. There's a fundamental difference in their argument that just sets me off."
1,Thanks for at least trying to be a little bit nice. These people need to lighten up a little bit.
2,"Jake, why should anyone lighten up? You're doing a pretty good job venting your point of view, why shouldn't others?"
1,"I note that you make a dinstinction between ""equivalency"" and ""disadvantage.""  I am hard-pressed to see where ""equivalent"" parenting equals ""disadvantaged.""  The only disadvantage I see for children of same-gender parents has to do with outside prejudice, such as their parents not being able to protect them with full and equal civil rights because some folks very selfishly want to claim the word ""marriage"" as their own exclusive belonging.  This kind of prejudice is what disadvantages children of same-gender parents, not the genders of their parents."
1,Thanks for understanding ;)
1,"I'm not at all certain that is correct Jake. The estimate on the number of gays vs. straights in this country is about 10%. It may well be more, but the family structure has been maintained thus far in the world and will probably remain so. Yes, I would agree that any child needs a Mom or Dad to look up to and it is easier when there are one of each, however, I believe studies have shown very few, if any, bad affects have been realized from a two mom or two dad household. As long as there are members of the other sex around to give the child balance that's all that's really needed."
1,"The problems a child has being raised by gay parents is NOT from the parents themselves, but the horrible way those kids are treated by kids and others who are raised by heterosexual parents. That is the sad data..."
2,"Kirstie, Fact is Kids are cruel. If its not gay then they are cruel bout those who are tall, fat, thin, short, have curly hair, don't have the latest clothes. Point is kids are always going to find something to pick about. I was picked on because I was adopted and my parents weren't my ""real"" parents so I must have had something wrong with me. Then when they got tired of that it was my weight, then my height, then who I dated. Having gay parents isn't going to change anything for a kid being teased by children raised by close minded parents."
2,"Yea, before long strait kids will get picked on just for being strait. 0:"
1,Does the truth hurt you that much?
1,"Let's just say that 5 years ago when I married my husband, homosexual marriage was legal... this would have had absolutely no effect on my choice to get married to him! Why do you say that there would be less families? How do you define a family? People who care for each other? There are thousands of kids in orphanages all over the world who would be a billion times better off being raised by 2 homosexuals than left in the orphanage! I agree with you that we all need a male and female role model to look up to, but this does not have to be a biological parent!"
2,"I didn't say that it would affect anyones choice on if they are homosexual, or who they marrie. I define a family as a mother and father who love each other(not just care for each other) and for their children. Also, parents are more than just role models.""There are thousands of kids in orphanages all over the world who would be a billion times better off being raised by 2 homosexuals than left in the orphanage!"" -says who!? a billion times, please"
1,"So you define a family as ""a mother and father who love each other(not just care for each other) and for their children."" What happens if the father dies in Iraq? Are they no longer a family? There are thousands of families all over the world who do not fit this definition and still raise healthy and happy children!"
2,The majority of the happy and healthy people are raised by a mother and a father. And if one of them dies they are still a family. I believe that families can be together forever and that death is not the end.
1,"Can you juts give examples of what kind of things that   kids   raised by homosexual parents would struggle to understand but which kids raised by heterosexuals would find a given!?At the centre of your argument is this disturbing assumption that kids raised by heterosexuals are just better, more balanced in their general deminure, that the homosexual run household is comparable to a ghetto while the heterosexual run household is automatically more of a suburb and hence kids raised there can more easily become the president of the USA as compared to kids raised by homosexual couples simply because the one parent has a penis and the other a vulva. I also find quite naive and absurdthis this assertion that because we are all male we are locked in a certain mode of uniform thinking, that we have the same way of seeing, analyzing and doing things. I differ with a lot of men in seeing and doing things and incidentally a lot of my thinking and behaviour is inline with that of numeous women, which is just a coincidence because I differ with a lot of women in my thinking and doing in just about the same measure. Individuals and their values make good parents not their genitals and genitals do not predispose people to any set rule in thinking or doing things, popular culture and the roles it assignes to the sexes in rearing   children   maybe but not the genitals of the parents.Thre is nothing that you can say about how heterosexual couples see and do things that you cannot say about homosexual couples when it comes to raising children. The disavantages that kids raised in homosexual homes face are all a result of the very unfounded sense of false superiority and entitlement that kids raised in heterosexual homes have which they inturn get from their parents such as yourself. "
1,"So are you really saying that a child would be better off in an orphanage than raised by a homosexual couple? I really don't believe that, Jake..."
2,"No thats not what I'm saying, that should be left for the kids to decide."
1,"You want a 1 year old child in an orphanage to decide? Why not let them vote, drink, smoke, drive and do other things then... please, they are children and not old enough to make such choices! Plus, do you really think that a child would rather stay in an orphanage than be loved by 2 people in a home where they have family... even if that family is 2 men? I have friends (heterosexuals) who just adopted a 2 year old child because they cannot have kids... that child has some issues, but is so happy to no longer be in an orphanage!"
2,"Every child should be raised by heterosexual parents. Gay couples shouldn't adopt, they are not parents."
1,"What defines a parent? The person who gave an egg and the person who gave the sperm? I have cousins who are adopted and are perfectly normal and healthy, I have those friends I spoke of before who just adopted less than a month ago. These people are all parents regardless of the fact that they did not give birth to these children! This would be no different if 2 gays adapted. I think that being a parent is more about loving and supporting a child than just knocking some woman up! There are thousands of men out there who get a woman pregnant but have nothing to do with the child's life. The way you are defining being a parent this man would be a father... yet has not doing a damn thing other than ejaculate!"
2,Parents are people who are legally married who actually love each other and their children and who stay together. Not just gay sex partners.
1,"You don't really address any of my questions, Jake. I counter your debate and then you ignore the point and go off on a tangent. So you say that parents are legally married... ok, so if there is a divorce those people are no longer parents? If there is a death of a parent? You are defining a family in a very narrow sense. Gay sex partners are not what we are talking about here, but gay ""people who actually love each other and their children and who stay together."""
2,"""ok, so if there is a divorce those people are no longer parents?"" -not necessarily""If there is a death of a parent?"" -no""You are defining a family in a very narrow sense.""Yes, I am because I know that a family is a very important and sacred thing that should not be altered in any way. Family is the most important thing in life."
1,Who says your definition of family is correct? You think that two people who love each other should not be able to adopt merely because they are the same sex? How about single people who adopt?Family is very important. Explain to me why homosexual parents are any less capable then heterosexual parents at raising a child.
2,"""Who says your definition of family is correct?"" Well, ha, alot of people, including the majority of California. ""You think that two people who love each other should not be able to adopt merely because they are the same sex?""Merely because I think that is not how kids should be raised. And im not a big fan of single people adopting.Im not saying that they are less capaple, im saying that its not good for the kids."
1,"The key point that gets missed in the this discussion is that parents aren't the only ones who raise children. I grew up with a single mother, and while she certainly did her best, she couldn't answer all my questions as a boy. That's why I had a grandfather, uncles, family friends, teachers, coaches and others who I could rely on. Every situation is unique (in my case I was likely better off without my father in my home), but I absolutely feel that their collective help but me at no disadvantage. There's no reason to think that the children of same-sex parents couldn't use similar resources. I would challenge you to re-consider if two opposite sex parents really are so necessary. "
1,"What if I thought you shouldn't be allowed to raise kids? Would that give me the right to take away your right to adopt?Unless you have some proof that children of homosexual parents are somehow harmed, then you are just spouting bullshit. I actually know people with gay parents. I would love to see you repeat what you just said to their face."
2,"Well its a good thing for me that I was right about the fact that the U.S. doesn't vote on things that should not be voted on. But, if there was a vote like that then you would be the minority. If I couldn't adopt allot of people wouldn't be allowed to."
1,"2 parents, say the research, regardless of gender. That's the formula for healthy upbringing."
2,Well in the good old day you didn't have to be that specific. It used to be a given that a mother and father is to raise a child.
1,"It used to be a given that the slaves would do the cleaning, too. As long as we're going by the way things used to be, let's choose our mates by raping them in our caves."
2,"Yeah, so prop8 and slavery are pretty much the same thing huh? no, they are not!, why do people keep comparing this to slavery!?"
1,"It's called an analogy, genius.He's saying that basing things on tradition is a bad idea."
2,"Well, it depends on the tradition doesn't it?"
1,"Jake, you are very fond of using the expression, ""How many times do I have to tell you!"" First off that's a very cheeky statement. It a bit presumptuous of anyone to utter those words on subject matter they know so little about. Let me turn the tables though, for just one moment, when I say to you...HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT BEING GAY IS NOT A CHOICE!I have known ""families"" with two moms and two dads. They were very loving families and the children felt that love very deeply...even when the questions came, as they always do. Most of the kids I kept track of wouldn't have traded their upbringing for one second because it taught them things about prejudice, acceptance, being different and being OK with that. They say they would not have had that same opportunity has they been raised by straight parents. All of them are fine and none of them are gay, no matter which gender they grew up with."
2,"I was raised by straight parents, does that mean I havn't had an opportunity to be taught anything about prejudice, acceptance, or being different!? oh and about ""How many times do I have to tell you"" im not sure that i have used that more than maybe once or twice but I am not fond of having to tell people the same things over and over again."
2,"Thank you for your note but the word ""Disadvantage"" is exactly what you were. Instead of having someone at home you had to go to alternatives. That is called ""being at a disadvantage.""Based on that same experience you had, the children that live with same sex parents will have to go o alternatives hence being disadvantaged.Please notice that disadvantage doesn't mean ""not as good,"" it simply means not having the same opportunities.Thank you"
1,"That's one of your problems Jake...You tell people...you don't reason it out or even back it up with facts, statistics or anything else of value. You are completely homophobic Jake, face it. The possibility of this being a viable relationship is so foreign to you that you believe a child would be ruined by being a part of that relationship. Homosexuality is not a disease my friend...it's a way of life that was given those of us who are. No one should be punished because of it."
1,"Copy and paste from an earlier debate like this.People are born gay.Not just people, pandas, swans, monkeys, and every other mamal in the world has a percentage of its population that is gay. linkIf one were to argue that being gay is a choice, they would also have to argue that two male swans who are gay, are choosing to be gay.So please, find me a swan that is making a conscious decision anywhere. Animals work on instinct, they don't make ""lifestyle choices."" Now, people for the most part aren't slaves to instinct. But we have it, just like animals. If one, like the gay swan, has gay instincts, there are 0 logical reasons they should not pursue it. Infact, not being gay if you're gay leads to mental and physical health problems.To answer Pyg's new twist on this arguement.One could argue that there are too many people, and homosexuality is a good thing in this case.Regardless, there's really no end game here. People who are gay have no choice in the matter, and a gay person can and often is born from two not gay parents. Plus there's every level of gay. Human sexuality looks like a bell curve, it's not really even an either or situation. Though most fall pretty heavily on one side or the other, or at least claim to.If not a single gay person were to pass on their genes to the next generation of humans, still the next generation of humans would have a similar percentage of gay members."
1,"I don't mind being down voted generally, especially if I'm being an ass, have tons of grammar errors, or if someone is arguing against my points.But a down vote on a post like this with no rebuttal is kind of ridiculous."
1,"Not if you're gay it isn't...lol! Seriously john, this has been asked 10 times in the last 6 months. There is so much information out there on the subject it will make your head spin. Homosexuality is a very bad thing in a straight world due to the pre-conceived notions and prejudice that is just glaring. I am gay, which most people on the site are aware of and I can tell you that no one in their right mind would CHOOSE this as a lifestyle. It's much easier to be straight in this society...but imagine what it would be like for you if the positions were changed and the majority were gay, but you liked women! You cannot help what you were born to be and to live any other way would be an injustice to you and all you are. No...it doesn't have to be a bad thing, but people do try and make it so."
1,"I understand you're just playing devil's advocate; however I still find the need to correct you. Homosexuality is an evolved trait. If a species has a certain percentage of their population born homosexual, then they are more likely to survive. In addition, animals of some species produce more offspring if they have a younger sibling that is homosexual. That is why we see homosexuality so prevalent in nature.This video explains all of this in much better detail:"
1,"Brilliant clip.I did not know that relatives of homosexuals tend to have more kids (the male ones at least.)But is that based on observation only?I'm confused why that would be true. Did you find anything that offered a genetic or social reason?It's seems the number of kids one has would have more to do with how many times they have sex without a condom, more than anything.What about having a gay relative would make one more likely to participate in unprotected sex more often? If it's a simple fertility issue... again I'm flabergasted. That would suggest that the ability of one to have kids is reversely proportional to their genetic propensity to only have gay sex...I just had a thought.Following that the relatives of gays have more kids,it would stand to reason that that is the reason why, while gays themselves tend not to pass on their genes, the percent of gays stays static.So then, things like viagra, and fertility clinics would essentially lower the percentage of people who are gay.This assuming1. relatives of gays have historically and presently been less likely to need outside help reproducing.2. those who historically had more trouble having kids did not have any gay relatives, thus perhaps slightly less likely to have gay children, and now are able to have more kids, where in the past they could not.Not sure what my point is, but it interests me for some reason. I wonder if in 10 years we'll see a decline in the percentage of gay people, and we'll stand around scratching our heads why, while the religious take it as proof of god's disaproval."
1,"I couldn't find one on why having gay siblings increases the number of offspring, but I did find a study that shows that people with older brothers are more likely to be gay and this one.I'm curious about that too, but if I had to make a very uneducated guess...think about how gay guys stereotypically go shopping with girls. Well if your younger gay brother keeps bringing around girls, then that might increase your chances of getting laid. A very complex scientific explanation, I know, but I'm just guessing."
1,"lol, I like your logic,now I wish I had a gay brother."
1,"Wow, throwing in Intelligent Design...you're just trying to piss me off now aren't you ;).Actually you are looking at evolution on a very limited scale (i.e. individuals evolving). Looking at humanity over the past hundred thousand years you can see that we are social creatures. Therefore, we have not evolved as individuals, but in small groups. In fact, this same process describes how we developed morals. Those societies whose members didn't kill each other survived better. In times of need societies whose members worked for the common good, and didn't make selfish decisions that hurt the group, lasted longer. I tend to be a critic of religion, but those societies that developed religion were able to last longer then those that didn't have traditions for the same reasons.But I digress...Individual homosexuals help the group as a whole to survive better. Therefore if we look at evolution of groups of individuals, and not of the individuals themselves we see that those groups that had a certain percentage of homosexuals in them would survive and pass their genes along.As usual, no deity is needed."
1,"Okay, I'm pretty sure you didn't understand what I was saying the first time. I will take the blame for this because I probably didn't word it clearly. Allow me to try again.People (and many species of animals) live in groups. People whose groups survive are able to pass on their genes. Those genetic traits which help the society as a whole to survive, are passed along. Therefore, if some homosexuality helps a group to survive and homosexuality is somehow genetic, then those groups with genes that cause a certain percentage of the population to be homosexual, will survive. In this way nature does ""see"" the effect of one person on another.In your second paragraph you argue that complex process, that can only be understood by intelligence, require an intelligent designer. I respect you as a debater, so I will not call your logic fucking retarded. Instead, I will point out that there are many process that exist, which are complicated, but also have natural explanations. The concept of quantum physics is complicated, so is planetary formation and biology...however each of these process has a natural explanation that can be ""proven"" by science. One could argue that all of these things came about by magic...but one may also want to repeat fourth grade science and leave the thinking to the adults.Third Paragraph: I talked about homosexual siblings helping their brothers reproduce. I got this from the video I posted. I have been able to find no other source for it... so I will not claim it to be fact. Nevertheless, as you said, religion helped not because it increased reproduction, but because it was beneficial to the societies survival (i.e. people didn't kill each other). Couldn't homosexuality have the same effect? If a percentage of the population being homosexual bonded the society in some way, wouldn't this be beneficial as well? This has been seen in animal populations.... although obviously not humans.As far as your argument that homosexuality causes a break in the genetic chain, and therefore wouldn't be passed on... please check out these lnks 1 and 2. They both talk about how the more older brothers you have, the more likely it is you're a homosexual. This means that the genes of homosexuals are still likely to be passed on through their older siblings, even though not directly.Finally we arrive at your most offensive argument, where you call homosexuals ""freaks of nature"". I would rage way to hard if I tried to respond to this claim myself, so please check out this site which addresses your argument that homosexuality somehow is a way to stop ""bad"" genes from passing on."

So, to answer your question, no, that's not supposed to happen."

1,"Well, here's how the typical argument goes:""Homosexuality is unnatural, and therefore immoral""Clearly, homosexuality exists prevalently in nature and therefore is, by definition, natural.

2,"Yes I agree. I am an atheist, but according to the bible homosexuality is wrong in ""God's"" eyes. I mean if you want to be gay then go for it, it's your life and your decision, but if you are a homosexual and still believe in ""God"" the you are not living up to your religions standards. I have a Bi girlfriend and I love her with all that I have to offer but I care she is Bi and it saddens me because of her decision. But it is her life and her decision to be with other girls if she chooses, there is NO stopping it. You cannot control someone's life, no matter how hard you try."
1," Gay adoption is better than foster care for children
"
1,"First, that's all the more reason to be more accepting of it and encourage this to be more normal!But secondly, I wonder if there's any research that supports your claim. Children as far as I've seen are not initially hostile towards children of same-sex parents: when they are hostile, it's thanks to the parents being intolerant. Research has shown that children of same-sex couples are happier and more confident, so perhaps it's not as simple as you claim."
1,"I say yes just because homosexuality falls under the same category as lust, doesn't it? I haven't gotten far in the bible (it's so boring) but I'm not aware of anything, yet, about it saying anything bad about man with man. Otherwise, in the world of religion, it's probably a sin, but in reality, not in my opinion, because I don't believe in sins. :-)"
2,Nooooo. Being a homo is just as much a sin as the act itself.

2,It is in a Biblical context. It isn't wrong from the viewpoint of a rationally thinking person.
2,"So Christians aren't rationally thinking people? Jews aren't rationally thinking people? Hindus aren't rationally thinking people? Muslims aren't rationally thinking people? I've got to say, if you believe that, you're probably not a very rationally thinking person yourself."
2,KILL THEM ALL! All homos must die. You gays should just kill yourselves right now to save yourselves the pain of the holocaust you are about to endure.
2,"Gays, no matter how immoral and evil their ways may be, are still humans!! They should at least be allowed long, happy lives if they're going to spend eternity in Hell."
2,Agreed. They will all be hunted down and slaughtered. Those things don't have long to live.
1,"As I know, the God always remind us to live happily and harmoniously with our spouses and the people around us. Therefore, it is not a sin if both homosexual couple can live harmoniously, parallel to what God has reminded us."
2,"I have no objection to same sex marriage. People should be left alone and be allowed to do whatever they think will make them happy as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.I do, however, strongly oppose adoption by same sex couples. In that case, you're taking a unique individual and placing that individual in a situation in which they have no say in the matter.I'll put this question to those with an opposing view: How many of you have ever regretted NOT being raised by a same sex couple? If you were making the choice for yourself, is it what you would have chosen?My parents were divorced when I was 7. There were many times growing up I wished they had stayed together. Never once growing up did it even cross my mind to wish either would find a member of their own sex so the two could raise me together. In fact, I wasn't all that crazy about most of their opposite sex partners.With that said, the greatest advantage comes from growing up in a loving home, with the two people who gave you life in the first place. Anything else is a disadvantage by definition. From there, the argument becomes one of assiging a value to the degree of disadvantage. That's no easy task and involves infinite shades of gray.Never the less, if it's possible to identify the best solution, it should also be possible to say the farther alternate and lesser solutions deviate from the ideal model, the greater the resulting disadvantage.You can say society should be more accepting of alternate lifestyles, and no doubt it should. That does not change the fact that it does not. You can say a child's peers shouldn't haze them for being part of an alternate lifestyle, and no doubt they should not. That doesn't change the fact that they do.It is irrefutable that it is only possible to produce children through heterosexual means. Millions of years of   evolution   has defined heterosexuality as having the highest advantage for every life form higher than bacteria. In the game of survival of the fittest, that's what works best. A child raised with the tools to form a lasting bond with members of the opposite sex has the greatest advantage, by the only definition that matters. It is what works best in terms of both survival of the individual and of the species."
1,"Does anybody actually read philosophy? Does anyone study ANYTHING anymore? First of all, ""sin"" is far too subjective a word to be used in this case. It is easily confused with notions such as right and wrong, good and evil. Sin implies an act prohibited by a particular religion. There are lots of religions. What is considered a sin in one is not in another. What was considered a sin in antiquity is now considered acceptable. If you want to pick and choose your sins, which many people do, fine. Just know that you have done so and be capable of understanding that as well as applying as much meaning as is reasonable to any act. Or, to be clearer, call homosexuality a sin all you want, but remember that wearing clothes of two different kinds of fiber, interacting with women who are menstruating, eating shellfish, doing work on Saturday, and working for a credit card company are also pretty sinful. If you're going to disregard your own sins and focus on the ones you like, fine, just be aware of your choice to do so.As for right and wrong, the major moral systems, like deontology, founded by Immanual Kant, a staunch Christian, really forms no valid argument against homosexuality other than, ""I don't really like it, it's gross."" Well, you know what, I think eating beef is gross, but I'd hardly call it a sin. Let alone Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, founders of Utilitarianism, who have nothing much at all to say about homosexuality.So, is homosexuality a sin? It depends strongly on who you ask and their biases, which they aren't likely trying to control. Is homosexuality wrong? Well, try taking ethics 101."
1,NO!!!! Homosexuality shouldn't be a sin! Its basically being a sinner for being born :P
1,It shouldn't be considered a sin because if it is then we would have to punish them (like give them a good spanking or something) and they would enjoy that way too much ;)
1,"Why on earth would it be? Leviticus? Can you find Leviticus in the Bible if your life depended on it? Christians, I talking to YOU. Do you even know which versus even remotely pertain to homosexuality? Do you bother to even look at the original languages they were written in? Do you realize that Bibles that use the word ""homosexual"" are not accurate, because the word wasn't even invented until the 1890's in Germany, and didn't become part of the English language until well into the 1950's? What, God sent a revision to the editor? Are you nuts? The original language in Leviticus, by the way, is ""men who are soft."" You are on VERY shaky ground when trying to make this entire argument, based on original language in the Bible.Did you know that Jesus himself never said one word about homosexuality? Oh, wait, yes he did, too. Remember the story about the Centurian? No?The one recorded instance in the entire Bible where Jesus ever encountered a gay person was the Centurian story. A Roman soldier - the Centurian - calls Jesus in a crowd and asks him to heal his ill slave - specifically referring to him as his male, sex slave, his lover. (Check the original language.) Jesus' response isn't one of revulsion, but utter praise! When the Centurian says that it is not necessary for Jesus to travel to the lover to heal him, that the lover was healed simply because Jesus said he was healed, caused Jesus to exclaim to the crowd, ""I have not seen this kind of faith in all of Israel!"" Yes, praise for a homosexual's faith, not condemnation of who he was. Explain that.Are you telling me you are more holly than Jesus himself? If He did not judge us, why do you?And speaking of which, how come you never condemn wealth? Jesus certainly did. A third of all the words in the New Testament, and 2/3 of the words of Jesus, specifically say that the wealthy have great problems getting into heaven because their wealth keeps them from God. Yet you never, ever hear evangelicals mention that? Why? Too busy raising money and driving Mercedes?Why this fascination with homosexuality when Christ tells you take care of the poor, care for the widowed and defenseless, and stop judging? Look at the countless times he lambastes the pious religious peoples in Israel. Are you listening? He's speaking to you - I'd suggest you stop worrying about gay people and start worrying about your own plight. There are too many homeless, too many abused, too many isolated and defenseless people who go without one shred of help in this country. THOSE are the concerns of Jesus, not gay people.I dare any of you to tell me that is not the ""gospel truth."""
1,"http://godmademegay.com/Letter.htmThis is Letter to Louise, one of the best studies of the actual words in the Bible - not the English version, the real Bible, in it's actual languages it was written in - as it pertains to homosexuality.Read this. THEN tell me how you think homosexuality is a sin. Very, VERY, thin argument your side is making.Then let me throw a few verses at you about love, your obligation to help the disadvantaged, and your fundamental need to abandon your wealth if you truly seek God.That will make a very interesting session."
1,"From Letter to Louise:Genesis 18:20 to 19:29--The Sodom StorySome consider the sin of Sodom to be same-gender sex, although we are not told in Genesis what Sodom's sins were, only that they were so great that God determined to destroy the city. On the evening before its destruction he sent two angels, in disguise as men, to the city to lead Lot and his family out early the next day. Hospitable Lot invited them to spend the night at his house. During the evening the men of the city surrounded the house and demanded of Lot that he bring the two men out so that they could [19:5]King James Version: ""know them.""Revised Standard Version: ""know them.""New International Version: ""have sex with them.""When Lot refused to bring his guests out, the men of the city were about to break his door down when the angels struck them all blind and the mob dispersed. The next day Lot and his family were led out of Sodom, and the city was destroyed by fire and brimstone from heaven.The Hebrew verb used here, ""yadha,"" ""to know,"" is used 943 times in the OT and only ten times clearly to mean ""have sex,"" then it always means heterosexual sex. The word normally used for homosexual sex is ""shakhabh."" Many scholars believe that in Gen. 19:5 yadha means ""know"" in the sense of ""get acquainted with"" (the city's men may have wondered if these were enemy spies or they might have sensed the city's impending doom and been concerned with what these strangers were doing there) and have several arguments for this, including Sodom's being used as an example of great sin numerous times in the Old and New Testaments with nothing ever said about same-sex sex, and the context of Jesus' references to Sodom (Luke 10:10-13) which seems to imply lack of hospitality as the sin.Other scholars think it was the common practice of showing dominance over and humiliating outsiders by forcing them to take the part of a (an inferior) woman in a same-gender rape.Others think it means ""have sex,"" and point to Lot's offering his two virgin daughters to the crowd if sex is what they want, if they will just leave his guests alone. If this is the right interpretation, it is clearly about violent, criminal, gang rape, something always condemnable.Another thought is expressed by Religion Professor David L. Bartlett: ""This story is certainly an unlikely starting point for a `biblical' understanding of sexual ethics. While the attempted homosexual rape by the men of Sodom is explicitly condemned, the offer by Lot to hand his two virgin daughters over to the violent and lecherous inhabitants of Sodom is related without a word of judgment.""B-2Conservative theologian Richard Hays says, ""The notorious story of Sodom and Gomorrah--often cited in connection with homosexuality--is actually irrelevant to the topic.""B-3There is nothing in this story applicable to our consideration of homosexuality."
1,"Again from Letter to Louise:Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13Revised Standard Version:22 You shall not lie with a male as with a woman, it is an abomination.13 If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death...The King James and New International versions say virtually the same thing.Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 are the only direct references to same-gender sex in the Old Testament. They are both part of the Old Testament Holiness Code, a religious, not a moral code; it later became the Jewish Purity Laws. [""Abomination"" is used throughout the Old Testament to designate sins that involve ethnic contamination or idolatry. The word relates to the failure to worship God or to worshiping a false god; it does not relate to morality.] Professor Soards tell us, ""Old Testament experts view the regulations of Leviticus as standards of holiness, directives for the formation of community life, aimed at establishing and maintaining a people's identity in relation to God.""B-4 This is because God was so determined that his people would not adopt the practices of the Baal worshipers in Canaan, and same-gender sex was part of Baal worship. (The laws say nothing about women engaging in same-gender sex; probably this had to do with man's dominance, and such acts by the subservient had nothing to do with religious impurity.)God required purity for his worship. Anything pure was unadulterated, unmixed with anything else These Purity Laws prohibited mixing different threads in one garment, sowing a field with two kinds of seed, crossbreeding animals. A few years ago in Israel when an orthodox government came into power, McDonalds had to stop selling cheeseburgers. Hamburgers, OK. Cheese sandwiches, OK. But mixing milk and meat in one sandwich violated the Purity Laws--it had nothing to do with morality. These were laws about worshipping God, not ethics, and so have no bearing on our discussion of morality. Helmut Thielicke remarks on these passages: ""It would never occur to anyone to wrench these laws of cultic purification from their concrete situation and give them the kind of normative authority that the Decalogue, for example, has.""B-5Another reason they are not pertinent to our discussion is that these laws were for the particular time and circumstances existing when they were given. If you planted a fruit tree, you could not eat its fruit until its fifth year, and all fruit the fourth year must be offered to the Lord. A worker must be paid his wage on the day of his labor. You must not harvest a field to its edge. We readily dismiss most of them as not applicable to our day and culture, and if we dismiss some of them for any reason, we have to dismiss all of them, including the sexual regulations, for that same reason.When we add the fact that these laws were talking about heterosexuals, it makes three reasons, any one of which would be sufficient, why they have no bearing on questions about homosexuals or homosexuality or on the morality of same-gender sex by homosexuals today."
1,"In the New Testament there are three passages to consider. Romans 1:21, 26, 27Revised Standard Version21 for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him...26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men... The King James and New International versions say virtually the same thing. Romans 1:26 and 27 clearly speak of same-gender sex by both men and women, the only passage in the New Testament that does so. Rom. 1:18-32 speaks of Gentiles (heterosexuals) who could and should have known and served and given thanks to God but would not, so God gave them up and let them do whatever they wanted to do, and that resulted in degrading and shameful acts, including same-gender sex. It is almost a moot point, but Paul is not listing sins for which God will condemn anyone, he is listing sins that occur because people have forsaken Him. These are acts committed by those who have turned away from God and so become ""consumed with passion."" All of us recognize that those who forsake God and give themselves over to lustful living--homosexual or heterosexual--stand condemned by the Bible. This passage is talking about people who chose to forsake God.Conservative theologian Richard Hays says, ""No direct appeal to Romans 1 as a source of rules about sexual conduct is possible.""B-6 I Corinthians 6:9King James Version:9...Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate [malakoi], nor abusers of themselves with mankind [arsenokoitai], 10 Nor thieves..., shall inherit the kingdom of God. New International Version9...Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes [malakoi] nor homosexual offenders [arsenokoitai] 10 nor thieves...will inherit the kingdom of God.Revised Standard Version--1952 edition:9...Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals [malakoi and arsenokoitai], 10 nor thieves..., will inherit the kingdom of God.Revised Standard Version--1971 edition:9...Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts [malakoi and arsenokoitai], 10 nor thieves..., will inherit the kingdom of God.A comparison of how the two Greek words are translated in the different versions shows that translations often, unfortunately, become the interpretations of the translators. In I Cor. 6:9 Paul lists the types of persons who will be excluded from the kingdom of God and for some he uses the Greek words malakoi and arsenokoitai. KJ translates the first ""effeminate,"" a word that has no necessary connection with homosexuals. The NIV translates the first ""male prostitutes"" and the second, ""homosexual offenders"". The RSV in its first edition of 1952 translated both words by the single term, ""homosexuals"". In the revised RSV of 1971, the translation ""homosexuals"" is discarded and the two Greek words are translated as ""sexual perverts""; obviously the translators had concluded the earlier translation was not supportable.Malakoi literally means ""soft"" and is translated that way by both KJ and RSV in Matt. 11:8 and Luke 7:25. When it is used in moral contexts in Greek writings it has the meaning of morally weak; a related word, malakia, when used in moral contexts, means dissolute and occasionally refers to sexual activity but never to homosexual acts. There are at least five Greek words that specifically mean people who practice same-gender sex. Unquestionably, if Paul had meant such people, he would not have used a word that is never used to mean that in Greek writings when he had other words that were clear in that meaning. He must have meant what the word commonly means in moral contexts, ""morally weak."" There is no justification, most scholars agree, for translating it ""homosexuals.""Arsenokoitai, is not found in any extant Greek writings until the second century when it apparently means ""pederast"", a corrupter of boys, and the sixth century when it is used for husbands practicing anal intercourse with their wives. Again, if Paul meant people practicing same-gender sex, why didn't he use one of the common words? Some scholars think probably the second century use might come closest to Paul's intention. If so, there is no justification for translating the word as ""homosexuals."" Other scholars see a connection with Greek words used to refer to same-gender sex in Leviticus. If so, it is speaking of heterosexuals given to such lust they turn to such acts.Richard Hays tells us, ""I Corinthians 6:9-11 states no rule to govern the conduct of Christians.""B-7One commentator has another reason for rejecting the NIV and original RSV translations, ""homosexuals."" Today it could mean that a person who is homosexual in orientation even though ""of irreproachable morals, is automatically branded as unrighteous and excluded from the kingdom of God, just as if he were the most depraved of sexual perverts.""B-8So I Cor. 6:9 says nothing about homosexuality with the possible exception of condemnable pederasty.I Tim. 1:10King James Version:9...the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners,...10...for them that defile themselves with mankind (arsenokoitai)...Revised Standard Version - both 1952 and 1971 editions:9...the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for 10 immoral persons, sodomites (arsenokoitai),...New International Version:9...the law is not made for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful...10 for adulterers and perverts (arsenokoitai)Here only the RSV specifically refers to same-gender sex, using the term ""sodomites,"" which is the translation given in both the Old Testament and New Testament to Hebrew and Greek words for male temple prostitutes. The KJV probably has the same thought. The NIV does not necessarily refer to same-gender sex. Again Paul has used the Greek word arsenokoitai, the word in I Cor. 6:9.As discussed above, this word would have no reference to homosexuality or homosexual sex in our discussion.So like the other two New Testament passages, I Tim. 1:10 says nothing about homosexuality or homosexuals and nothing about same-gender sex unless that of temple prostitutes or possibly the molestation of young boys by heterosexuals.In view of the facts set forth above, we realize there is no moral teaching in the Bible about homosexuality as we know it, including homosexual sex (except possibly pederasty). The Bible cannot be used to condemn as immoral all same-gender sex. It clearly condemns lust, whether homosexual or heterosexual. There is certainly nothing in the Bible about anyone going to hell because he or she is homosexual. All who go to hell will go for the same, one reason: failure to commit their lives in faith to Jesus Christ as their lord and savior. From a slightly different approach to interpretation, Dr. Robin Scroggs states, ""The basic model in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the New Testament that the criterion of reasonable similarity of context is not met. The conclusion I have to draw seems inevitable: Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today's debate.""B-9 [Italics his] Dr. Gomes concludes his discussion of homosexuality and the Bible with these words:The Biblical writers never contemplated a form of homosexuality in which loving, monogamous, and faithful persons sought to live out the implications of the gospel with as much fidelity to it as any heterosexual believer. All they knew of homosexuality was prostitution, pederasty, lasciviousness, and exploitation. These vices, as we know, are not unknown among heterosexuals, and to define contemporary homosexuals only in these terms is a cultural slander of the highest order, reflecting not so much prejudice, which it surely does, but what the Roman Catholic Church calls ""invincible ignorance,"" which all of the Christian piety and charity in the world can do little to conceal. The ""problem,"" of course, is not the Bible, it is the Christians who read it.B-10"
1,"Let me state here and now why I even bother posting any of this.I couldn't care one rat's ass about what any Baptist or Evangelical thinks about anything. I wouldn't darken the door to your home or your church for all of Bill Gates' money. It is my view that the least likely place on Earth I will ever find a person of God is in those two places. End of discussion. The hate and abuse those two camps spew forth is enough to turn my stomach, let alone the hypocrisy and love of power and money their leaders clearly exhibit.I don't care if I ever change your view of anything. Who cares? Stew in your own hatred for all I care. History is against you. We will have our freedom, our rights, and the respect we deserve as gay people. There is no force on earth that will stop that. The younger a person is, the less hate there is. This is a battle you have already lost.What I care passionately about is getting out the word to other lgbt people that there is nothing to fear from the hate mongers that dare call themselves followers of Christ. They are not. They have no more the word of God on their lips than the local village idiot. What I want to say to my lgbt family is simply this: if you would like a church life, if you would like to express your spirituality, there ARE churches out there that love you, embrace you, and desperately want you to be a part of the faith, as you, not one change needed from you.Our hearts and minds are open, and we want you to know that, to be heard above the bigots that have kept you isolated for so very long. Don't assume that the right wing idiots are by any means ""religion"" and that you are excluded. You are not. In many churches - mine most certainly - lgbt people are the life and soul of our congregation and we simply would not exist without their love, compassion, hard work, and devotion.If this is what you yearn for, let no man keep you from it. There is nothing about your sexuality that keeps you from God. Learn it, love it, live it."
1,It may be said to be a sin in the bible but if there is anything I have to disagree with that is in the bible it is that homosexuality is wrong. Has it not been proven that gay people are gay from the get go? Should you have to confess and beg for forgiveness to get into heaven just because you like the same sex?
1,"""Anything else is a disadvantage by definition.""Cool.  Got research to back that one up?  Because I have tons that tell you that you're wrong.Psychosocial Adjustment, School Outcomes, and Romantic Relationships of Adolescents With Same-Sex Parents.  Jennifer L. Wainright, Stephen T. Russell, and Charlotte J. Patterson.  Child Development, 2004, Volume 75, Number 6, Pages 1886-1898.“The small body of research that has focused on adolescent offspring of families headed by same-sex couples includes Huggins's (1989) study of 36 adolescents, ages 13 to 19, 18 with divorced heterosexual and 18 with divorced lesbian mothers.  In this study, Huggins reported no differences in adolescent self-esteem as a function of mothers' sexual orientation.  Daughters of lesbian mothers also had higher self-esteem if their mother had a romantic partner who lived in the home, if their fathers did not display negative attitudes about the mother's sexual orientation, and if they learned of their mother's sexual orientation at an early age.  Huggins also reported that one adolescent with a heterosexual mother, but none with the lesbian mothers, identified as nonheterosexual.” p. 1887“O'Connor (1993) studied 11 young men and women, ages 16 to 23, who were the children of divorced or separated lesbian mothers.  Qualitative findings suggested that participants expressed strong love, loyalty, and protectiveness toward their mothers, and a desire for others to understand the benefits of having a lesbian mother, such as increased sensitivity to prejudice.  Informants, however, described worries about losing friends or being judged by others and their need to keep their mothers' sexual orientation a secret from at least some people external to the family.” p. 1887“Gershon, Tschann, and Jemerin (1999) studied self-esteem, perception of stigma, and coping skills among adolescent offspring of lesbian mothers.  They conducted interviews with 76 adolescents, ages 11 to 18, and examined the impact of societal factors on self-esteem.  The participants had either been born to women who identified as lesbians (25 adolescents) or had been born in the context of their mother's earlier heterosexual marriage (51 adolescents).  Gershon et al. found that adolescents who perceived more stigma related to having a lesbian mother had lower self-esteem in five of seven areas, including social acceptance, self-worth, behavioral conduct, physical appearance, and close friendship.  They hypothesized that the presence of various types of coping skills would moderate this relationship between perceived stigma and self-esteem.  However, their results showed that only good decision making had a moderating effect: In the face of high perceived stigma, adolescents possessing better decision-making skills had higher self-concept in the area of behavioral conduct.”“A slightly older population was studied in Tasker and Golombok's (1997) longitudinal study of young adult offspring of lesbian mothers.  Forty-six young adults, ages 17 to 35, were interviewed in this follow-up to Golombok et al.'s (1983) study of children raised in divorced lesbian mother or divorced heterosexual mother families.  In this generally well-adjusted sample, young men and women who were raised by lesbian mothers were no more likely than those raised by heterosexual mothers to experience depression or anxiety.  Adult children from lesbian mother families were also no more likely than those from other families to have sought professional help for psychiatric problems.  They reported having close friendships during adolescence and were no more likely to remember peer group hostility than were those from other families.  Offspring of lesbian mothers were also no more likely to report same-sex sexual attraction or a gay, lesbian, or bisexual identity than were those from heterosexual families.  They were, however, more likely to have considered a gay or lesbian relationship as a possibility for themselves and to have been involved in a same-sex relationship, suggesting that although sexual attraction and identity may not be related to parental sexual orientation, the likelihood of considering or entering a same-sex relationship may be associated with parents' sexual orientation.” p. 1887"
1,"Homosexuality has been proven to be a result of nature. It is not a choice to be attracted to members of the same sex.For you theists, explain it to yourself how you want, but if there really is a God, he's clearly testing you to see if you've learned the Bible, and he wants you to understand how important it is to accept all his creations in all the shapes, sizes, and forms he sends them."

Have their brains changed?

1,"Do you believe that morality is open to interpretation? That it is whatever a person deems it to be? Or, rather, is it a set of laws that is predetermined, regardless of how many people actually adhere to it?"
2,"I just want to comment about your seemingly rhetorical last question. If it is predetermined then doesn't that imply some kind of nonhuman realm where thought and morals exist, ie God?"
1,"Certainly not (this would make for an excellent debate in itself). If morality is not subjective, which I believe it is not, then the question becomes, does God set moral laws because they are what is moral and right, OR are things that are moral right because God says so. I'm personally of the first opinion, but don't see it necessary to bring God into it at all. Morality does not need God to exist, but with the inclusion, I believe he sets moral laws out because they are right, not the other way around."
1,"“The results of the present study, which is the first based on a large national sample of adolescents living with same-sex couples, revealed that on nearly all of a large array of variables related to school and personal adjustment, adolescents with same-sex parents did not differ significantly from a matched group of adolescents living with opposite-sex parents.  Regardless of family type, adolescents were more likely to show favorable adjustment when they perceived more caring from adults and when parents described close relationships with them.  Thus, as has been reported in studies of children with lesbian mothers (e.g., Chan et al., 1998), it was the qualities of adolescent-parent relationships rather than the structural features of families (e.g., same vs. opposite-sex parents) that were significantly associated with adolescent adjustment (Golombok, 1999; Patterson, 2000).” p. 1895“Across a diverse array of assessments, we found that the personal, family, and school adjustment of adolescents living with same-sex parents did not differ from that of adolescents living with opposite-sex parents.  Consistent with the findings of earlier research (e.g., Huggins, 1989), we found that adolescent self-esteem did not vary as a function of family type.  In addition, we found no differences as a function of family type in measures of personal adjustment, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety; in measures of school adjustment, such as academic achievement, trouble in school, or feelings of school connectedness; or in measures of the qualities of family relationships, such as autonomy, care from adults and peers, neighborhood integration, or parental warmth.  The clarity of results from this broad array of assessments strengthens our confidence that adolescents living with same-sex parents were functioning well in many domains, both at home and at school.” p. 1895Furthermore, consider the following:Mental Health Issues in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Communities. Eds. Billy E. Jones and Marjorie J. Hill.  American Psychiatric Publishing: Washington, D.C., 2002.“Hopefully, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals know that there is no one lesbian or one gay lifestyle or point of view on matters that are important to the parenting of children.  Therefore, any lesbian or gay parent must be given the benefit of an individualized assessment as it relates to her or his lifestyle and point of view and how these might or might not impact on the parent's ability to offer the child permanence, stability, a moral environment, guidance, and a generally healthy upbringing.  Of course, to perform such an assessment, the psychiatrist must be able to integrate accurate knowledge and a sound understanding of parenting and the needs of developing children with an equally accurate knowledge and a sound understanding of gay and lesbian parents.  Similarly, when testifying in child custody and visitation proceedings involving a gay or lesbian parent, psychiatrists must help the court understand that there is enormous diversity within the gay and lesbian community, that the testimony being given is based on an individualized assessment of the particular parent, and that the opinions rendered are supported by the information gathered during the process of the evaluation and by a well-informed body of knowledge that has been used to interpret that information.” p. 46"

2,"Well not bringing religion into the argument lets think logically shall we. Consider this, imagine every couple in the world at any generation in time decided to be homosexual, what would happen? There would be no next generation because homosexuals cant reproduce and if they can it would be unnatural granted i am Christian but i also believe in common logic but we cant very well be fruitful and multiply if we were all in a same sex marriage."
1,that only says whether gay sex is usefull for procreation - nothing about its morality
2,I forgot to clarify the distinction I was trying to make between morals and ethics. Morals deal with what is and ethics deal with the way things ought to be.
1,"I'm having a hard time not resorting to petty argument tactics such as ""you are stupid"". But let me be clear. You _ARE_ stupid. Having gotten that out of the way, let's discuss why. First, you think a boy who sees a picture of a ""normal"" family will be confused that his ""mom"" has muscles. A 2 year old is well aware of gender differences and perfectly capable of understanding that he has two dads, rather than a mom and a dad. Secondly, you believe that child will feel hurt and pain at the ""cruel truth"". What cruel truth is that exactly? That he was adopted by two loving people to be given a better life than he otherwise would have had? Finally, STD's are contractable by heterosexuals too. I ask that you stop and think prior to engaging in discussion. I have one further question for you. If homosexuality goes against nature as you say, then is it a choice people make? And if so, when did you choose to be heterosexual?"
2,"OK maybe I'm naive but I always thought that very complex things had designers. Complexity is a sign of intelligence I thought. I also thought that when you designed something you had a purpose and function in mind. For example when GM designs a car they design it to be driven on roads, not across lakes. And I thought the designer determined the purpose and function, not the thing made. Now you could attempt to drive your car across the lake because you think it's a boat. But the results will quickly tell you that it was not designed for that purpose.Now maybe I'm being very naive again but I think that human beings are very complex things, vastly more complex than we know. So it would seem to me from an engineering perspective that just to design and make a human function would require an intelligence that is beyond anything we can conceive. Just think for a minute what you would have to know about chemistry. Not to mention that you would then have to take this concept and write it in a genetic code. And if that's not incredible enough. Just think what it takes to make it beautiful.All this to say that it's plain we have a creator, someone who designed us. Someone who had a purpose and function in mind when we were designed. It is then this designer who determines our purpose and function, not us. So therefore if we have a purpose and function for which we were designed I think we should be able to tell from the results whether or not we are using our bodies for the purpose for which they were designed. For example, my cell phone has a purpose for which it was designed; To make and take calls. Now what happens when I think it will also make a great hammer? I quickly find out that it wasn't designed for that purpose.So. Is homosexuality morally wrong? Well check the results. Married men live longer, healthier, happier and productive lives. Homosexual men live half as long, have high rates of drug use, infectious disease and suicide. But don't take my word for it. Check the results yourself so you'll know I'm not just making this up.Final thought for all those who will object that it is not plain we were designed. Consider how Richard Dawkins deals with the reality of design in biology. He sees it and recognizes it but because of the implications he has to say that it ""gives the appearance of having been designed for a purpose"" The Blind Watchmaker Maybe I'm an idiot but that sure sounds like a denial of the obvious. What else does it mean when you say something gives the appearance of. You mean it sure looks that way but it's not. And why not Mr. Dawkins? because it would prove you wrong? Oh how prone we are to self deception and self justification. So much for following the evidence were ever it leads."
2,Yes it goes against nature.A million other reasons why it's morally wrong.... but as far as I know it.. it's fucked up.

1,"Oil spills occur in nature, therefore they are natural and good. School shootings occur in nature, therefore they are natural and good. Interesting morality you got here.Oh but, you say. Homosexuality doesn't hurt anyone. Really? why is their life expectancy rate almost half that of heterosexual males? It's certainly not from bigotry and intolerance. It's more like suicide and infectious disease.So in short the morality you propose is woefully inadequate. I'll stick to basing mine on the immutable character of our creator, not the changing opinions of mere men."
1,"You need to add the clause: ""as long as it does no forseeable harm to others"". Then it's a perfect answer."
1,"Furthermore, your idea that children should be left to their biological parents (while holding no water) is moot in a discussion of -adoption-.  The children, if put up for adoption, will presumably -not- be raised by their biological parents.So let's see what evidence you have.""How many of you have ever regretted NOT being raised by a same sex couple? If you were making the choice for yourself, is it what you would have chosen?""In light of the evidence I presented above, that argument is equivalent to any of the following arguments:Have you regretted not being of the opposite gender?Have you regretted not being born ten seconds after your actual birth?Have you regretted not being of a different race?Have you regretted not being born ten miles away?You get my point.  The argument you presented in that quote is moot, because (1) one can never make such a judgment unless compelling scientific evidence has arisen (which has not been provided); and because (2) aspirations of an individual don't translate to aspirations for the society.""You can say a child's peers shouldn't haze them for being part of an alternate lifestyle, and no doubt they should not. That doesn't change the fact that they do.""So you would punish the child and the child's parents for an injustice committed by -someone else-?  That's harsh."
2,"I've made a personal life choice and I think I have a genetic disposition to taking other peoples things; I'm a thief.

I bet you've got some cool stuff.Final thought, I'll bet money you don't instinctively believe your argument. You only believe it when your trying to justify your behavior that you instinctively know is wrong. But If somebody is violating you I'd bet a million dollars you get morally objective real quick and say something like; you shouldn't do that. To which I would reply; why not? And you might say; because it's wrong. And I would say; how do you know it's wrong? And you might say; I just know it is.So I don't have to prove your argument is false because you know instinctively that it is."

2,"Well if we were living in Israel under the Old Covenant I guess you might have a point. But since we aren't your point is mute. We are however living in America, at least I am, and it turns out our Founding Fathers grounded our from of government and it's laws on a Judeo-Christian ethic. Now you are correct that some have have fought very hard to ""overcome"" that by removing that foundation. Perhaps that's why our nation is on the verge of collapse. Because we have changed it's foundation to the shifting sands of the opinions of men and not on the immutable character of our creator.And yes, evil is a reality. It's something you seem to be very aware of and something the Bible never fears exposing, even in it's greatest heroes, like Moses and King David just to name a few. You also seem to be very concerned about evil's presence in the world. But what I want to know is what are you doing about the evil in your own heart? have you made peace with it or war? And finally, what hope do you offer that evil someday will be eradicated from our world? I'd love to hear what hope you offer."
1,"Homosexuality is a natural phenomenon: people are born and some are gay. Nothing has been ""tinkered with"". As proof that it's not a ""social invention"", we can observe other members of the animal kingdom who also have the incidence of homosexuality within their populations. See:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_displaying_homosexual_behavior and the links therein.It can't conceivably be condemned as ""unnatural"" when it's natural. Add to that the fact that even if it was a social construction, that alone wouldn't make it bad."
1,"Nope, if the homosexual thinks they are being morally wrong by being gay, then I guess to them it's morally wrong, to me my morals say it's not wrong. So. Morals of each person differ. I don't have a choice to change someones morals. They can do what they want"
1,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj2-_tFXXT4 People don't choose to be gay! If people are saying its wrong to be born gay, its like saying its wrong to be born a certain race. Also how is natural birth can possibliy be morally wrong?"
1,"Nope! What's wrong about homosexuality? I think that it is a personal choice.Marriage is about union of two souls, not two genders. As long as the couples love each other, no matter they are a gay or a lesbian, they do have their rights to get married, no one should have stop them. Although homosexuals can't reproduce, they could adopt those homeless children as their child.The reason why some people who think that homosexuality is morally wrong is because it is against their religion but do they ever think about others? Must others gonna be same as them. No one has the rights to force others to do things because in this 21st century, everyone do have their freedom!"
1,"Well, dolphins are sometimes gay. God apparently made everything but humans were apparently the only ones capable of sin due to that whole apple job a&e;pulled. Something like that anyways.If dolphins can have gay sex without incurring the wrath of god, I'm sure it should be no different for humans."
1,Is heterosexuality morally wrong? Seems fair enough of a question for me to ask.
1,"This argument is quite simple. Either homosexuality is a choice, or it is something you are born with. Having never made the choice to be heterosexual, I believe it is a natural phenomenon that people are born with. Perhaps it is God's way of limiting population growth. To those that believe it is a choice, did YOU ever choose to be heterosexual? If it is not a choice, then there is no point arguing the morality of it. Morality involves choices you make. It would be like saying being black is immoral. It's simply idiotic."
2,"First of all, these groups are too small to have any statistical meaning. Second, there is no indication of how these so called studies were conducted, how participants were chosen, how questions were phrased, or answers were graded, or even the least indication of anything resembling a double blind.

Give me a break!!!RE: ""So you would punish the child and the child's parents for an injustice committed by -someone else-?""Is English your second language? Your own quotes refute your position and show that children raised by same sex couples are at least as screwed up in the head, and likely more so, than children raised in broken homes. I don't know how you define ""disadvantage"", but this clearly is one, which happens to be the essence of the topic in the first place.No one is talking about ""punishing"" anyone. If you are part of a same sex couple, you are quite obviously well aware that union WILL NOT PRODUCE CHILDREN. You are evidently of the view that human children should be a free market item of commerce, as available as a puppy at a pound. Even adoption of puppies these days is subject to a certain amount of screening by the better run shelters. Do you have a fenced yard? Do you have a stable home? Are you tempermentally suited to caring for a puppy? Etc.As stated previously, a stable, opposite sex parent home, is the ideal environment to raise children. Your three post rant shows nothing to refute that claim. That the researchers you cite won't waste their time trying to compare same sex couples to that model speaks for itself. They know better, and if you are at all honest, so do you.If you're gay, accept yourself for what you are and try to live the happiest and best life you can on that basis. If you can do that, my hat's off to you. If you're insecure in what you are, and believe you can prop that up by dragging an innocent child into the mix, you are selfish, irresponsible and unworthy of respect. Anyone who thinks they should be able to buy a kid in order to feed their ego is not a good person."

1,"why are gays bad. as far as i can tell it is because either god said so or because people have an underlying fear against them. gays are not hurting anybody by being homosexual, so it doesn't make any sense."
1,"The way to look at it, in my opinion, holds that you should ask yourself the question ""In what way would allowing gay marriages make me think different about the value of my own, straight, marriage"". When you ask yourself this the answer is obvious, of course it wouldn't, as it's completely separate from your own. If, for instance, two convicted criminals would marry, you probably wouldn't attach this marriage to your own. The same counts for gay marriage, you may not agree with it but the marriage is completely separate from your own and wouldn't affect it in any way. The only argument people opposed to gay marriage could make is the religious one. But as the constitution specifically states a division between religion and state this argument is moot."
1,"In the Loving v. Virginia case before the US Supreme Court (which struck bans on interracial marriage), the decision states, ""Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to our very existence and survival.... The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State."" Marriage is a legal contract formed and recognized by the state, and the people have the right to choose their partner in this contract. Nothing could be simpler."

The only practical, fair solution is to allow same-sex marriage."
2,"Replace the word ""marriage"" in government documents with the word ""civil union"", ta da! The government then only deals with civil unions between two consenting adults of any gender. Marriage would then be a word reserved for individuals and churches to define. If a church decides that only a man and a woman can marry then same sex couples will not be recognized as being married by that church or members of that church. They would still receive the same benefits of a civil union (previously known by the government as a ""marriage"") but the ""sanctity of marriage"" is maintained for groups who do not approve of same sex couples. Marriage is a word whose connotation and definition differ from individual to individual. The use of the word by government is provocation for misunderstanding and schism. Will people immediately say ""Wow, the government isn't calling your union a marriage so I'm OK with you now,""? No. But that's too bad. A hundred and fifty years ago people looked at a freedman walking down the street and said ""Somebody aught to sell him."" Society has to change and we as rational human beings have to acknowledge that even when we don't approve of someone's choices they have a right to make them. We have to accept that all humans are entitled to equal treatment under the law. No one should be treated differently by the law because of their social class, their gender, their sexual preferences, their race, or any other traits unless they have in some way harmed another person through direct action or inaction."
1,"Yes, I understand what you're saying and I agree that ideally that would be the best thing to do. But I'm saying it's not practical to do that because people would go apeshit if we replaced the word ""marriage"" with ""civil union"" everywhere. They'd say we were ""undermining the Christian foundations of our nation."" They'd say we were ""demeaning a fundamental pillar of society."" They'd say it was ""political correctness run amok."" It would never get done. Legalizing gay marriage is the easier way to achieve equality."
2,"The easy thing is hardly ever the right thing. That's one of the biggest problems with the world in any place at any time, people look for whatever will patch the problem as easily and as quickly as possible. Doing the hard thing requires the willingness to stand up and say we do these things ""...not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."" And while John F. Kennedy was talking about going to the Moon that's the mentality that we as responsible members of any society must have towards everything we do. It doesn't matter what action is taken, you can't please everyone so we must do what is right regardless of the criticism and uproar that comes of it. The right thing, the hard thing, is only rarely supported by the masses of the present but is always appreciated by the public of the future. P.S. Sorry this came out of the blue, this debate came back into my attention and I felt that I should finish what I meant to say but never had the time or the energy when I first got involved."
2,"I do feel sorry for anyone who can't marry the person of who they want to spend the rest of their life with. However, those who choose to go with their desires and follow the gay path with all it's goods also have to accept it's bads. Marriage is accepted as a bond between Man and WIFE. With it comes legal and moral rights and obligations. And some of us do actually still respect them. There are alot of people who aren't able, for one reason or another to marry the partner of their choice, who aren't gay. Do you think a brother and sister should be able to get married if they fall in love. Certain religions will only allow men from their religion to marry women from their religion.And a man who respects that religion will abide by that rule Some nationalities wont allow interracial marriages.. Certain States apparently do recognise gay marriages so if you want to get married as a gay couple and have it recognised than move to that state. But i don't think it should be accepted across the board, which will probably piss off alot of the gays that I know."
1,"However, those who choose to go with their desires and follow the gay path with all it's goods also have to accept it's bads. Simple question: Did you ever choose to follow the heterosexual path? Furthermore, what are the ""goods"" associated with the gay path, compared to the heterosexual one? From what I can see it's a much harder path to go down. I can't really fathom why someone might CHOOSE to go that way, unless of course they were BORN gay, in which case you're discriminating against a condition people have no control over."
1,"Gershon et al. and the main one, Wainright et al. (though the Gershon one ... the way it was cited in the study confuses me, and may also be, as you said, a ""broken"" home, and the Wainright one -does- have forty-four participants)."
2,"As for did I ever CHOOSE to go the heterosexual path , the answer is YES I DID.As for what are the perks. Many gay people would claim that their coming out has brought them great relief and as much, if not more, possitive attention than when they were choosing to portray themselves as heterosexual. Also many gays who choose a partner of their own sex claim that there are alot of advantages, such as the feelings of love are deeper and feel more real, their desire for sex with that person rather than with someone of the opposite sex is stronger and the sex more satisfying, and I could keep going on and on. Also in certain fields of work, such as fashion design or interior design, the gay guy is usually assumed as going to be good before even showing any other credentials. And how can someone really say they are BORN gay, when boys and girls don't really even know the difference between the sexes until they are at least 2-3."
1,"1. ""As for did I ever CHOOSE to go the heterosexual path , the answer is YES I DID."" Really? What age were you when you chose to be heterosexual? Is it something you struggle with daily? Do you have to remind yourself that heterosexual is the choice you've made and you're sticking with it? What motivated you to go heterosexual when there are clearly so many damn perks to being gay? 2. ""Many gay people would claim that their coming out has brought them great relief"" Duh duh duh. Of course coming out brings them relief. This has nothing to do with a perk of being gay. This is a perk of being who they are and being unashamed of it. 3. ""many gays who choose a partner of their own sex claim that there are alot of advantages, such as the feelings of love are deeper and feel more real, their desire for sex with that person rather than with someone of the opposite sex is stronger and the sex more satisfying"" Go figure. Gay people prefer same sex relationships. That's your argument here. In the same way, I'm sure you would claim the feelings of love are deeper and feel more real with someone of the opposite sex, and that your desire for sex with them is stronger and more satisfying. You've just defined what being gay is, not given a perk. 4. ""Also in certain fields of work, such as fashion design or interior design, the gay guy is usually assumed as going to be good before even showing any other credentials."" Really? Usually? Not to be a bitch, but prove it. My grandfather owned a flower shop for 20 years, and while gay men worked for him and were damn good floral designers, he NEVER hired on the basis of their sexuality. They were hired BECAUSE they were good. 5. ""And how can someone really say they are BORN gay, when boys and girls don't really even know the difference between the sexes until they are at least 2-3""Sexual identity develops at around 12, while sexual interest develops around the age of 7.

2,"yeah what if someone wants to marry an animal,or if someone thats mother/son or father/daughter etc. wouldn't that be discriminating against a group because you don't agree with there views just like gay marriage..i mean that's what the gay marriage supporters argue that they should have the same rights as straight couples shouldn't a couple be able to marry even if it's mother/son or father daughter and yeah most people are against such things but its none of our business just like gay marriage and if the gay community says this is wrong isn't that being a little hypocritical?"

Incest IS wrong......For mother/daughter/son/father/uncle/aunt/cousin  etc would mean that the rights of parenting are being abused. misleading the innocence of a child.tends to produce medical hicks..........next.... RAPE......of animals IS wrong.....they have no ability of consent.....(tho lightheartingly some people like marrying their pets just as they may leave them their estates when they die,you know the non-beastiality, animal lovers types)"
2,"1. Civil unions is the same as being married. It just has a different name.2. A gay couple can say that they're married without any problem.3. What you're really asking is ""Should gays have the right to force everyone else call their civil union a marriage?"""
1,"1. No first of all it's not. Civil unions do not grant all the rights of marriage. Only 9 states offer civil unions to same-sex couples with almost all the rights of marriages. Six other states offer civil unions to same-sex couples with some of the rights. Therefore no civil union has the same rights as marriages, and most states don't even have civil unions. Also the federal government does not recognize civil unions and due to the Defense of Marriage Act, same-sex couples in marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships do not have ""1,138 rights, benefits and privileges that a married couple has under federal law.""So thank you for the talking point from NOM, but you're totally incorrect. Civil unions are not the same as being married. But even if they were, this would not be acceptable. How can you possibly think it is fair to deem one type of union unworthy of being called marriage. Would this have been an acceptable alternative when interracial marriage was illegal? Oh it's okay you can't get married to someone of a different race because you can just get a civil union?2. This is a really dumb statement. Yeah sure and 100 years ago women could say they can vote without any problem. Except that it's not true.I really don't understand why people even care enough to be opposed to gay marriage. It doesn't hurt anybody, what is the big deal?"
2,"Well, lets think about this... Which is easier:1. To force the federal government to give civil unions the same exact right as marriages or2. To force their version of marriage down the rest of our throats?"
2,"Easier != what is rightAlso that's a pretty crappy way to describe it as forcing equality down everyone's throats.Slavery being illegal was forced down everyone's throats, women's suffrage was forced down everyone's throats, but that doesn't make it bad."
2,"I have found that there are a few argument tactics that are used to get people to agree with the point being defended. One of those tactics is to associate the opposing point to something that is almost universally despised. This tactics works because a lot of people are passionate beings that are too lazy to analyze the argument and realize that there was an association made (not an comparison).For example, associating civil unions with slavery and no suffrage for women is not a comparison.Civil unions are the same thing as marriage, only with a different name (this is a comparison). Slavery was not the same thing as freedom, only with a different name. Women not allowed to vote was not the same as women suffrage, only with a different name. Therefore one cannot make the comparison between civil unions and slavery (or civil unions and suffrage) and show that they are similar. In both slavery and not allowing women to vote, people were losing rights. In civil unions, they are given marriage rights (but a different word is used)."
1,"Actually the word you are looking for is called analogy. I know it's kind of a difficulty concept so I will explain it. Making an analogy is comparing similarities between to ideas. So if I make an analogy between gay marriage and interracial marriage, I am talking about things that are similar between them. No one in their right mind would take this to mean I am asserting they are the same thing.And I know segregation was awhile ago, so you may have forgotten, but the supreme court ruled that separate is not equal. You can't have one one type of thing for one group and one for another. WARNING: Incoming analogy. White water fountains and black water fountains. Straight marriages and gay civil unions."
2,"RE: ""the Wainright one -does- have forty-four participants""These so called ""studies"", as described, amount to polls. Split into two groups, your margin of error is on the order of plus or minus 25% for each group. In other words, comparing the two groups would involve potential errors of close to 50%. It's not a study that can be taken seriously, or cited with any credibility.A serious study would involve several thousand participants, which would give you a margin of error in the 3% range, with a level of confidence around 95%. I'd also argue that you'd want your participants to be more in the 25 to 40 age range, rather than teenagers. At that age, they'd have more perspective, be less succeptable to slanted surveys, and have more life experience to draw from.Of course, propagandists don't do serious studies."
1,"WARNING: Incoming analogy. White water fountains and black water fountains. Straight marriages and gay civil unions.You're right. The analogy doesn't work because you could have dirty run down water fountains reserved strictly for one group and the nice clean ones for another group. However, if the states drop the use of the word ""marriage"" and replace it with he words ""civil union"" then there wouldn't be a ""separate but equal"" situation and only churches and religious organizations will be left using the word marriage and (I know this is difficult for you to grasp but) since we have separation of church and state, the supreme court doesn't have a say in what word churches use. Have a nice day, lead head ;)"
1,"WARNING: Incoming facts.""The analogy doesn't work because you could have dirty run down water fountains reserved strictly for one group and the nice clean ones for another group.""Here you claim that segregation is unconstitutional because facilities were of a lesser quality for blacks. Your implication is that were facilities absolutely equal in all respects, this would be legal. Therefore you say that since marriage and civil unions afford the same rights (which they don't even come close to doing which I have told you before, but which is irrelevant to the point) that this is also legal. Unfortunately for you your US history seems to be a bit rusty. The doctrine of separate but equal, was established in the Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson. The Supreme Court ruled that segregation was constitutional. Now in 1954 the Supreme Court made a new decision on segregation in the case Brown v. Board of Education. The constitutional basis of the case was the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. The Supreme Court decided that the quality of the black and white schools does not change the fact that separate is inherently not equal. A few quotes from the decision:""Segregation of white and Negro children in the public schools of a State solely on the basis of race, pursuant to state laws permitting or requiring such segregation, denies to Negro children the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment -- even though the physical facilities and other ""tangible"" factors of white and Negro schools may be equal.""""Here, unlike Sweatt v. Painter, there are findings below that the Negro and white schools involved have been equalized, or are being equalized, with respect to buildings, curricula, qualifications and salaries of teachers, and other ""tangible"" factors.""""To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.""So as you can see segregation would be unconstitutional regardless of the relative qualities of the things being segregated. Therefore my analogy works perfectly. Even if civil unions and marriages granted the exact same rights, which they don't, making gays get a different form of marriage ""generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone."" Consequently it is unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for homosexual unions to be given a different moniker.And if I had my druthers I would prefer states only issue civil unions to all couples and no marriage licenses because marriage has religious connotations. But barring that gays must be allowed to get married as well.""(I know this is difficult for you to grasp but) since we have separation of church and state, the supreme court doesn't have a say in what word churches use.""I never made this assertion or an assertion with this as a logical conclusion. Enjoy your red herring. It tastes too fishy for me."
1,"OK, so we agree on the following:And if I had my druthers I would prefer states only issue civil unions to all couples and no marriage licenses because marriage has religious connotations.Now the question is, does the state have the power to force the church to marry gays? I say no. But that's OK because the state also does not have the power to prevent gays from starting a religion that will marry them."
1,"No obviously I don't think the state has the right to force churches to marry gays. If they want to be intolerant that is their business. However in a similar vein I do think all religions should lose their tax exempt status. Because I think it violates the Lemon Test decided in Lemon v. Kurtzman for testing the violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment. It forces the government to decide which religions are legitimate and this ""needlessly entangles the government in religion."" Furthermore all of the money that is lost in exempt taxes from churches does not benefit the entire country, only members of that religion. Yes money that goes to charity benefits everyone, but then only that money should be deducted from their taxes and they should pay tax on the rest. This also fails the Lemon Test because again it forces the government to decide which religions are legitimate and worthy of tax exemption.So for you is the second best option allowing gays to be married or do you jump straight from only civil unions for all to no gay marriages?"
1,I say:1. all religions should lose their tax exempt status.2. only civil unions for all.3. churches decide to marry gays or not.
1,"Okay I'm glad we are in agreement on those, but you didn't answer my last question.Is your order of preference:A) Civil unions for allB) Marriages for allC) Marriages for heterosexual unions, civil unions for homosexual unionsorA) Civil unions for allB) Marriages for heterosexual unions, civil unions for homosexual unionsC) Marriages for all ?"
1,"I'm mostly against marriages for all so the last one... although I'm being forced to chose from a set I wouldn't normally chose from.

1,Civil unions is the same as being married. It just has a different name.So...separate but equal? I'm thinking we tried that once before and it didn't work out.

1,"Once upon a time, there were these people. And they came in many colors (Really, only about four or five). Anyway, some of these people thought that they should have separate facilities than those of darker colors. Separate schools, separate bathrooms, separate seats on the bus (Talk about a waste of taxpayer money!). The light colored people thought it was great, but the dark colored people did not. They realized that they got what is known worldwide today as The Shaft. Separate but equal is never equal. You either give equal rights or you don't. ---------------------------------I support civil unions for all marriages that occur outside the church, but let rights be entirely equal for all."
2,"Gay marriage should be compared against average marriages; not worst case ones. All of the arguments negating this question are compared against the dysfunctions occurring in worst case heterosexual marriages.

I agree that a person doesn't Choose who they fall in love with, but they do choose to act on it. There are alot of gay people out there who have chosen to be in heterosexual relationships for reasons of their own, just as someone else has chosen to go with their desires and follow the path they feel is right for them.

Ask a lot of the happy thousands of kids and adults raised by homosexual couples if theyd prefer to have been raised by heterosexual couples and the answer will be different from your assumption.Your parents having divorced when you wree so little is regrettable, but what you really wished for at that age is the idea of a happy loving couple to raise you as you have no idea what the reality of that union would have been. You could have been raised by a bickering always-at-each-other's-throats couple and you would have begged your parents to divorce under those circumstances.  People who give you life in the first place are not guaranteed to build a happy home and living with them in an unhappy home is a huge disadvantage and anythiong else becomes an advantage.a heterosexual loving couple is nomore of an ideal than a homosexual loving couple, this is purely a matter of different strokes for different folks, lets open our minds and thinking a bit here.Some kids and folks are nasty, it does not mean we should ban interracial, huge age gap and homosexual marriages and families as long as both parties involved in the home building and   parenting   are adult and of sound mental   health  .U say ""It is irrefutable that it is only possible to produce   children   through heterosexual means.

I can't even begin to express how low my opinion is of anyone who would use children as bargaining chips as a way to legitimize their own lifestyle choices.

And I don't think i need to worry about having to turn gay because like YOU said ''it would only take less than 10% of mankind , it wouldn't be a big deal '' Good job backing up your argument!! That will never happen,at least in my lifetime or yours! Nobody is forcing people to be straight, that is an opinion that is strongly enforced!!! LOOK IT UP!!! GOSH,I HATE gay fags,all gay fags can go to hell where they belong!!!"
1,Hahahaha. RRRRAAAAAAAAAGGGGGEEEE!!!!Have you ever thought you might be gay?
1,"ON YA JESSALD...HA HA HA LOVE IT....HERE IS MY THOUGHT ON THE MATTER...........BTW..Then why cant we just say gay marriage then.You blasphermous reli-goons piss me off -why dont you all get a life instead of trying to control every body elses right to live how they choose. If it doesnt involve corrupting the innocence of children who are you to condemn two peoples right to marriage,regardless of thier sexual preference.No amount of mds'/scientists oppinion based on their own research can establish those claims in regards to deseases,premature death etc Again i think we need to hear from some honest good christian folk who work LEGALLY in the sex industries and know who and what goes on behind closed doors,maybe they can enlighten everyones oppinions in this debate,or at least in effort to educate those that live their life through the words or beliefs of their religious bias rather than just living..might i add that all of these reli-goons forget, ""that to preach the words of the lord in defence of your own beliefs is blasphemy in itself."""
1,Who says it's immoral? ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
2,Christians and Jews say that it's immoral. LEVICTICUS 18:22
2,"Levicticus 18:22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind; it is abomination."
1,How about we list a couple other things the Bible bans:-Leviticus 19:27 - Shaving-Ephesians 5:4 - Cursing-Leviticus 19:16 - Gossip-Leviticus 11:10 - Eating Lobster-Leviticus 11:17 - Eating Pork-Leviticus 19:19 - Cotton/Polyester Blends-Leviticus 15:19-20 - Associating with women who on their periods So now tell me why these shouldn't also be illegal?By making laws based on Bible quotes you are forcing your religion on others.By picking and choosing which Bible quotes to enforce you are being hypociritical.

1,"“I do not mean to be unkind, but   homosexuality   is not a survival characteristic, it's an evolutionary dead end.”Actually there is evidence to the contrary.  Male penguins raising a chick together are a good example of how homosexual parings can promote the survival of the species.   This lends credence to the idea that homosexuals help with population survival buy providing additional caretakers for the young while not contributing young of their own.“You can argue that other alternatives to the traditional family unit are equally contra survival, perhaps even with some small merit, but that doesn't   change   the fact that the traditional family unit provides the best possible   benefits   to   children  .”That argument has been made before… and as before I have to ask what evidence you base that assumption on?Furthermore children adopted by homosexuals are already without a ‘traditional family unit’, and so all that really needs to be shown is that being raised by a homosexual couple is better then being left in foster care.“The big difference between a pet kitten and a human child is with the kitten, you are not responsible for teaching it everything it will need to know to survive for the 50 plus years it will live after leaving your care.”So couples need to be careful when considering having children?  No part of this entire rant applies exclusively to homosexuals (which is to say it is a statement that could be made to any couple regardless of the couples gender).“The moment you say you should be allowed to impose your will on another, you will fnd me in adament opposition to your position.”How is this imposing anyone’s will on you?“Do what you like as long as you do me no harm in the process, and leave children alone.”So children should not be placed in potentially loving homes?"
2,"I'm not forcing MY religion on anyone; I'm just stressing the teachings of Judaism and Christianity. And the last time I checked, Christians and Jews are still the largest group of people in the United States. (For those who couldn't tell, I was asking whether gay marriage should be legal in the U.S.)"
1,"The U.S. was not founded on religion... in fact the first Amendment states ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion."" Whether you want to follow the teachings of a religion in your private life is one thing, but when you deny others rights based on the teachings of your religion you are limiting the rights of others.What if a law was passed that made it illegal to eat meat of fridays? It shouldn't matter if a religious group is the majority, they still shouldn't be allowed to force their beliefs on others. The majority of the people in this nation are also white, but does that give white people the right to take away the rights of minority groups? Of course not.The reason our nation is not a full democracy is to ensure that the majority are not allowed to take advantage of the minority. We have checks and balances to stop the tyranny of the majority.Why though do you consider homosexuality wrong, and not the other things I mentioned? Do you ever eat shellfish or pork? Do you shave? Have you ever touched a woman while she was on her period?To make laws on religion is foolish. Our nation is not a theocracy. Do what you want in your personal life but don't force me to follow to your rules."
2,"Firstly, I think eating meat on Fridays should be illegal. Secondly, many of the things you listed that the bible bans are made acceptable in the New Testament. I do eat pork and shellfish. I do shave. I do wear cotton/polyester blends. The bible does allow me to do those things. But the New Testament does not make homosexuality acceptable. It is still, under all circumstances, immoral and wrong."
1,"Firstly, I think eating meat on Fridays should be illegal.Answer me this: Why should my freedoms be limited because of your beliefs? Should I also be required to go to church every Sunday? Does me eating meat hurt anyone? What gives you the right to tell me what I can and can't do, if my actions have no effect on you?Let me repeat: Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion. That is literally how the bill of rights starts.In addition, you clearly aren't a very good Christian if you think your not allowed to eat meat on Fridays. The Catholic Church lifted that ban years ago. It's only on lent that you aren't allowed to eat meat on Fridays. You might want to get your facts straight (otherwise you may end being torchered for all of eternity, because God loves you).Finally, our constitution was founded on enlightenment principles of rationality and reason. Merely saying something is wrong ""because the bible says so"" puts us back in the dark ages. Something can be wrong because it hurts people, or has a negative effect on society. Both eating meat, and homosexuality do not fall into either category, and therefore cannot be immoral.Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion"
2,"a) Roman Catholics still don't eat meat on Fridays, with the exception of fish.b) You say homosexuality should be acceptable because it has no negative impact on society. But it does negatively impact society by going against nature and by going against almost every organized religion on the planet: not just Christianity and Judaism, but also Hinduism, Mormonism, Islam, and countless others. By advocating acceptance for homosexuality, you are opposing the beliefs of a majority of the world's population.c) Take that, heathen! lol"
1,"What do you mean, take that, heathen!? You used that in completely incorrect context. This irks me greatly."
1,"Roman Catholics still don't eat meat on Fridays, with the exception of fish1) Actually, my entire family is Roman Catholic, a decent portion of my friends are Roman Catholic, and I have heard the priest at my Church explain multiple times the rules regarding eating meat on fridays (I guess I forgot to mention that I go to a Roman Catholic Church every Sunday). The rules are: it's okay to eat meat on fridays (except lent) however, if you do choose to eat meat you should give something else up.So in short: you're wrong.2) First: It doesn't go against nature because it can be found prevalently in nature.

I could go on about birds, fish, reptiles and all sorts of different other kinds of animals, but I think you get my point. If God did create the world, then clearly he is a fan of homosexuality.Next: Just because a large group of people think something, doesn't make it right. Are you a puppet? Can you not think for yourself? If everyone thought that snowflakes were god's dandruff would that make it right? In fact a large majority of the earth's population thought that the earth was flat, and the majority of the U.S. thought slavery was alright and used Bible verses to support their position.If all your going to argue is: well most of these religions think this so it must be right, then I don't see the point in continuing. Your argument isn't valid. You also never tell me how, specifically it hurts society. They're not forcing those people who think it's immoral to be homosexual, or even to condone homosexuality. Homosexuals are merely looking for their own rights.3) Thanks for providing proof that you are using multiple accounts."
2,"I think you might find that most if not all of these animals would be considered to have bisexual tendancies, not homosexual tendencies, as I am sure they are still drawn to mate with the opposite sex or are they all extinct."
1,"I think you misunderstood the list. It is a list of animals in which portions of the population exhibit homosexual behavior. The percentages vary widely, and usually there are sections of the population that are also bisexual, in addition to those sections who appear to be exclusively homosexual.In all of these populations, there are obviously significant sections (usually the majority) of the population which are heterosexual, because, as you said, they couldn't survive as a species otherwise."
1,I stand corrected. Well clarified...blah blah blah filler
2,"RE: ""So   children   should not be placed in potentially loving homes?""Children should be in homes where they have some chance to grow up normal. If you want a gay penguin for a pet, go for it.

Our pledge of allegiance changes from 'Under God' to 'Under Gods' or 'Under the Sky'. Our ten commandments (which most Christians including myself don't really adhere to that well) are dashed against rocks and in their place are statues of Vishnu and Krishna. Instead of praying before congressional meetings we all get together and meditate on the higher sense of self.Take your religion out of my government. Also, if gays can't marry then they shouldn't pay as much in taxes. Our taxes go to pay for TONS of services homosexuals can't benefit from. Marriage bureaus and Adoption Services are two obvious examples.And don't even get me started on gays in the military when they have to register for the draft."

1,"Thomas Jefferson does not mention in the Declaration of Independence the name of the Creator from whom we gain our rights.Knowing Jefferson, it can't be a Judeo-Christian creator (God, Yahweh, Jehovah, etc.), but was a deistic creator, so the appeal to scripture-based morality falls flat with regard to this misplaced reference of the Declaration of Independence."

1,"I believe my point rests unchallenged. It is clear from the letters of Jefferson, especially to his esteemed Deist comrades, that Jefferson's God was not the God of the Bible.

Until then, you have not confirmed Biblical authority over morality or the law of the United States, nor contributed anything I would call a refutation of my claim."

All evidence shows that homosexual couples are as caring and supportive as heterosexual couples.""Two wrongs don't make a right.""Quite true... a child denied the family that that were born into is further wronged by being denied a loving home just because the couple is homosexual."

1,"Very well, so I did... :)(...filling up character space...)"
1,"In Thomas Jefferson's letters and papers (my copy: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/094045016X/), ,) he labeled himself a ""Materialist"" (letter to William Short, April 13, 1820), rejected the Christian doctrine of the ""Trinity"" (letter to Justin Pierre, Count de Rieux, Jul. 25, 1788), as well as the doctrine of an eternal Hell (letter to F. A. Van der Kemp, May 1, 1817). Further, Jefferson specifically named Joseph Priestly (English Unitarian) and Conyers Middleton (English Deist) and said: ""I rest on them ... as the basis of my own faith"" (letter to John Adams, Aug. 22, 1813). Therefore, not only did Jefferson deny the central tenants of Christianity, he also issued an authentic statement claiming Deism as his faith. As I said, unknowingly, but not unexpectedly, in concert with Encyclopedia Britannica, ""The second and third presidents of the United States also held Deistic convictions, as is amply evidenced in their correspondence.""http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/156154/Deism/38254/Deists-in-other-countries Jefferson studied the philosophy of John Locke and the ""natural theology,"" which was the subject of Thomas Paine's ""The Age of Reason,"" and agreed with Paine's convictions that it was a grave injustice to lock God into a sacred text. Paine immeasurably influenced Jefferson's interpretation of the Bible, as evidenced by the so-called ""Jefferson Bible,"" which deliberately excludes the claims of Christ's divinity (...and to deny the divinity of Christ is to not be a Christian). For Thomas Paine, the only revelation from God is one that is perceived in creation. Only through creation does ""God speaketh universally to man."" To not understand Thomas Jefferson's philosophical relationship with his Deistic colleagues and with the Church is not to understand Thomas Jefferson.I think I have sourced TJ's Deism enough at least for my own satisfaction, if not for yours, but I will add that the following words appear in Volume 3 of Dumas Malone's rightfully celebrated biography, ""Jefferson and His Time,"" with regard to the accusation that Jefferson was an atheist: ""...it was not only made in the public press, it was hurled from pulpits in various places, most of all probably in Connecticut. ... Actually, he was a deist (481).""This whole problem about identifying the Creator mentioned in the Declaration of Independence reminds me of a similar problem Jefferson encountered with regard to the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom. He wrote in his autobiography, ""Where the preamble declares, that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, an amendment was proposed by inserting ""Jesus Christ,"" so that it would read 'A departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion;' the insertion was rejected by the great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantle of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mohammedan, the Hindoo and Infidel of every denomination.""This is the very same vision of the Creator mentioned in the DoI; a creator that is accessible to people of all faiths because his name isn't Jesus Christ.All of this said, I don't know if I want to carry on defending gay marriage in this debate. I did want to defend the historical integrity of Thomas Jefferson and I do not feel you can properly claim that I haven't."
2,"That is all very nice; thank you for supporting your Deism argument. But Jefferson's exact religious beliefs are not relevant here.The First Constitutional Amendment did not retract religion from the Declaration of Independence. Neither is it separating the United States from religion. That is why it says:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
1,"I agree with essentially all of that, but I feel that some nitpicking is in order.""The First Constitutional Amendment did not retract religion from the Declaration of Independence.""No, it does not, but as we have been discussing, the DoI does not contain the kindling of any specific religion. The First Amendment does clearly forbid the endorsement of a particular religion by the State. As long as the State is not forming legislation with preference to the Bible, the Qu'ran, the Bhagavad Gita, or any other holy text, everyone can play nice. If the State endorses scripture-dependent legislation, it clearly violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.I think all of our disagreements are pretty much hammered out now, wouldn't you say?"
2,"Wrong.You are changing your tune.Choose one: Jefferson's rejection of Trinity or all religions are cool. The Declaration of Independence can't go both ways.No; the First Amendment refers to Congress, not the state."
1,...Congress is the primary legislative organ of the State.
2,"The First Amendment to the Constitution restricts only Congress, but does not separate religion from the United States in general. The U.S.A. will continue to follow the religious message in the Declaration of Independence."

1,"If were going to say having same sex perents is a disadvantage you might as well bubble rap your self in plastic and never leave the house.If you present the agrument that   children   will get teased by having same-sex parents your right, the simple and blind view of socierty is to not except anything that is too different. But as children we have to learn how socierty functions, whats the different young or later on when they dont follow the conformity of high school life. Yes the child of a family with homosexual parents may get teased but dont we all. Children have been taught buy there parent to reject to anything they dont understand. The children that do the teasing have been raised in familys no better then a same-sex family because they are already at a young age taught to disriminate.Children from homosexual familys arn't disadvantaged, they have the amzing choice to think freely about the world. They have the habit to think about thinks before they judge. "
1,"Your argument has no foundation. It is like asking whether women in Afghanistan should be stoned if they cheat on their husbands and then quote the Quran. Do you believe in separation of church and state? Policy issues that affect a population that is allowed to freely choose their own religion (unless you state that there is no freedom of religion in the U.S.) should not be addressed through religion. Gays should be allowed to form unions that are legitimate under the law. Whether it be called ""marriage"" from a Christian point of view is irrelevant. The legality of a union does not depend on the church but on state laws."
2,Your makeup has no foundation.Consider yourself disputed.
1,"If you are going to keep one of the 614, laws you have to keep them all. I hope you are ready to kill witches and adulterers, too. Oh, and don't dare shave!"
2,"Firstly, see Exodus 20:13.Secondly, the New Testament makes shaving acceptable, but fails to mention at all that homosexuality ISN'T immoral or wrong."
2,the gays have no use in society. think about a nut and bolt you put two bolts together and it won't work. take put two nuts together and you still have nothing. but if you put a nut and bolt together you will get results needed. it works with males and females. being gay needs to be outlawed.
2,"The place was not specified, so I choose my state of Virginia. My state just amended it's constitution about three or four years ago explicitly stating that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. Therefore, gays do not have the right to marry. End of story."
2,NO. The Bible clearly states that marriage is a sacred union between male and female.
2,"Marriaige is completely a religious thing. And religion does not allow homosexuality. Fine you can have sex with anything and anyone you want but when you shun and defy religion and religious people who support and you go against all that religion says, then you try to come back and try to do things completely not allowed and change religion, that is just hypocricy. You want people to listen or so called be opened minded and listen to what you desire, then you should listen to what they desire and thats GO STRAIGHT."
1,"Marriaige is completely a religious thing.While many of us would prefer that this were the case, our current situation attaches civil benefits to marriage. As such, it is not ""completely a religious thing."" And religion does not allow homosexuality.That depends on the religion."
2,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is against what God wants.
1,"There are currently about half a million   children   in America's foster care system. Why deny any of these   kids   the love they'll receive from someone who wants to raise them? Love they may never have gotten had their biological parents kept them.Other than the fact that they share the same reproductive organs, a gay couple is no different than a heterosexual couple."
2,"I don't like the word gay being associated with homosexuals, I think pervert is more descriptive. Most people view marriage as the unity between two people of the opposite sex. Perverts who perform perverted acts on each other are trying to hijack the word marriage and apply it to their perversions. Perverts are so quick to point out that they are homosexuals, I don't see people on TV running around yelling 'I'm hetero'. Years ago the perverts were out in the streets protesting that the Federal gov. wasn't spending enough money on AIDS research. Excuse me? It's like Reagan said: AIDS is almost a fully presentable disease - don't share needles, and wear a condom if you are going to insert your penis into another human being's rectum. But, but, the perverts don't like the way it feels if they have to wear a condom, and they want your tax dollars to be used to find a cure, so they can just go out to homosexuals bars, pop a pill, and then go insert their penis into a rectum. AIDS is rampant in parts of Africa - up to 70% of the population of some countries have the virus - because the men refuse to wear condoms. Why? Because it doesn't feel good, so the vast majority of people, married, single, man and woman end up with the AIDS virus. Some perverts think they can trick people into making people believe they are hetero by getting married to a woman, and at the same time they are engaging in risky behavior performing perverted acts on other perverts. So now there is a risk of a woman contracting AIDS because she is unwittingly involved with a lying pervert."
2,All of the people calling certain others hypocrites have obviously never heard of the old or new covenants within which certain things from the old are made obsolete gay marriage is not one of them.
1,"People are blind to the real point. Gay marriage is NOT a matter for the state. Marriage is an institution created by God maintained by the church. The state has no right to dictate the actions of the church. This is a violation of the constitution the state is overstepping its bounds and its encroaching upon the rights of the church. This is an effort to take away the churches power and moral effectiveness. The constitution recognizes the churches role in a free society and the church itself is a needed structure in society, The framers of the constitution recognize and respects the soverignty of God HIS laws and the churches authority to declare them and enforce them. So gay marrige is wrong on a constitutional level and on a moral level so throuroughly it violates the laws of God and nature and lastly it violates the constitution."
2,"I'm not against the gay community in general, but there is a problem with the word ""marry"". By definition it implies a union between a man and a woman. a gay marriage is an oxymoron."
2,"I am of a neutral opinion on weather or not gay love should be accepted. Personally I think it's disgusting, that's just me. But I should point out that the term ""gay marriage"" is self contridictory. The dictionary defines marriage as: ""the social institution under which a MAN and WOMAN establish their decision to live as HUSBAND and WIFE by legal commitments, religious ceremonies, etc."". so what if someone wanted to marry their pet? Should we allow that too? People are really starting to lose the understanding of what marriage really means."
1,"The dictionary defines marriage as: ""the social institution under which a MAN and WOMAN establish their decision to live as HUSBAND and WIFE by legal commitments, religious ceremonies, etc.Some dictionaries, maybe.Merriam-Webster gives us a similar definition, but also ""(2) : the state of being united to a person of the same sex in a relationship like that of a traditional marriage.""Regardless, words change, and dictionaries are descriptive rather than prescriptive: a given dictionary serves only to reflect the usage of words at the time of its printing.so what if someone wanted to marry their pet? Should we allow that too?No, at the very least on the grounds that an animal is incapable of consenting to marriage.People are really starting to lose the understanding of what marriage really means.On this, at least, we agree. Marriage is, in origin, a religious practice, and it should remain so without any legal connotations.My personal preference remains that the state should remove itself completely from the issue of marriage and all legal unions should be ""civil unions"". Then, every church may decide the capacity of its marriages, but the state would be free to place secular restrictions on civil unions. Thus, polygamist-religions can have their multiple-marriages, conservative christian groups can forbid gay-marriage, liberal-christian groups can allow gay marriage, and the legal benefits in all cases remain the same: none. Then, any two people who want the current legal benefits associated with marriage can file for a civil union in much the same way that they are currently required to file for a ""marriage license""."
2,"AMEN!!!!!!! HEY ALL YOU GAY LOVERS ,THIS GUY AND I KNOW WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT!!!"
2,ABSOULUTELY NOT!!!!! Why do men even want to marry each other? there's no good reason about WHY they want to marry each other. Here are my points:1. Neither of them can have children.2. What would they do together at home?3. Why do they like each other?4. Wouldn't other people think it's disgusting and gross?THIS IS WHY GAY PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,You are far too young for me to even explain to you why i disagree...........................
1,"I think the question of whether they should have a legal right to marry is a no-brainer. Say what you will about your moral and / or religious objections, those are not reasons to be considered as a matter of policy."
2,"""a gay couple is not different than a heterosexual couple""???????As I see it the only difference is that the gay person has shunned and is unable to interact with the only other existing species of human on the earth.  No different?????????l"
1,"We've had this argument over and over again with the same weigh-ins as all the rest. I say yes, they should have the right to marry if they so choose. It hurts no one and helps many...children included. Children don't end up gay because their parents are no more than children grow up straight because their parents are straight. Let it go and go get married!"
1,Man this debate is active again? Jeez come on guys. Gays should have the right to do as any hetero couple. If it's been proven that people dont have a choice at birth are we gonna go back to the mindset of the 40s ? Black people cant help being black gay people cant help being gay. I'm 17 and most of the people debating on this debate have far more years of experiance in the world but cannot seem to see past this? Grow up.
1,"Yes, gay people should be allowed to make themselves every bit as miserable as straight people. Why should they get to avoid the endless bickering and squabbling that accompanies ""marital bliss""?;)"
1,that was really quite cute Banshee..........................................................................  :)
1,"Yes. While don't agree morally or naturally with homosexuality, I don't see it as very American to restrict who someone can marry. Seems a bit petty."
1,"Just out of curiosity what do you mean you don't agree morally or naturally with homosexuality? Do you mean you aren't homosexual, I don't understand?"
1,"I mean that I don't agree that homosexuality is a natural thing. I believe it is the result of complex emotional and psychological patterns, similar to those that make people hypersexual. And, yes, I am heterosexual."
1,What do you mean it isn't a natural thing? Are you saying that homosexuals choose to be gay? And why then are there many species which exhibit homosexuality?
1,"Correct - I do not believe that homosexuality is a natural thing. I think I stated that. I also, however, don't believe that most homosexuals ""choose"" to be gay. I think that there are many factors that create a state in which one's mind opens to certain desires, and for whatever reason becomes infatuated with it. It then becomes very ""natural"" to that person. I can respect that in lieu of a more substantiated theory. The fact that there are occurances of this in life only supports the notion that this anomoly exists in more than the human race. We should study the similarities to understand what this better. All that being said, I do not believe that it is very American to disallow marriage based on homosexual tendancies or persuasions, regardless of what I think is ""right""."
1,"While I am glad you do not support restricting rights based upon your own perception of morality, I encourage you to do research on the nature of homosexuality. The American Psychiatric Association defines homosexuality as a normal variant of sexuality. It wouldn't really described as an anomaly. Approximately 10% of the human population is homosexual, and homosexuality has been linked to genetic factors. It is a natural thing that has been observed in approximately 1500 other species."
2,"Opposing gay adoption preserves traditional family as ideal for child-rearing. Just as married couples receive tax benefits and unmarried mothers may suffer cuts in welfare, legal prohibition of adoption by gays is a natural step towards this ideal. The traditional nuclear family is still an ideal that should be clung to, and which deserves the protection and motivation of the state. Evolution and nature has shown that the natural development of the young is aided by both these influences. 
"
1," Homophobia is wrong so should not be used against gay adoption  Couples from ethnic minorities are not barred from adoption even in racist areas. Only through the full inclusion of gays in society and all its institutions can we hope to overcome prejudice.
"
1,"“As I see it the only difference is that the gay person has shunned and is unable to interact with the only other existing species of human on the earth. No different?????????l”First… in what way has a ‘gay’ person shunned anyone by being gay?  Can you describe exactly how not sleeping with someone is shunning them?Second… What other species?  Men and women are members of the same species, H.Sapiens"
2,So do you think brothers and sisters should be able to be married?
1,"Of course they should. What justification is there for recognising one couple's commitment to each other and not another couple's, when they are committed to the same values? Doesn't denying them the same benefits as mixed sex couples constitute a form of sexual descrimination?"
1,"I don't really see why not. I mean, they pay taxes and deal with all of the bullshit the rest of the country does every day. Denying them something is basically making them sub-human, and that's pretty sick I think."
1,"By keeping homosexuals from marrying, you are sending the message that something is wrong with them.To say that they deserve to marry is insane. It isn't a matter of deserving. It is a matter of fair and equal treatment under the law.Some day, in the future, we will look back at the people who opposed homosexual marriage the same way we view those who opposed interracial marriage or the right of the mentally disabled to marry.Since a marriage is a government identified institution, the government MUST treat all citizens equally and afford everyone the same opportunities."
1,"There is only one thing I think should be considered here: equality.And the Civil Rights Act, which I'm pretty sure demanded respect for people, no matter what sexuality."
1,"yes! you rock gay people. they are people just like we are and if two men want to marry each other, than go for it"
2,I'm assuming your a fag yourself? I hate FAGS they need to DIE and stop being gay whats the world coming to?
1,"hi darlin im not gay either but you know you really ought to come to our next mardi gras...but if you do, dont be a little poof about it ,we will reserve a little spot just for you on the ""rednecks prefer there momma"" float.or is it your sisaunt this week..... make sure you wear your guns loud and clear, we dont want to waste time looking for them when it comes to the sthpectactular finally of ramning them up your bullridden assthes....i hate you and you need to grow up.....btw After finding out about the male g spot and where it is supposedly located are you still haveing trouble finding yours and this is why your all cut up with gay hate. have a Gay DAy:) oh my mate BEN DOVER says to say hello.and can he have your number."
1,Yes gay people should have that right they are no different then us except there sexuality.
1,A gay guy wanting to marry in a christian church is like a black guy wanting to join the Ku Klux KlanBut Id rather want gay christians to marry then heterosexual christians for gay christians cant have children so they cant spread their stupid beliefs as much as heterosexualsIn terms of going to a city council and get married (for legal reasons) I think any couple regardless of sex should be able to get a certificate of that under law
1,"that Florida has no problem with gay foster parents only with gay   adoption  . It's not about whats good for the child but, like   gay marriage  , being hung-up on a word."
1,"No, It's not.Gays can be Christian, and can be welcome in certain churches."
2,"""be welcome""name me 3... or no, name me two (2) churches (""tax deduced"" churces)in america that marry gay guys"
1,"Since when is government 'approval' (for lack of a better word, perhaps, regarding being tax-exempt) an acceptable litmus test for the legitimacy of a church?Put another way, Jesus wasn't exactly the Romans' favorite person..."
2,"I am not arguing about that. - But churches that are exempt from taxes have political power while ones who dont; dontand Gays having the right to marry I think is a human rights/political issueand about the Jesus comment: very true, but there was no organized church around jesus until 384 ADChurch (an institution that has the right to legally marry someone) is not exactly the same thing as a Religion (a creed of some sort)"

1,"Yes.Here's why: there's this one quote in the movie 'What happens in Vegas' that I effin admire... the judge declares that it's not gays that ruin marriage, but people that go to Vegas (or a place similar to it, or no where really) and get married on impulse, and then go on and get divorces... therefore, treating marriage like a bit, fat, joke.Seriously, marriages should be banned in places like Vegas, places loaded with alcohol and immature behavior, banned for people that have known each other, perhaps, for less than a year, people that treat marriage like a piece of shit. At LEAST gays are fighting for the goddamn thing out of respect, integrity, and love. So, yes, gays should have the right to marry because they're more serious about it than the common straight couple is. I don't care what's in between someone's fucking legs, it's the motives, desire, commitment and love that counts."
1,"I'm gonna have to say that it's untrue that gays are ""more serious about it than the common straight couple is.""Every couples is different, and straight, gay, bisexual, open, polygamous, whatever.... it's the individuals involved that make the relationship work. Not the ""mold"" it comes out of.I'd also like to defend Vegas Weddings. They're Cheap, and fun. I actually plan on having one, someday.You're so attached to stereotypes."
1,"Stereotypes are statistics. You wanna ignore stereotypes, then go ahead and ignore statistics too."
1,"the teacher is right in his / her assertion that ""it's ok to be gay"".  The only time it's not ok is when in the presence of the ignorant."
1,"Oh, gosh. That is so untrue.Stereotypes are a generalized perception of a group. Statistics are the products of actuality.They are completely different."
1,"stereotyping helps produce statistics. A statistic of approx 45% of all married couples divorcing someday, is a statistic based on a stereotype. In 2005, 57% of illegal immigrants in the US, are from Mexico, is therefore a statistic and a stereotype that at least half of illegal immigrants are Mexicans."
1,"No. Facts produce statistics.A statistic of approximately 45% of all married couples divorcing someday, would be based on already existing facts about divorce rates, not speculation. Stereotypes are based on opinions, random observations, and speculation.With statistics, there is control and reason, as well as numerical data.Stereotypes are just words."

1,"Legally speaking, all couples should be allowed to marry. All couples should have the legal benefits of marriage. Whether another persons religion or belief wants to call it marriage or not let that be. But for legal terms, all couples heterosexual or homosexual, should have the right to marriage.One last thought, what is so morally wrong with same sex marriage?"
1,"If you don't want a gay marriage, don't get one. what goes on behind closed doors goes on behind closed doors. As long as it's consensual, it's okay. End of story."
1,"hey, what a question is that? if he wants to do anything why do u care? they have a right to decide what they want to be. so its no harm. pay no attention to it!"
1,"As a matter of legality, they should be allowed the same rights and priveliges that married couples are allowed.However, if a church refuses to marry two people of the same gender, that is their own decision. The right to be married applies only to the legal recognition of the couple having the same legal status as a ""Married"" couple.Telling the church they can't reject homosexuality is oppressive. I'm all for gay marriage, but I'm even more against making people do what they don't want to do."
1,Why isn't it OK to be gay?
1,"Yes,they should have the rights to marry.....................afterall they are to humans not animals to be denied any rights......."
1,why not?? they are humans arnt they? they have right feelings for eachother they are loyal so i think they have equal rights of society... gay marriges are ok till they are ligal.......Himali.
2,got to know that you guys are KV students.if yes from where
1,"you have given me another opportunity to recover more data about alstars...You are interested in KV students????That sounds fishy, bcoz either u must be from KV or You must be having a close cousin studying in KVBy the way, what is KV?Kondom Vidhyalaya?Or Kiss me Vidhyalaya?"
1,"Yes. I don't agree with it but they should have the right to. If they don't it could cause big trouble and say we are racist or something (which we're not) But, they should have the right to marry. The poore people don't know any better. =("
1,Ok say you are a straight guy and you find you a nice wife and you guys live happy. Okay with gay people it is exactly the same except for it's the same sex. It doesnt matter what sex you are if you are happy you are happy and nobody should have the right to take that away! If two gay people want to finnally tie the knot then it shouldn't be a problem because they are very happy with one another just how straight guys would be with their wives! they should have a right to marry because it's their life that they are living and they should live it how ever they want to live it..... i think we should all accept that we have gays everywhere and killing their happiness so that we can be happy is so wrong...
1,Give me one reason i can't get married to my boyfriend of two years?Because we are the same sex? What does that have to do with anything?This shouldn't even be a question. This country sucks when it comes to this.
1,anyone should have the right to marry no matter what. there is nothing in the constitution stating it is wrong it is more of a religious belief. If you believe that they shouldnt you should keep it to yourself. everyone is equal and should be treated the same. how would you like it if it was the other way around and straight people couldnt marry other straight people
1,"it does not hurt anybody if they do get married. it does not affect me. there is no reason for them not be be married. if your reason is about religion, then it really depends what religion you are talking about. most people who are against gays are Christians, but then it depends on the church. i know that some churches allow gay marriage such as the united church of Christ or the Quaker group. even if they didn't, gays could still get married in a court by a judge, in that case nobody would be hurt."
1,"OF COURSE GAYS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARRY!!!!When its love, it has no limits, right? They shouldn't be discriminated against over something so personal. Its their life and people shouldn't interfere with a persons right to privacy and decision no matter whether or not they're the same sex. And to tell you the truth its not their fault being gay, their born with it. It a mental thing. Their normal people! I don't get how people can say otherwise."
2,"a basic tenet of   education   is to teach both what is and what is not. therefore, in order to grow up normally as an adult male, a boy needs to learn via observing his parents know how to be a man, and how not to be a woman. conversely, a girl in order for her to grow up normally needs to seeing how it is to become a woman, and how not to become a man."
1,"Going by the history and the need for marriage from the days of the caveman and before, I would think that the institution of marriage is meant more as a protection for the children that result from the instinctive act of sex. Civilized society would have decided long ago, that there was a need to protect the offspring and therefore sanctified marriage through religion etc., The importance of marriage is therefore for the protection of all children and to provide for them through the responsibility attached to the marrying couples in exchange for the previlige of having their own children. There are legal rights attached to children and the heterosexual marrying couples such as succession of property etc., Obviously a marriage of gays is meaningless in this context, and serves no purpose and also has no liability on the society at large. If they want to co habitate for their mutual pleasure, then they are just in the same position as a heterosexual couple who dont have any children - either by their own choice or by happenstance.So, let them get married if they want to, it has no harmful consequence on any one."
1,"ya. The onlything that should matter in marriage is love. if you can prove you love him or her than you should be aloud to marry (family or relivtives don't count, i doubt many people out there would support that, not even rednecks)"
1,"yes! you rock gay people. they are no different than we are. if to men want to marry each other, go for it"
1,"I believe people have two fundamental rights relating to this issue:The right to self expression and personal views/ideas.The right to be secure physically and emotionally.If someone gets married -gay or straight-, they are expression their personal ideas. This is their RIGHT in Canada and the United States, at the very least. Marriage is a legal thing between two people, and the only part of it that says it has to be man and a woman lies in religion- which is based on ideas founded centuries ago when women were considered objects anyway, and thus fundamentally flawed and not viable as the final word.If you are telling them that they are not allowed to get married, you are first of all denying them their right to express their ideas by saying it's not allowed, and secondly denying them their emotional security because you're descriminating.FINALLY. What does it matter to you if a gay couple gets married? Is it hurting you? No. Is it denying you the ability to say you don't like it? No. Is it infringing on those two rights for you? No. You can disagree with it, but that doesn't mean you should have the right to say it's not allowed at all!There's no logical reason to say it isn't allowed."
1,"People should be allowed to marry whoever they want (age permitting, of course). They should also be allowed to fight and die for their country."
1,"Well, they actually do have the right to get married.I think a better wording would be ""Should people have the right to marry someone of the same sex""."
1,"Okay so when interracial marriage was illegal would you have said ""It's alright because anyone does have the right to get married [just not to whom they want]""?"
1,I bet he says he would have.He needs the attention just that much.
1,He will probably say interracial marriage and same-sex marriage are completely different even though they are quite similar.
1,"Maybe... but I think he likes to offend, because he doesn't have anything better to add to a debate."
1,"That is an interesting hypothesis... but the evidence does not support your claims, rather it shows that   children   in same sex families are as well adjusted as those in heterosexual families."
1,I wouldn't put it past him. I kind of feel bad for him though. His worldview seems awfully depressing.
1,"No, i was merely criticizing the set up of the question. Gays do have the right to marry.Damn... is it just because you and Pineapple have a problem with me? Cause this is absurd."
2,"You did not answer my question. If everything is peachy because gays have the right to marry, then doesn't that same logic apply to interracial marriage?"
1,"I wasn't saying that gay marriage was bad in the first place... I was saying that the question isn't the question that should be asked. To relate it to you interracial question, it would be like asking ""Should blacks have the right to marry?"""
1,"You knew exactly what the debate meant by ""Should gays have the right to get marry?"" Instead you took the pedantic route and contributed nothing to the debate.And my reference to interracial marriage was saying that if you think it is okay to have same-sex marriage be illegal because gays still have a right to get married than you should be okay with interracial marriage being illegal."
1,"I knew what the debate meant, but since this debate has been brought up about a thousand times, I should do something different. So I instead pointed out how the title is misleading and is missing the point of the whole gay marriage debate.If anything, i've contributed even more by saying something different than from the usual routine. and as I pointed out, if this were an interracial issue, the title would have been ""should blacks have the right to marry?"" which would have also been misleading.Don't see why everyone has to make such a big deal out of this. Too much tension on this site sometimes... everything always has to be taken offensively. I support gay marriage, if that's the issue here."
1,That is implied. Please learn yourself on a subject before making stupid and disrupting comments.You're not Joe.
1,"How do you debate a topic that has a different meaning from what is implied?What we're technically supposed to talk about here is ""should gays have the right to marry?"" but I know no one wants to talk about that, since that isn't the hot button issue.Joe would have made a comment that made no sense or would have joked around. While I joke around, this post was not a joke and made perfect sense.It's sad that people criticize it."
1,"It's sad that you're arguing it.Please tell me that most of the dipshit comments you've made were jokes. Because I'd like you to know, you can't hear sarcasm over the internet.You may want to be an ass, and it may make you giggle, but it's not funny."

1,"I'll tell you what, the best thing that my parents ever did for me was get divorced, yes it was rough on my single mom and hard for me to comprehend, but they would have eventually killed each (literally) had they stayed together. Something that cracks me up is a comment about   kids   with divorced parents never wishing that their parents had same sex partners...watching my dad be emotionally abusive to all his girlfriends and my mom be emotionally abused by all her boyfriends, in hindsight I bet had my parents had same sex relationships things would have gone a lot smoother. I think that might even be true of them today, watching them in their current relationships. I don't care where   babies   come from; what's most important is that they are loved when they get here. Whether you're gay, straight, bi-curious or a unicorn, if you are comfortable with who you are and you can pass that on to your kid, the lesson is not ""be like me"" the lesson is ""be yourself"". If two people who love each other are willing to invest positive time and   energy   into their   children  , it doesn't matter whether one is a man and the other a woman, a child just needs to be loved, respected and allowed to have a chance at a happy childhood. There are so many reasons why this argument is ridiculous...I could go on and on but I don't want to hog all the space.My Questions for You: *Do gay people really wish gay-dom on their children, knowing the adversity they may face in their future?*Isn't being molested as a young person more likely to effect your sexuality (in any regard) in your future more so than having two loving parents who happen to be of the same sex?* Do you think that adopted children are thinking ""my parents are pushing their gay agenda down my throat and that is too heavy a burden for [me] to carry and it is in my opinion criminal"" (according to Hope7) or do you think they are thinking ""hey i have two parents who love me, awesome"".....?*Does the phrase ""it takes a village to raise a child"" actually mean a bunch of same sex couples or does it really just mean a positive support system, made up of people who have the child's best interest in mind?"
1,"Being brought up by two lesbian parents and being a boy with no male role model in my life (other than gay friends of my mom's) i would have to say that it does not put you at a disadvantage.Kids will pick on you for a huge list of reasons. If that means i was saved from names such as 'big head' or 'four eyes' because   children   would choose to focus on the sexual orrientation of my parents, so be it.Both my moms gave me love and attention and supported me through   education  , relationships and anything they could.I must say that i am a very camp man but i harbor no homosexual desires, im completely straight. This is without any heterosexual influence.Now im in my late   teens  , i didnt go to   college  , unfortunatly but instead i work in a large investment bank, earning as much as any  graduate in my job.In conclusion having gay parents hasnt affected me, i have a nice job, a beautifull   girlfriend   and im debt free. This is all the product of the so called 'broken home'"
1,"Children raised by homosexuals may become more tolerant individuals. American Academy of Pediatrics - ""growing up with parents who are lesbian or gay may confer some advantages to children. They have been described as more tolerant of diversity,""
"
1,"I grew up the oldest boy out of three, in a Midwest model American home with a   mother   and a father until the age of twelve.  Up until then I believed everything was just as perfect and I would have to say that I was probably at an advantage over most of the other families I knew, simply because of the fact that we were all still a family.  One day my father caught my mother cheating on him with another female.  Now, kudos to both of them because I will have to say they did one heck of a job keeping us three   kids   out of the mess that had been created.  Of course, divorce followed and soon I watched our family crumble into pieces from that day forward.  I knew what was going on, but I never brought it up.  It was a little embarrassing, so as far as everyone else, I was just a good kid going through tough time at home. Eventually, my mother came out to us and it was not different than it was before.  For two-thirds of the time under my parents roof, everything was great.  The last third was a mess!!  Not because, she was gay, or even the fact that I was gay, it was the ugly, messy divorce.  The odd thing was that my father never really met anyone until many years later, but my mother had a   girlfriend   who lived with her.  I am here to tell you now that homes with two parents, any parents whether they are gay, straight, blue or brown, are the ones at an advantage.  For the most part I was better off living with my mother and her girlfriend than with my father, not because   money  , or lifestyle, or anything else.  It was simply because of the single parent home versus the two parent home factor.  It was hell going through all of that, and the only thing that put me at a disadvantage was the divorce.  "
1,This post is almost insulting in its complete lack of evidence or even a reasoned argument.  Merely dismissing the other side is not an argument.
1,"Sorry, buster, but this makes no sense. The evidence has all been refuted big time, and I was raised by my dad and my brother. My mom was a wacko alcoholic who thankfully didn't raise me. Yes, I had an unhappy childhood, but it would've been ten times worse has my mom been there - she's anything but motherly. Now that I'm in college away from my mom, I am as happy as can be. My first roommate, a girl, has been like a mother to me and made a much happier person out of me, but I'm also sexually attracted to her, so try to use your puny evidence to prove which one of those matters!!! And don't tell me that I'm attracted to her only because I never had a mother... that couldn't explain what being one of the happiest people in the world has to do with disadvantages in childhood."
2,"Did you ever try to find out why your   mother   is an alcoholic? Did you ever consider the ammount of love she has in her heart for you and that she knows shes a failure....WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LOVE that the homosexual community profess to have. Love your Mom and honor her no matter what kind of a mother she is and you will receive a blessing. No ones mother was ever perfect and you are fooling no one with the Im better without her and   college   is making me so happy. BS. You are hurting because you didnt get the love you needed in life and that was unfair to you. You want your mother to be what you need her to be and your child inside is crying to have her hold you and tell you that she loves you and you want to be able to trust and believe that you can rely on her and not be disappointed by her. Believe me she wants that too. If I was you Id grow and take your life into your own hands and make up with her even if you know she will never be reliable as a mother because someday she wont be there and you will regret not having had the nerve to walk up to her and say I FORGIVE YOU MOM...and until then dont blame the world for your chips and insecurities...YOU CHOOSE THE LIFE YOU WANT TO CHOOSE just be adult enough to own it. Gd bless you. Find a   church  . Quit drowning your sorrows in   alcohol   and partying, they wont go away that way and youll only compound your pain and suffering. Thats my motherly   advice   to you."
2,sacrificing your life to a pagan false Gd...is that really truely what you intened to do with your life? I choose Gd and that means I reject the notion that   homosexuality   is normal and pleasing to Gd!
2,"Dr. Crawford highlights all of the facts that we all know to be true.  All of his statements supporting his opinion are simply characteristics of our human nature.  Few creatures on this earth do not look out for the wellfare their offsprings.  However, the primary premise of raising children is not to make us feel good, but to promote procreation and continuation of the species.  As childern grow up they see their parents as role models whether good or bad.  Homosexual households are simply sending the wrong message to the maturing child."
1,"By your 'logic', only those who are both capable of having children and fit into your idea of a role model should be allowed to marry or adopt, I'm guessing.And these are not facts we all know to be true. Quite a few of these are outright lies or opinion. For example, your idea that the parents should be straight so the kids will be straight--and how many children of gay parents turn out gay? Did this 'fact' of yours just not apply when the gay parents themselves were raised by their straight parents? Most of all, how does this even begin to put kids at a disadvantage?"
1,"There are countless   children   waiting to be adopted.  Many more children than hetero couples to adopt them.  The choice for these children isn't whether it's better to grow up in a hetero or homo family.  The choice is whether it's better to grow up in a homo family, or no family.  The choice is obvious.  "
1,I think you're making the wrong comparisons. You are comparing children born into a married heterosexual family to everyone else. However the question posed is to compare children born into a homosexual family to everyone else. Its clear that you have no research that supporting your argument but you try to spin other research to help you out.
1,"Seeing how our son graduated with honors from UC Berkeley in the Fall, and is currently doing research via a Fulbright Fellowship in Africa and hopes to go on to graduate school, nope. We are more normal than is his girlfriend (who has a kid of three years) and her family both parents divorced a few times. All my GLBT parent colleagues report similar findings.  Now as a professor, absolutely ALL of the extremely messed up, problematic kids come from heterosexual “traditional” families.  As well, in the local high school I both volunteer in and do research with a teacher in, all the kids involved in gang oriented drug violent behavior come from “traditional” families, and despite being minorities, are the most homophobic and violent  kids I have ever  tried to work with. Thought folks would like to know… that when we talk of traditional families, the tradition doesn’t seem to be working so well.  Earlier, I asked my son about this debate and he only laughed."
2," Children adopted by gays are subjected to homophobia/prejudices Homophobic language and behaviour is still common in society. Placing a child too young to have an opinion of their own in the care of a gay couple exposes them to this prejudice, and subjects them to ridicule or violence. Whatever ideal we might have, the psychological and physical welfare of the child must come first.

Empirical evidence reveals in contrast that gay fathers have substantial evidence of nurturance and investment in their paternal role and no differences from heterosexual fathers in providing appropriate recreation, encouraging autonomy,5 or dealing with general problems of parenting.6 Compared with heterosexual fathers, gay fathers have been described to adhere to stricter disciplinary guidelines, to place greater emphasis on guidance and the development of cognitive skills, and to be more involved in their children’s activities.7 Overall, there are more similarities than differences in the parenting styles and attitudes of gay and nongay fathers.Similarly, few differences have been found in the research from the last 2 decades comparing lesbian and heterosexual mothers’ self-esteem, psychologic adjustment, and attitudes toward child rearing.8,9 Lesbian mothers fall within the range of normal psychologic functioning on interviews and psychologic assessments and report scores on standardized measures of self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and parenting stress indistinguishable from those reported by heterosexual mothers.10Lesbian mothers strongly endorse child-centered attitudes and commitment to their maternal roles11–13 and have been shown to be more concerned with providing male role models for their children than are divorced heterosexual mothers.6,14 Lesbian and heterosexual mothers describe themselves similarly in marital and maternal interests, current lifestyles, and child-rearing practices.14 They report similar role conflicts, social support networks, and coping strategies.15,16""The problem here is that people assume same-sex parents are bad for the children because they're biased against gays, not because they have any actual reason to think so."

1,"To tell the truth, when someone uses the phrase ""to tell the truth"" they're usually not telling the truth.  "
1,"...in this ""debate"" is the state that   children   typically are in when they come to same-sex parents for foster care or   adoption  . My   kids   had been in and out of foster care eight times before they were permanently placed with us. My husband and I had to address years of abusive behavior, domestic violence that had been witnessed in previous homes, etc., with our kids. All of those things happened during their critical formative years, and the damage of all of them is difficult, if not impossible, to undo completely. And this is just one of many realities that Focus dismisses, ignores or rationalizes to support its political interests. If Focus were truly concerned about the welfare of kids, it would devote resources to placing more of them in loving homes rather than trying to undermine the ability of GLBT parents to be good parents to their foster and adoptive kids.Let's be clear: I didn't make my kids. A heterosexual couple did. And that same couple abused, neglected and ultimately abandoned them. They are my children and my husband's children now. And we are ""serving their best interests"" in ways that have literally meant salvation for them both. Focus and other far-right, anti-gay groups continually distort data regarding gay and lesbian parents to the degree that to call them ""experts"" in this area is like calling the Klan experts in race relations. "
1,"I've read all the arguments and Focus on the Family had 1 excellent point.  ""the more precise question is “disadvantaged compared to what?”.  After they say that they go on and on about how great it is when   kids   are raised by their married biological mom and dad.  You know what, they may be right about that.  On average (certainly not in every case but on average) kids are probably better off being raised by their married biological parents (BTW, those married biological parents could be gay).  Thing is, that's not an option for these kids.  Their biological parents can't, or won't, raise them anymore.  Kids that are up for   adoption   aren't being pulled out of the homes of perfectly good married heterosexual parents.  Kids that are up for adoption are in orphanages, or bouncing around from one foster home to another.  I think we can all agree that's not an ideal way for a kid to grow up.  So the real question isn't whether having straight parents is better than having gay parents.  The question is, is it better to bounce from foster home to foster home, never living with the same parents for more than a few years, never setting down roots and making long term family or friend connections, or, is it better for a child to be raised by a loving gay couple who want to love them, and take care of them throughout their childhood.  Personally I think it's obviously better to be raised by loving gay parents but you can all make your own decision.  The important thing is that you make that decision based on the facts, not some scare tactics FOTF is throwing out.  The choice isn't married straight parents or gays.  The choice is orphanage/foster care or gays.  Which do you think is better?"
2,"According to Love Isn’t Enough: 5 Reasons Why Same-Sex Marriage Will Harm Children By Trayce Hansen, Ph.D.Hansen sites these five reasons in her article. 1.First, mother-love and father-love—though equally important—are qualitatively different and produce distinct parent-child attachments. Specifically, it’s the combination of the unconditional-leaning love of a mother and the conditional-leaning love of a father that’s essential to a child’s development. Either of these forms of love without the other can be problematic. Because what a child needs is the complementary balance the two types of parental love and attachment provide.2. Only heterosexual parents offer   children   the opportunity to develop relationships with a parent of the same, as well as the opposite sex. Relationships with both sexes early in life make it easier for a child to relate to both sexes later in life. For a girl, that means she’ll better understand and appropriately interact with the world of men and be more comfortable in the world of women. And for a boy, the converse will hold true. Having a relationship with “the other”—an opposite sexed parent—also increases the likelihood that a child will be more empathetic and less narcissistic.Overall, fathers play a restraining role in the lives of their children. They restrain sons from acting out antisocially, and daughters from acting out sexually. When there’s no father to perform this function, dire consequences often result both for the fatherless children and for the   society   in which these children act out their losses.3.Third, boys and girls need an opposite-sexed parent to help them moderate their own gender-linked inclinations. As example, boys generally embrace reason over emotion, rules over relationships, risk-taking over caution, and standards over compassion, while girls generally embrace the reverse. An opposite-sexed parent helps a child keep his or her own natural proclivities in check by teaching—verbally and nonverbally—the worth of the opposing tendencies. That teaching not only facilitates moderation, but it also expands the child’s world—helping the child see beyond his or her own limited vantage point.4.Fourth,   same-sex marriage   will increase sexual confusion and sexual experimentation by young people. The implicit and explicit message of same-sex marriage is that all choices are equally acceptable and desirable.5. The emotional and psychological ramifications of these assorted arrangements on the developing psyches and sexuality of children would be disastrous. And what happens to the children of these alternative marriages if the union dissolves and each parent then “remarries”? Those children could end up with four fathers, or two fathers and four mothers, or, you fill in the blank.Certainly homosexual couples can be just as loving as heterosexual couples, but children require more than love. They need the distinctive qualities and the complementary natures of a male and female parent. end of articleI think Hansen does a fine job in conveying the dangers of homosexual   parenting  .

1,"The problem with going with your ideas is...well, there are a few.Firstly, in regards to points 1, 2, and 3. If those assertions were true, the heirarchy of effective   parenting   would be, at the top, heterosexual parents. Underneath that would be same-sex parents. Underneath that would be single parents. Do you believe that single parents deserve   kids   more than same-sex couples? If so, why?In regards to point 4, that's just not true. There's no higher incidence of   homosexuality   with same-sex parents than there is with heterosexual parents.RE: Gender Identity. In studies of   children   ranging in age from 5 to 14, results of projective testing and related interview procedures have revealed that development of gender identity among children of lesbian mothers follows the expected pattern (Green, 1978; Green, Mandel, Hotvedt, Gray, & Smith, 1986; Kirkpatrick, Smith & Roy, 1981). More direct assessment techniques to assess gender identity have been used by Golombok, Spencer, & Rutter (1983) with the same result: All children in this study reported that they were happy with their gender and that they had no wish to be a member of the opposite sex. There was no evidence in any of the studies of gender identity of any difficulties among children of lesbian mothers. No data have been reported in this area for children of gay fathers.RE: Gender-Role Behavior. A number of studies have reported that gender-role behavior among children of lesbian mothers fell within typical limits for conventional sex roles (Brewaeys et al., 1997; Golombok et al., 1983; Gottman, 1990; Green, 1978; Green et al., 1986; Hoeffer, 1981; Kirkpatrick et al., 1981; Kweskin & Cook, 1982; Patterson, 1994a). For instance, Kirkpatrick and her colleagues (1981) found no differences between children of lesbian versus heterosexual mothers in toy preferences, activities, interests, or occupational choices.RE: Sexual Orientation.  A number of investigators have also studied a third component of sexual identity, sexual orientation (Bailey, Bobrow, Wolfe, & Mickach, 1995; Bozett, 1980, 1987, 1989; Gottman, 1990; Golombok & Tasker, 1996; Green, 1978; Huggins, 1989; Miller, 1979; Paul, 1986; Rees, 1979; Tasker & Golombok, 1997). In all studies, the great majority of offspring of both lesbian mothers and gay fathers described themselves as heterosexual. Taken together, the data do not suggest elevated rates of homosexuality among the offspring of lesbian or gay parents. For instance, Huggins (1989) interviewed 36 adolescents, half of whom had lesbian mothers and half of whom had heterosexual mothers. No children of lesbian mothers identified themselves as lesbian or gay, but one child of a heterosexual mother did; this difference was not statistically significant. In another study, Bailey and his colleagues (1995) studied adult sons of gay fathers and found more than 90% of the sons to be heterosexual.Golombok and Tasker (1996, 1997) studied 25 young adults reared by divorced lesbian mothers and 21 young adults reared by divorced heterosexual mothers. They reported that offspring of lesbian mothers were no more likely than those of heterosexual mothers to describe themselves as feeling attracted to same-sex sexual partners. If they were attracted in this way, however, young adults with lesbian mothers were more likely to report that they would consider entering into a same-sex sexual relationship, and they were more likely to have actually participated in such a relationship. They were not, however, more likely to identify themselves as non-heterosexual (i.e., as lesbian, gay, or bisexual). These results were based on a small sample, and they must be interpreted with caution. At the same time, the study is the first to follow children of divorced lesbian mothers into adulthood, and it offers a detailed and careful examination of important issues.And regarding point 5, that's the issue with every divorce. Homosexual marriages aren't more likely to split up than heterosexual marriages--At least, there's no evidence saying so."

1,"Most, if not all, of Focus on the Family's ""research"" which they use to ""prove"" that gay-parented families are inferior to straight-parented families are studies of children being raised either in single-parent homes because their parents were divorced or they were abandoned by one of their parents, or of children being raised in ""blended"" step-families.  Such familial situations may very well NOT be ideal for raising children, but poor outcomes from such blended or single-parent families does not by any means equate to poor outcomes for children raised in stable, two-parent, loving, nurturing homes where the parents are of the same gender.The studies of children raised in stable, loving, two-same-gendered parent homes show that such children are equally as happy, healthy and thriving as children raised in equivalent opposite-gendered-parent homes."

It is ridiculous.Focus on the Family has but one goal -- to convince the world that gays are sinful perverts, sexual deviants, who should not have the same rights as heterosexuals.

Regardless of family type, adolescents were more likely to show favorable adjustment when they perceived more caring from adults and when parents described close relationships with them.

1,"In the previous argument the title states "" Research Indicates Children Do Best When Raised By Married Mom & Dad."" Yet this argument says that no reliable research indicates   children   in same sex homes do as well. Now clear something up for me. If there is ""reliable"" research to indicate an outcome in any comparison, there has to be reliable research based on the other end of that comparison. That means you can't say that   kids   do best with mom and dad and then say that there is no reliable research to the contrary. Either the first statement is made up, or the second is a lie. Lastly, how is this research performed? Who conducted it and what are the standards? None of this info is given. I, for one, was raised in a mom and dad household. And one that lived by Focus on the Family, none the less. However, I want to pull my hair out thinking about my upbringing. Going by textbook FOTF living, resulted in a pregnant teenage sister who got kicked out of high school, a gay brother, and me. I left the home at 16 and slept in my car at the park. My friend? Grew up with two dads. She excelled in school, is happily married to her   military   husband, and is well on her way to her Masters. Now tell me again. What are the standards?"
1,"Because of all the ""rules and regulations"", and headache that comes with being a gay parent, there doesn't really seem to be too many of them.  But I promise this, you can mark a tally under the yes column when the research does start.  I know I did the best I could regardless of my home situation."
1,"The entire premise of this argument rests on the premise that the current debate is analogous to a decision made 40 years ago, referred to as the Divorce Experiment.  I am extremely skeptical of this assertion since divorce has existed for thousands of years and there has been no mention of who participated in or initiated this experiment.The remaining point made in this argument seems to be that divorce is hard on children, and I wholeheartedly agree, but without any proof of the assertion of a similarity between the two ""Experiments"", the rest of the argument is a non sequitur.If you read this comment, could you please explain what you mean?"
1,"This argument has been used many times before and with equal disingenuousness.  This was the same argument used against interracial marriage -- ""What about the CHILDREN???? :gasp:""  Research DOES show that the children of same-gender parents do equally as well as the children of opposite-gender parents.  The only ""research"" which disputes this is the mocked-up garbage disseminated by Focus on the Family, which draws upon studies of children raised by a single parent, generally as the result of traumatic divorce or abandonment.  Stop with the gasping and eyelash fluttering and start speaking the truth for a change.  "
1,"This debate is about same sex parenting, not the effects of divorce on children. Yes, it is true that same-sex parents all have step-families by default, but many (most?) times these are step-families since the time of the child's birth. I am assuming that most of this divorce research is done on children who are at some stage of development past the first year, when heterosexual parental bonding has already occurred. It appears this entire argument is invalid to the topic."
1,"Pat, I agree with everything you say here, except the point that all gay parents have step-families by default.  Unless we consider that a heterosexual couple who creates their family by use of donor sperm is creating ""step-children,"" then we cannot say this about lesbian couples who do the same, or gay men who conceive their children by way of a surrogate.  We don't consider straight couples who use a surrogate mom to be step-parents.  In fact, we don't even consider straight couples who adopt to be step-parents.  So, no, gay couples are not step-families by default.  There are all kinds of gay-parented families, just as there are all kinds of straight-parented families.  Really, there are just all kinds of families. :)Not, again, that I disagree with anything in the remainder of your post.  You are absolutely right that FOF tries to turn this into a comparison of families parenting biological children vs. families parenting children as a result of divorce or abandonment, and that is a ridiculous comparison to make as ""proof"" that gays are ""inadequate"" or ""substandard"" parents."

1,"so what you were saying about divorce is it is better for a child to witness the pain and stress of the   parents   in the home and most likely suffer from   depression   because of it? you beleive it is better for a child to be in a situation were they do not receive full love from the parents or were the only time they get attention is when parents are trying to get back at one another? oh and so you know according to research in pyschology and child devolpment, it is better for a child to have parents who love them, respect them, and will be able to provide physical and emotional needs."

2,"We can only speak from experience and conjecture.  Anecdotes, unfortunately, are all we have right now when talking about this topic.  If there was some way to objectively gauge whether a child being raised in a   safe  , secure and calm heterosexual home was any better-off (or perhaps worse-off) than a child being raised in a safe, secure and calm homosexual home then we could talk about this topic intelligently.  All we can do right now is make analogies and comparisons while talking about our own conjecture and limited experiences.  I am personally witnessing a boy being raised in a lesbian home and have been watching him grow for the last 15 years (he is 15 years old).  The couple raising him are very intelligent and caring individuals, but there just seems something odd about the young man, the way he acts and talks, the things he says, are all odd, I will not go into detail, however, there definitely is something off about him.  Beyond that, I am not even sure it is causal, perhaps he would have been odd if raised by a heterosexual couple, I cannot know this, however, in the current lack of knowledge that we have as a culture, I am opposed to homosexual   parenting  . "
1,"Focus on the Family is correct in stating that taking children away from their natural parents and giving them to a homosexual couple to be raised in some bizarre social experiment would be unethical.  That is not what anyone is suggesting, however.  What is the question is whether children would be better off being adopted by a loving homosexual couple instead of being left to a foster home or government program in the event that no one else is there to care for them.  While one could argue back and forth all day about whether being adopted by a heterosexual or homosexual couple makes a difference, and admittedly it probably does, there is little doubt that loving parents of any sexuality would be better than the alternative.  The problem with this debate is that no one is willing to forget their own biases and prejudices and think about the kids.  They can't seem to get past what they want for themselves or what their religion/society tells them is wrong."
2,Fundamentally same sex marriage is based on the rejection of the other sex. It is not in the interest of society to support that concept.Discussing if an abandoned child would be better in a same sex home than whitout a home missing the point and the long term consequences.It is the same with divorces. We cant use the exceptions to justify them because we ended up with no fault divorces laws and broke the heart of 42 millions children. Some of them after seeing their parents separating are now choosing the homosexual lifestyle. And now we are discussing same sex marriages. We need ot go back to the causes and stop trying to fix the symptoms.
2,"I believe that somewhere along the way someone's emotional development can be altered or misdirected.Same sex love is fruitless and cannot multiply. There is no descendance and no future blood lineage. In the case of 2 magnets the + side reject the + side but join the - side.Do not just disreguard what I am saying lightly.It is the same with children. When I hear an adult saying: I do not like children but I love dogs or my cat is like my baby. I wander what happened in their life for them to speak that way.The issue of abandonned children is a separate subject. In any case, some studies show that when children are raised by homosexuals, the chance for them to become homosexual or bisexuals increase 7X.(from 2% to 14% of the population). We are just increasing the problem of homsexualityDo we have to create new organisations that will provide a mother or a father figure for these children like big borthers or big sister.I do no buy the idea that a lesbian will play Dad while her partner will play mom successfullyWe are just multiplying the problem for these children and the suffering that homosexuals say they endure because of their condition.Still in order to satisfy your request for me to answer your question, I like to say the following.I do no know the specific data but I hear that 500,000 children are in the family services' care.250,000 or more are still connected to their original families and half of the 250,000 left are not small babies but are more dificult to adopt because they are older or have been abused or hurt in some fashion.The answer is to raise the consciousness of the whole country on this issue big time and mobilise all the goodness in the USA to tackle this problem.Most people are not aware of it.Instead of adopting children, people with same sex attraction should be helped in healing themselves.

2,"I am sorry to say but since the beginning of time the fruit of love between a man and a woman comes out as a child. It is not a question of being for procreation or trying to save the environment through homosexuality. That is way to intellectual of an explanationThe child is from both parents, looks like both parents. The child is in the father and the father is in the child. Same as for the mother. Anyone who go through that experience feels that it is a miracle.For me the issue of homosexuality is wrong. It is no about being different. I do not think that there is a person on the face of the earth who has not stuggled with her or his sexuality. It is not an exclusivity of people dealing with same sex attactions.In my personal beliefs, I do have a reason for this situation. That is not the subject of this post.I do beliefs that men (masculin) and women (feminin) express their love different for their children in a complementary way. We all experience that. Women can see from early age that boys and girls are different.Gender roles are affected by the culture people live in but they are real. People who ignore them suffer a lot in their marriages and learn it the hard way. You can recreate the world to fit you personal views.I think that you are fighting the universe itself, not me.I do not have ill feelings towards homosexuals. It does not mean that I have to agree with you just to please you.On the issue of adoption, it is not on top of the list of the causes celebre like breast cancer or aids and others. The study on the increase in homosexual behaviors if someone was raised in a ss home was made available by focus on the family. I do not have a copy with me. It is available on the web. It does make a lot of common sense since children do imitate what they parents do.  "

1,"Cool.  If you can cross-post, I can cross-post too.  (Oh yeah, and you have comments waiting in the other place you made this post.)""Perhaps the people polled were -not- chosen at random. Perhaps the people polled were pulled from parts of the country where promiscuity, drug use, alcohol, etc. were already rampant. Did the study report their findings on opposite-sex couples within their sample?Furthermore, promiscuity, drug use, alcohol, etc. could very well have been the result of homosexuality being perceived as a social stigma, in which case -homosexuality- is not causing the promiscuity, etc. but -social stigmas-.Or perhaps those are linked to lacking marriage. Are there studies that report these same variables with married and unmarried opposite-sex couples? I don't find this one to be a far cry from the truth either, because homosexuals would be promiscuous as a result of not needing to stay in a marriage.I -will- be satisfied with data once the data is sufficient and can counterbalance some of the data I've found. Until then, I don't think you can draw your conclusions without sticking the word ""premature"" in front of them.""Furthermore, it was demonstrated that some of the studies cited actually came from people polled within AIDS clinics and the like.Personally, I think hate crimes are a decent measure of how society responds to homosexuality:   http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm   (Table 1 for each year under Hate Crimes section) As you'll notice, hate crimes have neither had a dramatic increase or drop since 1995, suggesting that tolerance may only be getting -slightly- better (if we account for the population increase, though we have to counterbalance for cities lost within the samples). Furthermore, you and I both know that there's going to be a time-lag in the feedback system here. Information isn't spread instantaneously; people don't change their perception of themselves overnight.As for the data I've collected, it revolves around -parenting-, and to infer that -parenting- is closely enough related to -mental stability-... I don't think there's a close enough connection. In any case, I pulled the information from here: Psychosocial Adjustment, School Outcomes, and Romantic Relationships of Adolescents With Same-Sex Parents. Jennifer L. Wainright, Stephen T. Russell, and Charlotte J. Patterson. Child Development, 2004, Volume 75, Number 6, Pages 1886-1898.In the introduction, the author cites various other studies which I'm not particularly interested in, though the studies contend that same-sex parents have no effect on children's self esteem.I believe that the study only used forty-four families, though, so you'll have to realize that the sample might be too small and not representative of the community.“The results of the present study, which is the first based on a large national sample of adolescents living with same-sex couples, revealed that on nearly all of a large array of variables related to school and personal adjustment, adolescents with same-sex parents did not differ significantly from a matched group of adolescents living with opposite-sex parents. Regardless of family type, adolescents were more likely to show favorable adjustment when they perceived more caring from adults and when parents described close relationships with them. Thus, as has been reported in studies of children with lesbian mothers (e.g., Chan et al., 1998), it was the qualities of adolescent-parent relationships rather than the structural features of families (e.g., same vs. opposite-sex parents) that were significantly associated with adolescent adjustment (Golombok, 1999; Patterson, 2000).” p. 1895"
1,"“Across a diverse array of assessments, we found that the personal, family, and school adjustment of adolescents living with same-sex parents did not differ from that of adolescents living with opposite-sex parents. Consistent with the findings of earlier research (e.g., Huggins, 1989), we found that adolescent self-esteem did not vary as a function of family type. In addition, we found no differences as a function of family type in measures of personal adjustment, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety; in measures of school adjustment, such as academic achievement, trouble in school, or feelings of school connectedness; or in measures of the qualities of family relationships, such as autonomy, care from adults and peers, neighborhood integration, or parental warmth. The clarity of results from this broad array of assessments strengthens our confidence that adolescents living with same-sex parents were functioning well in many domains, both at home and at school.” p. 1895“Most adolescents in our sample reported having had a romantic relationship in recent months, but only a minority reported having had sexual intercourse; there were no significant differences in this regard as a function of family type.” p. 1895“An unexpected aspect of our results was the finding that adolescents' feelings of connectedness at school varied as a function of family type. Adolescents living with same-sex parents reported feeling more connected to school than did those living with opposite-sex parents. Inasmuch as school connectedness among adolescents has been associated with fewer problem behaviors and greater emotional well-being (Resnick et al., 1997), this finding suggests that adolescents with same-sex parents might be expected to show more favorable adjustment. For measures of adjustment such as self-esteem and depressive symptoms, however, we found no effects of family type. Consequently, the best interpretation of this intriguing finding remains unclear.” p. 1896However, we cannot conclusively say here that (1) same-sex parents are just as good for their children (due to small population size and the fact that ""good parents"" might be a result of other things like community, etc.) or (2) same-sex parents are just as mentally stable as opposite-sex parents.  http://www.ojp.gov/bjs/glance/viort.htm  Violent crimes have decreased, meaning that the trend towards the slight decrease in sexually oriented hate crimes might be a result of crimes decreasing across the board as opposed to more sexual-oriented-based tolerance."
1,I have no Idea whether it's better for a child to be raised by a homosexual or heterosexual couple but my gut feeling is there is no reason why a child raised by a Gay couple shouldn't be just as well adjusted as one raised by a traditional family.
1,"None of Focus on the Families arguments have any bearing on the argument.  They say kids are better off in married 2 parent households with their biological parents.  This is most likely true but the kids we're talking about have already been put up for adoption by their biological parents.  This is no longer an option for them.  The question we need to answer is whether they're better off in a gay household than an orphanage or bouncing from house to house in foster care.  Nobody can argue that  foster care or an orphanage is better than a loving home, whether the parents are straight, gay, black, white, religious atheist or anything else.They also argue that divorce is bad for children.  No kidding!  Again, that has no bearing on the argument.  Since we won't let same sex partners marry they can't possibly get divorced.  Seems like, if anything, this is an argument for same sex adoption.  I'd argue that anything that gets children out of the foster system and out of orphanages and into a loving home is a positive step for the children.  "
1,"The only social experiment that we are doing that is undermining families in this country is economic. We have reduced wages in this country to the point that one person cannot support a household anymore leaving kids to fend for themselves or at daycare most of the time. We have increased class sizes to unmanageable levels because we can’t  afford (or don’t want to) to pay teachers and when we do notice problems with our children getting help is next to impossible unless you have thousands of dollars you can part with to pay for it.Most of us ignore reality thinking we know what a typical family looks like or is suppose to look like. We ignore what our children are really doing when they are out of our sight and refuse to take responsibility when they don’t turn out the way we think they should.  There is always someone or something else to blame, TV, video games, drugs, how about we blame ourselves for a change.Why is it that all of these arguments concerning gays, marriage, and parenthood are always waged by religious organizations? Why if there was any legitimacy at all to any of this we don’t have secular agreement. I respect the right of every individual to believe what they want but don’t state your superstition as fact."

1,"Within my varied circle of friends is a lesbian couple in their early 50s who have been together for 30 years. They live in inner-suburban Sydney, Australia, where pretty much, no-one cares about the gender(s) of a couple. They are happy, stable and affluent thanks to years of hard work and long, steady careers.They have a son who has just finished high school. One of his parents is his birth mother; the other is related through the sperm of the father.Their son is a handsome, good-natured, polite, clever and amiable boy with a bright future because in a free, open society like Australia, no church overwhelms the moral judgments of the population, and he is at no disadvantage.In the US the problem is not the gender of the couple; it is the society around them that disadvantages the children. Unfortunately this kind of issue is always a numbers thing. The law moves slowly behind society - but when does any law on a moral issue precede the need or want of the population? So there has to be a critical mass of people demanding legal recognition: the pioneers. These pioneers have managed very well to raise children despite the lack of societal and legal support in the US.It has always struck me as strange that a country who is so consumed by the supposed welfare of these children is only now beginning to look at a system of universal health care that many other developed countries (e.g. UK, Sweden, Australia, Canada, France) have had for decades. Certainly there would be more harm done to US children whose families are damaged or compromised by the burden of inferior public health care or unethical insurers than anything affecting children of gay couples. The US moral masses should get their priorities right.By the way, Australia has just formally identified dozens of ways in which our current laws disadvantage gay people. Right now, these are in the process of being rewritten. It's a wonderful thing for our society. I look forward to the day when everyone is equal at law and our community is comprised of many different types of people, all contributing their diversity to a rich and elevated way of living. In Australia, it will come. In the US... well, I can't see it happening any time soon."

1,"We teach our children the same things any parent teaches his or her children.  That seems rather obvious to me.  First they learn about their own bodies.  They ask questions and a parent answers those questions honestly, but at the level of detail appropriate to the age of the child.  Then they notice differences about the other gender (in our case, our daughters observed that the family dogs were built a little differently).  The parent again explains what the child has observed, at a level appropriate to the child's age and questions.There is nothing particularly difficult, here.  "
2,"You right, there is nothing difficult because you and the good doctor avoid the real issue. Describing the physical differences between a male and a female is not the issue. Its about two same sex adults not being capable of giving emotional and experience laden guidence to maturing children of the opposite sex.

And if an issue comes up in which input from a person of the opposite gender seems necessary or important, there are other family members and trusted friends to turn to for additional help and guidance.  To declare this as a reason why same-gender parents are inadequate to parent children is simply ridiculous.  It's equivalent to claiming that a black child cannot be adequately parented by white parents because they will not be able to give the child guidance with regard to his/her race.  Good, loving parents meet challenges as they come up and use the resources available to them to care for their children.  Prejudice is what puts children at a disadvantage, not loving parents."

1,"First of all, I have to say that I am highly insulted by your comment. To say that a mother cannot give her male child guidance (or father to daughter) is ludicrous and inflammatory. I have been a single parent to a son for most of his 16 years and he is very well-adjusted, well-informed and open-minded (if I do say so myself ; ) ).Secondly, while I have no studies to support my claim, I have lots of personal experience. I am raising my son with my same-sex partner, and as I've already stated, he is doing exceptionally well. I know several same-sex couples who have adopted and I can't think of one instance where these children are ""disadvantaged"". Can there be challenges in these circumstances? Of course. But what child doesn't provide a challenge to their parent(s) at some point.If anything, I would say that these adopted children are better off than many children. They were given to families who wanted them with all of their hearts, and who had to fight every step of the way to bring them home. Once there, they are showered with love and affection. The only thing that might make their lives easier would be if they were not stared at with contempt by the bigots of this country."
2,"My response didn't get thru so I'll try again. I really don't care if your insulted by the truth or not, that's your problem. How can you really think a female can give a male perspective? Thre are experiences in life that are sex oriented and no matter hom much you want it not to be, some things are impossible.Please explain how a male can possibly explain the mother instinct to a male adolescent? Please comment on the relationship a mother has with a son, if your a male?We are our experiences and nothing can change that.Please explaine ""well adjusted"" and ""open minded"". Is one inclusive of the other? Who says so, you? The neighbor?. The only thing same sex parenets cannot give a child is the same as an only parent.The emotional and experience of the opposite sexual parent. A family experienced of a father and mother.Your perspective that all's a child need is love and affection is rather limited in itself. Love an affection have nothing to do with the focus of discussion so why mention it?Most adopted kids want to know who their biological parents are. There is a bond that is undeniable and has nothing to do with the love and kindness of another.You talk about bigots like straights have a corner on the market. Waht about the gay's threatening the lives of christians? I suppsoe that's OK since they promote you agenda.

Is one inclusive of the other? Who says so, you? The neighbor? ""Yes, one is inclusive of the other. Who says so? I do. This is my forum, my opinions, so I decide.I agree that children of same sex parents or single parents lack a parent of one gender. I just don't believe that necessarily makes them ""disadvantaged"". There are other family members, friends, loved ones, etc. that a parent can turn to if the need arises. For myself, I can't think of a time when my gender hindered my parenting. But that's just me.""Your perspective that all's a child need is love and affection is rather limited in itself. Love an affection have nothing to do with the focus of discussion so why mention it?"" I certainly never stated that ALL a child needs is love and affection. Wouldn't that make this an easier world? I was simply using this as an example to illustrate that children with same-sex parents are not at a disadvantage. And I have to disagree that these things have ""nothing to do with the focus of this discussion"". I find as a parent, that things like love, affection, understanding, etc. help get us through a lot of life's rough parts. Don't you agree? These things are the foundation of ANY solid parent-child relationship. ""Most adopted kids want to know who their biological parents are. There is a bond that is undeniable and has nothing to do with the love and kindness of another."" I agree. Not sure of the relevance to this discussion, however. Seems like that is true whether the child was adapted my moms, dad, or one of each...""You talk about bigots like straights have a corner on the market.""I never said any such thing. Bigots come in all shapes, sizes, and sexualities. ""Waht about the gay's threatening the lives of christians? I suppsoe that's OK since they promote you agenda.""I haven't heard of any gay people threatening the lives of Christians. Can you please direct me to that news story? If it has happened, I would say it's NOT okay. When's the last time you say a protest sign that said ""God Hates Church-Goers"" or ""Kill all Baptists""??? I didn't think so. My only ""agenda"" is to live my life the best I can. ""Or pedophiles wanting to become parents haveing close access same sex children, schools, and friends. Or do you say that this doesn't exist?"" I'm not sure what your point is here. What does this have to do with bigotry? Of course pedophiles exist, and of course I don't agree with them.  "
1,"Equal Civil Rights are the most pressing issue.  NO gay-parented family in this nation has the same rights as a straight, married couple and their children.  Even those legally married in MA, CA or CT do not have any of the more than 1000 rights, protections and privileges granted by federal law to married couples.  But worse than this is the fact that many, many gay people live in one of the 30 states which do not have even the most basic of Civil Rights protections for gays, such as the right to not be fired from a job or refused employment because one is gay, or the right not to be denied the purchase or rental of a home because one is gay.  These Civil Rights (or the denial thereof) affect gay-parented families even more than they do gay individuals, because an individual might be presumed to be straight, but a couple with children become extremely obvious to prospective landlords, home sellers or real estate agents.  And employers are not in most places compelled to offer equal access to employer-paid health insurance to the spouses of gay employees.  And if they DO offer such benefits, it is generally not of much benefit, anyway, since gay couples have to pay income taxes on benefits paid for gay spouses as though they were part of the employee's taxable income, making such benefits often as costly or more costly than purchasing health insurance privately.  Since many gay parents cannot form a legal relationship to children adopted by or born to their spouse, they also cannot cover these children as dependents on their employer health insurance.  The children will not be eligible to receive Social Security payments if that parent dies.  And if the biological or adoptive parent dies, the children may lose both parents simultaneously, because they may be taken away from the remaining parent to be placed in foster care with strangers.  There are far too many ways in which gay-parented families are disadvantaged by being denied equal civil rights which are granted as a part of civil marriage to list them all here, or even a tiny fraction of them.  But suffice to say that THESE are the ways in which children of same-gender parents are disadvantaged as compared to children of opposite-gender parents -- not because their parents love them any less or cannot parent them as well as opposite-gender parents."
2,"Wow, those are some bold ""statistics"" you've presented.  Any chance you can link us to the documentation that shows the percentage of homosexuals amongst circumcised males, sexually abused children and lower class income people?  My first reaction is that is totally bogus information, so if you can back that up with some actually scientific research, that would be helpful.If I made some assumptions from what you've said, then most (over 50%?) of men in America must be homosexuals, because most males born in the US are circumsized.  One could also assume that blacks make up a large percentage of lower income families, so most blacks are homosexual.  So the odds of a black man being heterosexual in America, must be pretty slim!!  But then, as we recently saw in California, most blacks voted for prop 8, so I'm guessing most blacks aren't homosexual, and it's just my guess, but I'd think most American men are also heterosexual.There have been some scientific studies that are finding some evidence of genetic predisposition, but they are not conclusive either.  It wont surprise me a bit if in 10-20 years they've found more evidence.BUT I whole heartedly agree with your last paragraph, that you can't change a person's orientation once established."

1,"I second Ibauer42's request for scientific documentation of the claims you are making here, bagpiper2005.  The fact is that most molest victims do NOT become gay, nor do they have higher rates of homosexuality than those who were not molested.  Considering the statistics (last I heard, somwhere around 1 in 4 girls are molested (conservatively) prior to the age of 18 -- if someone has a more accurate estimate, please correct me), that would mean that young women would have astronomical rates of becoming lesbians.However, the fact is that only a small percentage of women identify as lesbian, and of those, many are neither victims of molestation, nor raised in ""lower class"" families.  Let alone circumcised. :rolleyes:Yeah, as a non-circumcised, non-molested lesbian raised in a typical middle-class family, I'd really like to see some SCIENTIFIC backup for your claims."

1,"Quibbling about the potential adjusted percentages doesn't change the fact that being molested does not make people gay.  If one wishes to scientifically that ""being molested makes you gay,"" it would be necessary to demonstrate scientifically that a significantly higher percentage of molest victims are gay than the general population.  Even demonstrating that a large number of gay people are molest victims (if that were the case) does not provide a causal link, as there may be other reasons why those people were were selected for victimization -- perhaps a predator saw them as particularly vulnerable due to their social isolation.  All of this is hypothetical, anyway.Any way you look at it we don't even have reliable statistics on child abuse (particularly sexual) to begin with, because its very nature causes it to be grossly underreported, both by children who are actively being molested and by adults who were molested in their past, let alone any studies demonstrating anything remotely approaching a ""causal link"" to the etiology of same-gender attraction.  This is just so much folklore trotted out time and time again until it has become an urban legend."

1,"Of course, ""sin"" is a word whose definition is subject to individual point of view. ""Sin"" is necessarily narrow-minded. What you or even most consider ""sin"" is no implication an individual does or MUST define it the same way or even use the term at all.I myself have no need of the concept of ""sin"". In my view, in light of fact and logic, in light of what I value and my own personal goals, a thing is either rational or irrational. If there were a ""sin"" in my view, it would be anything I think, feel, say or do that contradicts my own values and goals. What may or may not be a ""sin"" in my book in no way implies what it is or must be to another. There are no doubt values and goals you hold that I would judge as ""sinful"" in my view, however, my view is no more an imperative in your life than yours is in mine or the lives of others.Keep in mind the fact that ""society"", in general and as you seem to be using it, necessarily includes ALL views, not simply yours or those of the abstract ""majority"". ""Majority"" does not equate to ""society"" although every society indeed has a majority opinion that is continually changing. That I am a member of ""society"" in general means that society approves of all of my views, however, it also means that some members of that same ""society"" do not. That I am a member of ""society"" does not imply I am a member of ""majority"" but, being a member outside of the majority does not imply my viewpoint is incorrect or that of the majority necessarily correct. Might does not imply right, nor does right necessarily come with might. Being an abstract, ""society"" can neither approve nor disapprove of anything. Only individual members of society can do that. ""Society"" is simply a term to refer to all individuals who consider themselves members of it. No doubt, my views exclude me from your definition of ""society"", however, your views exclude you from mine and from the definition by others of the same. You must always keep in mind that, although you are a member of a group, you may or may not have the justification to speak for the group as a whole. Because you believe a thing to be a ""sin"" or because the majority of a group believe a thing to be a sin does not imply the entire group believes it to be a sin or must."
1,"I love your statement: ""You (among all atheists) might be moral -- for now, but if you don't believe in God and the Bible, we cannot hold you to it.""What you're admitting is that a religious person, like yourself, who believes in heaven and hell behaves morally for mostly selfish reasons -- to buy admission to heaven and to avoid hell. You can't understand that anyone would choose to live a life of kindness, compassion, and love of fellow human beings for unselfish reasons, so you don't trust atheists who appear to live a moral life.I'm not saying that religious folks can't be unselfishly moral sometimes, but they ought to question their motives constantly, because their morality is so inextricably intertwined with a selfish desire to please the big guy up there and thereby buy admission to the big prize. Only the atheist can be moral in simple, uncomplicated way."
1,"...but not Christianity.  Religion tries to earn acceptance from God by being ""good,"" which is impossible for us.  I'll try to explain in this limited format...  Christians   believe that accepting Jesus Christ as God's Son and the forgiveness of their sin by grace (which is free to us, not earned - Jesus Christ died for us because he didn't want us to die for eternity, which is the inevitable consequence of sin) is what enables them to go to heaven.  What we do with grace only proves whether or not we understand and value it.  We will sin at times.  We are not perfect in this life, but we are forgiven, and because we are grateful for that, and with the power that realization gives us, we can choose to   change   how we act and treat others.  Christians acknowledge the damaging effects of sin in our lives and in   society  .  Pretending that each person has the wisdom and rational/impartial judgment to decide what is right and wrong based on their own opinions of their behavior doesn't make sense.  In other words, we would obviously have a strong bias in our own favor.  We believe the definition of sin was put in place by God through the Bible in part to illustrate that we are actually incapable of living up to any real code of conduct on our own because we naturally want sin, and need God in our lives to change those desires.  We are all born with sinful desires but also a desire to be good... but God made a way for us to acknowledge the sinful desires (includes envy, greed, gossip, hate, homosexuality, drunkenness, lying, selfishness, pride, etc.), ask God for forgiveness (because our sin is rebellion to his authority over his creation - us), and commit to changing by the power of Jesus' grace and love.  Jesus' example was to love everyone, and that's my personal standard.  Sometimes I fall short, but Jesus is helping me to do better.  Just because you love someone doesn't mean you have to tell them they are perfect, or that everything they do is good.  Acknowledging sin leads us to the only one who can help, and that is its own reward.  Recognizing sin isn't about judging, it's about offering hope.Not everyone will choose to believe this, but God gave us choice.  If he just forced everyone to do what He wanted there would be no value in our compliance.  I obey because He loves me and I love Him.  Unlike us, he is perfection, but loves us enough to forgive our imperfections. My answer should have been ""SOMETIMES."" We are all born with desires to do things that are wrong (sin), and that could include homosexual desires, but God loves us anyhow and sacrificed everything to make it possible for us to change."
1,"In response to my assertion that only an atheist can be truly moral because religious folks have mixed motives -- they also want to earn a ticket to heaven -- you claim that   Christians   are different from other religious types because they know they can't get to heaven by being ""good."" Instead, you say, ""Christians believe that accepting Jesus Christ as God's Son and the forgiveness of their sin by grace ... is what enables them to go to heaven."" OK, so you spell out a particular way to earn that ticket. But surely you don't think you could live a life of total evil and massive cruelty and still get a Go-To-Heaven-Free card just by ""accepting Jesus Christ as God's Son and the forgiveness of [your] sin by grace."" I'm sure you'd present some weasel words to say that you can't really do the former and the latter at the same time, but it isn't the behavior that impresses God, it's the accepting part. OK, whatever. You can still impress him favorably or unfavorably, right, and that may influence where he sends you after death.But how about taking a quick test to check the purity of your motives. Imagine that God came to you and explained that he didn't supervise the writing of the Bible and it has some errors. Most importantly, there really is no Heaven or Hell, or indeed any afterlife for humans. When you die, you're dead. Period. And there's no resurrection except for Jesus. Furthermore, he doesn't reward or punish people in this world, either. He leaves that responsibility to other people and their societies. In short, there is no devine reward or punishment at all. You live your life and then you die, and if you want to worship   god   and obey his instructions, that's your choice (free will), but there's no benefit to you. He doesn't even keep track of who does and who doesn't.Furthermore, he points out that, contrary to your statement, he's never sacrificed anything for humans, because he always has everything he could ever want, and anything he does for us is no skin off his nose. He isn't even capable of sacrifice. Even seeing his so-called son on the cross didn't cause him any displeasure. He's not human, after all, and cannot suffer. It's not possible. And he can't be pleased, either. He's already perfect. He is not humanoid, as many people like to imagine.Given that information, can you honestly say that you would continue to worship him as devoutly as before, knowing that you will get absolutely nothing in return? If you can, then I will award you a special Purity of Motives award. But I think those awards will be quite rare, indeed."
1,"But that doesn't necessarily make the motives of those involved selfish.As I said, I'm motivated by my love for God.  I love Him because of who He is... that He is a loving Creator that cares about His creation and WAS willing to sacrifice for us (along with many other things about Him too numerous to detail here).  If he were just a careless deity that made people then left them with no clue as to who he was, and didn't care what they did, and wasn't interested in helping them, he would NOT be the God I love. Loving Him naturally causes me to take stock of what I do.  It's no different with any close relationship.  For instance... my husband could tell me that he loves me and will love me no matter what I do or don't do. Let's say upon hearing this I take his unconditional love and flaunt it by bringing home a different man every night to sleep in our bed, or I beat our   children  , or any other offensive act.  Barring I stop doing these things and ask for forgiveness, the relationship would be lost.  He could still love me, but I just proved that I didn't love him.  This is true with God, too.  He won't force us to be in a relationship with Him if we don't want to.  I can't convince you that I'm being truthful (but I am).  That's where faith would have to come into play.  You can choose to stay cynical, or you can trust a person who you don't know.  I understand if you choose the former.  But I do hope you meet others like me ...or maybe you already have and haven't trusted their words either?  It's your choice.  From my experience, I sincerely hope you choose to trust God - not for any special ""reward"" He'll give you, but because of His grace and love for you.  I don't expect any particular reward or lack of reward either way.  If I have a reward, it's now, and will be after death, simply to be with the One who is the definition of love.  Nothing you or anyone else does or doesn't do will   change   that."

1,"If genetics is not a major factor in causing homosexuality, then it must not be a major factor in causing heterosexuality, either. The fact that most people and other sexually reproducing animals are attracted to the opposite sex must be just the result of upbringing or happenstance, not genetics. But of course we know that's not true. We fully accept that genetics control the sexual preference of heterosexuals, and that natural selection, for those who don't deny its existence, is the mechanism for the genetic predominance of heterosexuality. So if we accept that straight people are born straight because of their genes, why do so many refuse to acknowledge that gays can be born gay because of their genes? Let's be consistent.But then the question arises: How would   evolution   tolerate the continued existence of one or more gay genes, since gays seldom reproduce? I think the answer is that there is not a ""gay"" gene or genes and a ""straight"" gene or genes, but many genes that contribute to a sexual preference for males or for females, not for ""same sex"" or for ""other sex."" Usually, males get mostly the ""prefer females"" genes and females get mostly ""prefer males"" genes, but sometimes, due to chromosome crossovers, perhaps, some individuals get mostly the ""wrong"" genes for their sex. I mean ""wrong"" not in any moral sense, but only in the sense that the individual usually doesn't produce offspring and therefore tends to be a ""dead end"" from the standpoint of natural selection. Nevertheless, the ""prefer male"" and ""prefer female"" genes themselves continue to thrive as essential to reproduction, and ocassional crossovers continue to occur because they have many other evolutionary advantages.So while some gays may object to being considered an evolutionary dead end, it's obvious that they do tend to reproduce less frequently than straights. But all that has no relevance to their rights as human beings and as citizens. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being gay, there is probably no way to change it unless the individual's genetic predisposition is very weak, and why would anyone want to change gays to straights unless there is some compelling need to increase population growth? Since we tend to have an overpopulation problem, gays are probably better for society than straights. We need to abandon the notion that there is something deficient or morally wrong about being gay, or having dark skin, or being ""just"" a female. Get over it."
2,I do not believe that babies are born gay.  However when they grow up or during they tend to turn the other way.  More interested in their own kind than the opposite females or otherwise. I am from the west--and my wife is from San Francisco California--where there are a lot of gay people.  I was a little stunned at first--but got over that--as I have met gay people on both sides.  They all are pretty nice people. So if they are happy with the set up--I have no problem with that. People tend to be judge mental mostly because the gay people are different than regular people.  So let them be and let them be happy--like we are hopfully.
1,"Of course, preference for homosexual relationships has a genetic origin just as any other sort of sexual behavior, however, genetic predisposition for certain behaviors does not imply one will or ought to act on that predisposition. Genetics simply sets the parameters of a life, it does not dictate which choices one will make in behavior within those parameters. Genetics establishes the available choices. It is up to you to actually make the choice. There is no doubt, although a heterosexual prefers the opposite gender as a sexual partner, they are at least capable of choosing differently. Homosexuality, bisexuality or asexuality are options open to them. All that limits their choices is their thinking and emotions and, of course context. So too the homosexual or the asexual. Although the homosexual prefers the same sex or the asexual no sex at all, the first can conceivably choose sexual relations with a different gender given a different frame of mind and a different context and the asexual could conceivably choose to have sex given those same conditions. Genetics originates the preference and specific available choices but it does not dictate the specific behaviors within one's power to choose among alternatives. No one is necessarily  constrained by preference unless they choose to be which, if you think about it, isn't constraint at all. Genetically-rooted preference for sex with the same gender or the opposite gender or something else entirely isn't a collar around anyone's neck, however, the genetic need to consume fuel and fluid and air to continue living is a leg iron locked to us all.None of this is to say, as many critics of homosexuality, asexuality, bisexuality or any other type of sexual behavior OTHER than heterosexuality are want to do, that because one CAN choose a heterosexual lifestyle that one MUST choose it. That a predisposition toward homosexuality still allows freedom to choose a different lifestyle isn't criticism against homosexuality any more than freedom of choice in one's heterosexuality is criticism of that lifestyle. Heterosexuals can choose homosexual or bisexual or asexual behavior even if they usually don't and believe they never will. One cannot claim the ability to predict all future choices given the truth that no one can predict all the future contexts in which one will find oneself. No, that one can choose which preferences one expresses through behavior isn't automatic criticism of any particular choice in the set of alternatives.Many among critics of homosexuality claim the lifestyle to be ""unnatural"" which is nonsensical because, by definition, anything one can do is necessarily natural. One cannot do something that is ""outside of nature"" because there is no ""outside"". All that we have done, do or will do is natural and cannot be otherwise. Second, these persons also point out that homosexuality is non-reproductive and therefore a threat to the survival of the species. This could only be true if ""survival of the species"" were a duty on the head of every individual. It clearly is not. ""Species"" is an abstract concept. It is not something that exists in and of itself. It is merely a way of speaking of all human individuals as a set. That there IS a human species in no way implies there MUST be a human species and therefore each individual human being has the duty to reproduce. Reproduction and the reason why one chooses to reproduce are always individual and relative to one's own life. There is no inescapable necessity to make children. Certainly, if the human species comes to an end it would be a tragedy for human beings but we can be quite satisfied nature and life on Earth will continue with or without human beings. Human beings are certainly an element of nature but cannot claim to be an essential element of nature. Sexual behavior CAN be reproductive but there is no implication it MUST be reproductive and certainly no implication it must ALWAYS be reproductive. Even most heterosexuals enjoy non-reproductive sex. All in all, if all human sexual behavior were necessarily reproductive, the Earth would swiftly become overrun by human beings OR human beings would severely limit their sexual behavior to limit the creation of more like them for practical reasons - not religious ones. Of course, there is much reason to insist that human beings restrict reproduction for practical reasons already. In light of those quite obvious practical concerns, one would expect human cultures to embrace non-reproductive and non-heterosexual sex rather than continually criticizing them. But, perhaps, the criticism of non-reproductive sex is merely the noise of the squeakiest wheels on the cart rather than the opinion of the majority."

2,"I agree with the cold distant reasoning you have.  However, we have to realize that sex acts are not separate from some of societies ills.  You can argue that is where laws and   religion   come in, which you are right.  However, if one claims that sex has no consequences/results that is being unrealistic. One (I believe) reason for the concern of   homosexuality   is the results or the symptoms of society and what does that tell us of that societies path.  You did mention that earth will happily turn around and around the sun without humans.  It is the same as a person thinking about suicide and realizing that life still goes on without that person.  On a personal human level-that is very unsatisfactory.  Which leads us to another thought ""Value of human life or life in general"", which can lead to the concepts of human rights and equal rights.  In the big scheme of things (big picture) if there is no real value transcendent beyond the chemical make up of humans then what you say is true and fine.  However, societies believe different....wars...inventions...prolonging life...civil rights...Striving to live and beyond that the value of human life.    I appreciate your calmness. "

Instead, you and many others, immediately resort to religious bigotry (which implicitly concedes that there really is no substance to the innate immutable myth afterall).

1,"to often persons attempt to consider procreation as the only reasonable assertion to prove that homosexuality is genetically a ""dead end"".  to make your investigation on this topic quick and easy, read last months Scientific American, that issue was completely devoted to the topic of   evolution  .  you will find a broad group of disscussions which cover topics of the multiple ways that genetics of a species are fortified for continuation....not all being limited to mere procreation.  for one, there is the success of the population being aided by ""unselfish"" genes....these are traits held by individuals of a group that tend to make the group in which they live survive better than those without them.  studies (they are cited here....do your homework yourself) show that even though individuals have a trait not shared by all which can save the group, those populations which gave rise to them not only just survive, but tend to create larger numbers of those with the ""unselfish"" genes in there future populations, beyond those created by those who have already expressed the gene.many species survive as a result of the variable genetics of it's population at a given time.  one could quite easily say (merely as conjecture) that gay persons assist the community without the ""expense"" of having added another mouth to feed to compete for resources.  Since there has been nearly no protracted period in our evolutionary history where resources have NOT been often strained, this little example alone is enough to give substantial reason for gay persons to exist.  A gay person would work, be able to share in the groups defense, could kill more bison or harvest more grain than he or she would consume and thus assist in the survival of the group.  here...any group which created gay persons would perhaps out survive one where there were none or....to be fair one where the entire population was gay (a certain and only example of a genetic ""dead end"").in addition, regarding the gay vrs. straight ratio;  there are thousands of papers which have been written that put the population of persons that are born slightly to severely hermaphodidic at about 11%.  the now defunct magazine THE SCIENCES by the New York Academy of Science had a very major article which disscussed that before the surgical technology to ""correct"" elements of hermaphadism in children existed, this population had to be counciled as to how to get through our society.  the regularity of this was well documented and was readily a part of psychiatric training. the narrow man/woman catagories we often argue about are just a portion of the human reality.It is only in the human mind that ""this"" or ""that"" exists.  nature attempts and continually demonstrates that nearly everything is on the table at all times.  and it is in the fact that the ratio of homosexual to heterosexual is pretty much a heterogeneous ratio across all societies (when verified to account for societal suppression of admition of homosexuality) that shows that it is a genetic creation, and one that the species has found to be of bennifit eons before culture existed as we now experience it."
2,"Paul R. Ehrlich, Bing Professor of Population Studies at Stanford and evolutionists, president of the Center for Conservation Biology and a past president of the AIBS, said the Human Genome Project had ``put the final nail in the coffin of genetic determinism.He goes on to say ""Evolutionary psychology`` - the discipline that attempts to explain much of human behavior as a creation of natural selection that operated during our hunter-gatherer past - ``is dead but doesn`t seem to know it yet,`` told the annual meeting of the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) in Arlington, Va. ""For instance, there is no reason to believe that human beings are either innately violent or innately peaceful, instinctively disposed to wreck their environments or to be conservationists, or born genetically gay or genetically straight.""I'm sure there's going to be those people who don't let the facts get in the way of their opinion."
1,"the area of evolutionary psychology has within itself those who believe that   evolution   has stopped more or less and that all our behavioral structures were created in ancient history.  these persons are regarded by the reaches of their logic as POP EPers.  the popularized elements of EP tend to lack credibility due to their overaching claims, but when one considers the grand questions that the field at large still considers unanswered one sees that the field is still alive as it has not by even its own admition remotely solved many of the questions which lay open.  perhaps this was a rubutal by Ehrlich against the over reaching conclusions of just some in this arena of investigation."
2,"I am a college male who was born with a high voice. Over the course of my life people have mistaken me for a girl and sadly that took a toll on me and when I entered high school I was unsure as to what my sexuality was. Since I had straight Christian family, I should not have ended up being bisexual. However in the end that is what I am. I NEVER wanted to be this. I am a firm upstanding example of how there was no genetics involved or a choice. I have an attraction that I am not proud of but it isn't something I am able to be cured from. I can choose to resist the temptations of that lifestyle but I will always be bisexual. Rarely do you have an obvious example set in front of you like this but keep it in mind when you say that it is a genetic trait or it is a choice."
2,"OK so let me ask this. How is it possible that there can be so many random cases of homo and bisexuality can be supposedly genetic when there has been no clear findings as to the gene or chemicals (as you talked about)? Also how is it that until this point in my families history there have been no other bi or homosexual males? Your telling me that my family (traced back to 1620) NEVER had this ""recessive"" or ""chemical imbalance"" before? What are the odds of that?!! Seriously if we can't predict the odds of homosexuality occurring, prove the genetic trait that causes it, or find the chemical imbalance then what makes you/or others think that it really exists? Really? You have to come up with a better rebuttal than that!"
2,"Logical minds think in a specific way. If something can be proven by facts then it exists. In this case there are NO facts to show that homosexuality is a genetic or chemical. Therefore it isn't a possibility for me to be making an ""entire arguement based off of ignorance"" since there are no facts to back up that assumption. I will happily buy into that logic or even give it a chance if there was ANY indication that it could exist. However there has been nothing but ""possibilities"" and theories in that line of thought.So how is information based on theories and possibilities any more IGNORANT than my claim? Really you have to do better than that! You need more than just a strong opinion to debate a topic like this!!"
1,"Chezdude1, you ask how your bisexuality could be genetically caused since ""until this point in my family's history there have been no other bi or homosexual males?"" I answered this in an earlier comment on this series. There is no need to suppose that gay genes or straight genes exists -- but rather that some genes predispose a person to a sexual attraction toward females and others toward males. Usually, males get mostly ""lust for female"" genes and females get mostly ""lust for male"" genes, but sometimes, due to chromosome crossovers or other events during the genetic shuffle in the formation of a sperm, a male (Y) sperm may get mostly ""lust for male"" genes or a female (X) sperm mostly ""lust for female"" genes. Then his or her gay predisposition is genetically determined even though therie is no such thing as a gay gene and no family history of   homosexuality  ."

When one is socialized into a heterosexual   society  , the experience of understanding that there is also a gay society is often not even realized until one sees that there are others like oneself. I wouldn't necessarily call that being influenced, but having one's eye's open to something that already exists."

We are all born as human beings and our lives are the keys to understanding what makes a person enjoy the features of the same sex.Maybe a boy was molested by a woman and grows up fearing them and only accepting the comfort of other men.  Maybe a girl has a bad experience with dating boys and likes the comfort of women.  Maybe the   media   we grow up with is a greater factor in whether a child grows to like their own sex as opposed to the ""natural"" liking of the opposite sex.  It could be that   homosexuality   first arose from the will to go against social rule or perhaps it had to do more with convenience.In any case, there is no evidence that when a baby is born it will prefer one sex over another.  Just because a child learns ""mom"" first doesn't mean it will prefer the features of a woman (physical and emotional).Is being gay wrong or immoral?  Hell no, it's a perfectly acceptable choice because there is no force in the universe that can prove that is is wrong.  Have i issued any facts in this comment?  No, but I feel that common sense should be a prevailing factor in an issue that can not and has not been scientifically supported (sorry religious people).This all being said, I am a straight man with gay friends."

Homosexuality was UNHEARD OF. We starting seeing this new fad on our public television shows. The Oprah Show promoted the   homosexuality   show's so much that I got sick of watching and hearing this. Her show was the FIRST to PROMOTE the FIRST PREGNATE MAN. Of course the man WAS a woman. Television shows influnce weak minds. Marriages started breaking up. Fifty years ago DIVORCE was not heard of. I knew no one who was divorced---then the television talk shows started talking about it is better to break up than stay together. Now the divorce rate has gone sky high. Compare the rate from the 1950's till now.Fifty years ago an unmarried teenage pregnate girl was unheard of. None of my friends had a baby out of wedlock. No one in my school was pregnate either. Today the schools are filled with young girls flaunting their   pregnancy  . Now they proudly walk the streets unmarried and unashamed.

Research the history of homosexuality population. Research how many homosexual people did our country have in the 50's-60's-70's till now.

2,"Here are a few quotes from article about APA announcement:'Gay' gene claim suddenly vanishes as American Psychological Association revises statement on   homosexuality  .At one of the main presentations several eminent researchers, including Dr. Dean Byrd and Dr. Joseph Nicholosi, challenged the APA's positions which promote homosexuality as normal and strongly discourage research into reparative types of therapy. These positions were politically charged with no basis in medical   science  , they claimed. Particularly, the ""gay gene"" theory has no basis in scientific fact. The APA top officials who were there seemed a bit shocked that this would be confronted so publicly, and promised to look into it. It appears that some wheels started turning.Yesterday the following article appeared in WorldNetDaily:Gay' gene claim suddenly vanishesAmerican Psychological Association revises statement on homosexualityMay 12, 2009By Bob Unruh, WorldNetDaily.comA publication from the American Psychological Association includes an admission that there is no ""gay"" gene, according to a doctor who has written about the issue on the website of National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality. A. Dean Byrd, the past president of NARTH, confirmed that the statement from the American Psychological Association came in a brochure that updates what the APA has advocated for years... However, in the update: a brochure now called, ""Answers to Your Questions for a Better Understanding of Sexual Orientation & Homosexuality,"" the APA's position changed. The new statement says: ""There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles. ...""""Although there is no mention of the research that influenced this new position statement, it is clear that efforts to 'prove' that homosexuality is simply a biological fait accompli have failed,"" Byrd wrote. ""The activist researchers themselves have reluctantly reached that conclusion. There is no gay gene. There is no simple biological pathway to homosexuality."" ..The ""Berlin Wall"" of propaganda may be close to coming down!

1,"I don't remember ever choosing to be gay. As long as I can remember, even when I was around ten years old, I had emotional feelings for boys my age that I did not feel toward girls. I liked girls then, and I like women now, but my emotional feelings are different toward women than toward men, and my sexual feelings toward women are nonexistent.If I had been given a choice I most likely would have chosen to be in the majority, where I would find a larger pool of mates and a greater number of people to whom I'd feel connected. I've had a successful life as a brown-eyed gay man, though, and I see as much need to change my sexuality as my eye color. In this world people are not all the same height and weight, and do not all have the same hair color and hair texture. Sexuality is merely one more characteristic that adds to our individuality.While it's true that Hitler and some others throughout history have viewed inborn characteristics as a measure of a person's worthiness of life, none of those other characteristics are questioned today, at least in polite   society  .

So if the argument is ""I was born that way"" works for the Gay Community then it works for Serial Killers, Pedophiles and Rapists.Just as I believe Serial Killers, Pedophiles and Rapists are not born that way, I also believe people are not born Gay. The two driving factors are   environment   and choice."

Sep 23, 2005 - ""[regulations have had to be created that are aimed] at preventing Reservists and National Guard members from using their sexual orientation — or from pretending to be gay — to escape combat. 'The bottom line is some people are using sexual orientation to avoid deployment,' [civilian spokeswomen for the U.S. Army Forces Command Kim] Waldron said. 'So in this case, with the Reserve and Guard forces, if a soldier ‘tells,’ they still have to go to war and the homosexual issue is postponed until they return to the U.S. and the unit is demobilized.'"" While regulations have been created to combat this use of ""don't ask don't tell"" to avoid combat, getting rid of ""don't ask don't tell"" would eliminate this perverse use of the policy and the need for any such regulations.

2,"I am not aware of any persuasive or convincing Scientific research or studies that conclude that   homosexuality   is inherited through our genetic lineage. We can not say with any significant degree of certainty that homosexuality is inherited from our parents like hair color, eye color or facial features.  Having our sexual and/or romantic needs met by a person of the same sex or different sex is a choice that we make. All of us either choose homosexualtiy or heterosexuality as our sexaul preference.

1,"What difference does it make whether people are ""born gay"" or not?  If that's the question you want to ask, why don't we also ask whether people are ""born believing in Christianity"" and whether ""belief in Christianity can be overcome or even cured""?  We could eliminate all this hand-wringing about   homosexuality   if the right wing Christians would simply abandon their wicked ways and convert to a more reasonable   religion  .  But they don't want to, do they?The simple fact is that most gay men and women are happy the way they are and don't want to change.  Whether it's a choice or whether they can change really doesn't matter.  The primary reason gay men and women were ever unhappy is because right wing groups and extreme Christians made their lives miserable.So, who needs to change is not gays and lesbians, it is Christians.  And they definitely can change."
1,"I believe that we are making a mistake to dismiss the relationship between   homosexuality   in humans and sexual orientation among   animals  .  Man is classified as a member of the animal kingdom, and despite the fact the we are Spiritual creatures as well, we share common characteristics with the animal kingdom.  As I had mentioned elsewhere, I consider myself to be a Spiritual believer in the Heavenly Father and His Son.  Before the creation of Adam and Eve, Satan brought into the mortal Universe sin, which corrupted much of what God had intended for this world.  Adam and Eve agreed to commit themselves to sin, after being tempted and led into by Satan.  As a result, their offspring and all generations of human beings after them would be stained by the results of their actions.  From a Christian standpoint, this would include the genetic alteration of sexual orientation itself, which affected both people and animals.  To say that it is wrong for us to align the sexual orientations of people and animals is to ignore the reality of evil and its ability to originate from the soul.  Scripture tells us that humans are basically ""born of sin,"" which means that once our innocence in infancy has passed, our natural desires gain hold, and sin takes control.  As a result, animals and humans have been altered by the decisions that Adam and Eve had chosen in the Garden.  And that includes our gene pool, which determines our sexuality before birth.  More often than not, this is not a choice.  This is indeed something determined before birth because of sin, which came into the world before Adam was formed.  My apologies to the many decent   law  -abiding gay and lesbian people reading this: It is not a sin to be homosexual, and I have the highest respect for all people.  Thanks for sharing."

Why would anybody want to chose to be gay! We are openly discriminated, are treated as 2nd class citizens in this country and can't legally be married in most states.  I would have loved to be straight and had a loving wife and family and be treated with respect and enjoy all the rights and priviledges in this country.  I had to finally accept in my early 30's, that I am gay and that in I had to accept that reality!  The American Psychiatric Associationa and the American Medical Association have come out strongly for   gay rights   and believe there is nothing inherently wrong in being gay. I am also blessed that my family have always been accepting of my sexual orienta-tion as well as my   church  -the Episcopal Church.  "

2,"Personally, I do not believe a person is ""born gay"".  I do think early childhood experiences and   environment   influence sexual orientation.  I could be completely wrong and a person may be born as homosexual as Liberace.  I think the real question should be “Is   homosexuality   morally wrong?”    I, as a Christian, believe that it is a sin because the Bible says so.  However, nobody is guilt free as far as sin goes (with the exception of Jesus), we all have our faults.  Regardless if you are born homosexual or it’s a learned trait, I think you should try to overcome it, just as someone with overactive hormones should still be faithful to their spouse.  With that said, I don’t think any of us are any less guilty than the other in God’s eyes, as we all depend on the sacrifice of Jesus to make us clean.  God loves us all, and we should do our best to live by his laws, as this life is short and we all have our trials to overcome."
1,"Science shows that it's incredibly unlikely that people choose their orientation, and that it's really, really likely that there is a pretty strong biological component to sexual orientation. HISTORY shows us that same-sex relationships were fairly normal for most of the time humans have been on this earth. Biology shows that   homosexuality   shows up in most species studied. But regardless of that.Making a sexual orientation a moral issue, if sexual orientation is biological, is a bit like making anything else biological a moral issue--Race (that's something that's been done for a long, long time), or height, or what have you.

It was called the way of ""Shudo"", or youth. But it also showed up quite a bit--In monasteries, especially, where heterosexual acts were forbidden or simply impossible. Male   prostitution   was incredibly common throughout Japan's history. All of these things were written about by Jesuits--If they're something that Priests are being shown, they have to be somewhat normal.Europe: From Greece till the 18th century,   homosexuality   was an incredibly common occurence. Greece I feel like I don't even need to discuss. Every emperor of Rome with the exception of Claudius took a male lover at some point. This kept up until Theodosius, in 390, made it illegal to play the receptive part, and Justinian, in 558, did the same with the active part. So, for the majority of the Roman empire, homosexuality was accepted and common. In fact, for a lot of the Greek and Roman histories, same-sex love was the epitome of what we would term as romantic or meaningful love. Heterosexual love was what you did for   children  . The poets, from Plato and Aristotle to Sappho, spoke at length about that idea. And it makes sense. Familiarity breeds affection, and these were incredibly gender-segregated societies. Women were consigned to the home--Although this meant they really ran a farm rather than dusted--while men were either at war for a decade and a half, or in town doing the   politics   of the day.Throughout the renaissance, it was once again quite common with such public figures as Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and several more artists openly taking male lovers. It wasn't simply the art community. King James I was discussed at the time as being homosexual in a sort of joking context. Anything questions?"

2,When was never a question for me i've always liked women and that is the stupidiest question ever ask. 
1,they chose to be gay?
2,well let's see it is suppose to be man and women not man and man or women and women it has been taught to ever human from the beginning of time as far back as Moses or cavemen whichever your beleif is.Why do you think it was considered to be a taboo for it was so people would ask dum question! 
1,"of a guy who chooses MuffMonster as a screen name is somewhat questionable, but I'll table that for now.You're saying that heterosexuality needs to be taught? You were taught to be heterosexual?Actually,   homosexuality   has been around for pretty much ever. Plato taught it as the superior form of love. It's been a human norm for most of human history, and only became taboo in the last few centuries. Homosexuality appears in   animals  . It's a naturally occuring, biologically-caused event, just like heterosexuality."

2,"I'm not going to bash the question, because it's an interesting one. However, the question of ""is someone born gay"" deserves a ""no"" response because in my opinion, nobody can be born gay because that makes it seem like being gay is genetic which I don't think is true. It's a way of life that someone chooses by influences like people in their lives, cultural icons, personal decision, and quite possibly a psychological issue(s).The way of life has gay people ""down there"" and straight as ""up there"". In other words, it's taboo to be gay in some people's point of view. Religious   bible   thumpers say it goes against everything in the Good Book that   marriage   is a sacred unity between a man and a woman. Whatever the case may be, the person already in ""confusion"" about him/herself will only be feeling more confused. The influence of a celebrity, person in their life, or another icon will make them feel like ""Yeah... I can be just like them. Free."" This is a matter of choice.Another way someone may become gay is by personal decision. Following up on influences, someone may just decide for themselves because they may think it's best for them. The person may just have no desire for females or males, but may have desire for those of their own gender. Of course, if the person is a total worshipper of celebrities and outside influences, this is a decision made on their own.One last way a person may become gay is because he/ she might have a psychological problem. I know this paragraph will spark controversy, but I do believe this is a way that someone might become gay. The child growing up might not have had much of a male/ female influence around them growing up, and they may have ""turned"" at an early age because of it. And yes when I say ""turned"" I say that they swayed sexually. I do believe that too much male influence on a female side at a young age, can program the girls' brain into being more ""male-oriented"" in result making her a lesbian and making her attracted to other gay females. And vice versa on the male side making him ""gay"" attracted to other gay males. The thinking that someone is born gay isn't preposterous, but just not correct in my opinion. If being gay was in fact genetic, I'm pretty sure that discovery would have been discovered by now. I lean towards no because I strongly believe it is a personal decision made by the person to become gay."
1,"I'm judging from your picture that you're pretty young. When arguing a particular point, it's all fine and good to say something is your opinion. That's fine, you can have opinions. The problem is when those opinions fly in the face of facts, evidence, and expert testimony.You've been exposed to as much ""gay"" influence as your peers. What makes some gay and some straight? We're all inundated in the same cultural soup--why is it affecting us randomly, if not for the random facts of our biology.You're confusing biological with genetic. Not all things biological are related to one's genetic code. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, for example, has real, physical affects that aren't related to the genes of the person carrying it. The evidence studied indicates several factors that tie sexual orientation with biological characteristics. Birth order, for one--Women who give birth multiple times have lower levels of certain hormones in their womb by baby number 3 or 4. That's why, and this has been studied and confirmed, the more older siblings you have when you're born, the more likely it is that you'll end up a homosexual--at least, for men.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation   is a good list of all the studies that have been done regarding the biological factors in sexual orientation.As for it being a choice--certainly, we choose what we do with our genitals in most circumstances. However, we don't really get to choose what sets us off--what sort of person gets our motor running. Historically of course,   homosexuality   was a very, very different thing than it is today. But trust me when I say that it's been around forever--not just since celebrity culture has come about, it's seen in most   animals   studied--not just humans, and for most of human history it's been a societal norm--not an act of deviance, but something most everyone did at one point or another.

1,Did you choose your sex when you were born? Sexuality and gender identity are not choices any more than being left-handed or having brown eyes or being heterosexual are choices. They are a part of who you are. The choice is in deciding how to live your life.
1,"I realize that personal experience needs to be questioned, but my experiences tell me that sexual orientation is not a matter of choice.  I have known I was gay since I was 18 and if I am being truthful there were hints much, much earlier in my life that I ignored, because I didn't want to accept that reality.  When I discovered my gay identity, I became extremely closeted and spent several years in a quasi-suicidal mindset.  Had I been able to   change   my sexual orientation, I would have in a heartbeat.I don't know whether people are born gay or they ""become"" gay early in life.  I don't believe that it matters.  If there were a definite genetic link, the next stage would be for people to find a ""cure"" and honestly I don't believe I have anything to be cured of.  We should accept that sexuality is a complex part of human existence.  Some people are gay, some people are straight, some people are bisexual and others fall somewhere else on the spectrum.  And you know what, that's OK."
1,"Yes, of course. They choose to go against any ridiculous moral attitude by risking their lives (or only their friends, or their   jobs  ). For hundreds, if not thousands of years, they were discriminated against in many societies, they were punished, tortured, burned, killed just for loving somebody of the same sex. And why did they love someone of the same sex? Because they love the risk. They are real risk hunters, and they dream about to die, or at least to be beaten up or punished.

(1) Sexuality as it pertains to reproduction(2) Sexuality as it pertains to gender(3) Sexuality as it pertains to attractionBut none of this matters, in order to have an argument you must have evidence, I guess you just admitted you did not pose an argument.  I'm sorry to have bothered you.  "
1,"You seem to forget that gays are not raised by other gays.  Most gay people grow up in a surrounding family and social structure made up primarily of straight individuals.  They are, like other children, rewarded for exhibiting ""gender-appropriate"" behaviors and conforming to expected norms for the majority-straight population with which they are surrounding.  Societal conformity would tend to make gay people straight, not the other way around.And yet, the majority of gay people report having been ""different"" from their earliest memories.  While some certainly conformed to gender norms, many, many did not.  Why do you think so many of us faced tremendous teasing and harassment from our peers?  Certainly not because we were ""conforming"" to the social group with which we were surrounded.  "

1,"Hmmmm, I did go read the article you put in your posting and still left going ""huh?"" Really I could see no real link that you were attempting to establish regarding gay people. Actually, this would give some credence to the fact that DESPITE the ""norms"" influence gay people remain gay. We may hide a little more, due to the uncertainty of those that are different from us. Not shame mind you, but uncertainty as many have been on the receiving end of violence, predjudice and judgements. Safety and survival a human instinct we all have.I was born to straight parents, Christians, 7 kids and in SOUTH DAKOTA, definetly not my surroundings that influenced my sexuality. Although I guess on some level it was correct. I did try to hide, fake it and be ""normal"" and as a result suffered and made myself a victim. No more."
2,"I think gays give up too much when they use the genetic argument to deflect moral judgments of their lifestyle. Obviously, being gay isn't like deciding to eat ice cream. It arises out of a complex array of choices made as one grows up. It would be silly to claim that everything we like in life is the result of our DNA, and this applies to sexual preference as well. It's equally silly to claim that homosexuality is immoral because it's not 'natural', especially if what's natural is based on animal behavior. We're humans. How much of what we do is natural by that standard? Is kissing natural?  My verdict would be that homosexuality is neither genetic nor immoral. It's one way for humans to live. There is a great deal of self destructive behavior that both homosexuals and heterosexuals indulge in with regard to their sex lives. That kind of behavior is wrong, but the preference itself is not. "
1,"Certainly, all that you like and dislike is the result of genetic predisposition, however, it is not a result of genetics alone. There is no true question of whether a behavior is genetic or environmentally induced - all human behavior is necessarily a product of both. Genetics establishes which choices are open to you given the context you find yourself in. Naturally, if you have a predisposition to sex with those of your same gender but there are only choices among those of the OPPOSITE gender, if you wish to have sex, you MUST choose among those available to you OR choose not to have sex at all. The same is true of heterosexuals. That you prefer sex with the opposite gender in no way implies you MUST engage in only that type or cannot choose otherwise given different circumstances.That I am genetically predisposed for talent in drawing, painting, or carpentry doesn't imply I MUST engage those talents. So too, that I am genetically handicapped in my ability to understand and perform in mathematics or music or languages in no way implies I CAN'T at least try and enjoy those experiences. One has no choice in one's genetics, however, one always has choice in the expression of those predispositions.That one is born with the sexual organs of a female in no way implies one must have sex with a male and vice versa. It also does not imply one cannot alter one's anatomy to live the life of a different gender or no specific gender at all. Indeed, there are persons who are conceived and born with precisely that non-polar form. My hair is predisposed to grow until the day I die, however, I choose to cut it from time to time. Genetics gave me brown hair, however, I can choose to die it red. Genetics gave me two legs of a specific length, however, I can choose to medically lengthen or shorten them or choose not to use them at all. Genetics establishes the parameters for choice but it does not make the choices themselves."
1,"In my experience people who have feelings for the same or opposite sex often wish they did not. After all many relationships start with irrefutable infatuation, followed by much pain as couples hurt each other yet cannot separate.  There are men who just find other men more attractive even whilst they fear what their friends will say. They just dont find women attarctive enough.   I have had clients who have pleaded with me to help them change their feelings, to no avail.It does not seem likely that a person can be made to feel gay or heterosexual by external influences though people can follow trends unless their feelings stop them.One thing is clear.  The   law  , public opinion, persecution or persuasion are as unlikely to change sexual inclination as preventing drug or   alcohol   use.  And there is enough   crime   to indicate   the law   has little influence over that, either.     "
2,"I feel sorry that this is how you see relationships... This is not an insult but just an observation, there are people who are pathetic and see relationships this way; not all relationships are based on pain... since you are speaking from your experience, I feel sorry for you.  "
1,"Hi, Visavismeyou, I was heterosexually married for 19 years and went through adulation, disillusionment and acceptance into love. (My wife died so I cannot testify as to my ability to have a longer term relationship.) Whist studying therapy and working with individuals and couples I realised, as I did with my own relationship, that many do not realise that disillusionment is just a phase to be worked through.  My experience, as a therapist, caused me to start helping clients overcome the disillusionment stage. I have had some successes and failures, as might be expected.  Such people may feel pathetic but amount to as much as 50% of people in relationships.  This is a conservative estimate, as the number of divorces or unhappy marriages will testify      People who are ""gay"" or ""homosexual"", as used to be the label, often think they are wrong, unnatural or weird. Thus they start off their relationships doubting their abilities to love or the rightness of their choice. These doubts   add   to the 50% chances of failure and may give rise to lack of lasting relationships between persons of the same sex, compared to heterosexual ones. My argument, in the earlier section, is that the choice to be gay or not is one that is felt.  Even if the person thinks it it wrong their feelings have more influence on their behaviour than their thoughts, including judgments.   After all, it is considered quite normal for a man or woman to have strong attractions to each other.  Circumstances and common sense may stop them but their urges are there and an appropriate relationship will allow them to meet the right person and go through the mature processing of adulation, disillusionment, acceptance and love. Where an attracted couple are of the same sex they invariably take account of more internal and external judgments than heterosexual couples, as well as going through the mature processing of adulation, disillusionment, acceptance and love.  In conclusion, the decision to feel ""gay"" or heterosexual is not one to be mitigated by   legal  , moral or persuasive argument.  Or, to put it more crudely, I could not be persuaded to be sexually aroused by a male body on pain of death and my pretences would not deceive a male partner.                 "

If being queer is perceived to be a mental disorder OR something the gay person 'chooses' to be, or could go to therapy to change, then it would be socially acceptable to stigmatize, punish, and generally discriminate against gay people.    If being queer is innate (just like being left handed), then it doesn't make sense to punish or discriminate against gay people any more than it does to discriminate against left handed people, or ANY minority group (and everyone is a member of some minority group or the other).Why is it so hard for Hope7 to accept as normal anyone who is different from themselves?

Do heterosexuals have more fragile sexual identities that cannot tolerate differences?Live and let live is the only way to get along in a world with too much hatred and bigotry."

I have always been mystified by the extreme emotion, even violence, engendered in certain people against homosexuals. It is what we call 'out of proportion'.""It is actually obeying the definition of ""normal"" and ""weird"" to say that people who are different from me are ""weird"".  That is just the fact of the word.  The   environment   I have grown up in dictates what I see as normal and weird.  This is a layover (perhaps vestige) of our   evolution  .  A homosexual does not find heterosexuals as weird because the homosexual has grown up in an environment wherein heterosexuality is ""normal"", the opposite is not true.  The reason why we look down upon those whites who are   racist   or bigots is not because they find Blacks or Jews or Mexicans as weird, it is because they are unintelligent enough so as to be unable to deal with the differences and learn and move on.  Be very precise about why it is wrong to be racist and you'll see what I mean; it is natural for a white person to think a black person weird and vice versa, it is socially acceptable to think them weird, it is not socially acceptable to act on that prima facia judgment.

1,"Your analogy of homophobia to   racism   is well chosen and fills in some points I left out above.  But still unexplained to me is the depth of the hatred and hostility or resentment that some hold against minority groups.   I've never truly understood the 'out of proportion' emotion which is felt by some racists or homophobes.   In other words, it appears to be something more than simply considering something or someone 'weird'  and letting them be.  The response in some appears to be more one of intense hatred or fear, sometimes resulting in violence against the 'weird'.   But I still think you make a good point in stressing the importance of   environment  .    Not because environments of any size where there are no homosexuals (they are everywhere) but because our environment is a powerful factor in learning racism or homophobia.   You imply that thought and behavior is learned, with which I agree and find hopeful because this means racism and homophobia can also be unlearned, usually by positive interactions with known members of a minority group.   >>A homosexual does not find heterosexuals as weird because the homosexual has grown up in an environment wherein heterosexuality is ""normal"", the opposite is not true.<<As above, this depends on definition of 'normal' (open social acceptability in the current culture in which a person lives or grew up vs. biologically normal variant existing world wide as long as there have been humans)."

1,"Twin studies DO demonstrate a genetic link.  Every notable twin study has shown that a greater percentage of monozygotic twins shared the same sexual orientation than the percentage of dizygotic twins. The fact that not all monozygotic twins share the same sexual orientation does not disprove a genetic link.  It simply suggests that other factors, most likely intrauterine, are involved -- most likely a complex process involving the mutation of certain fragile genes during early cell replications, along with hormonal changes which alter brain chemistry, received more by one twin than the other.  Monozygotic twins nearly always have some perceptible physiological differences, including mirror-image,where one twin is left-handed and has left-handed hair whorls, while the other is the opposite; size differences, due to unequal uterine blood supply; and even being of opposite genders, due to genetic mutations which take place after the the cell division in which the twins divide from one another. One would not expect that 100% of monozygotic twins would share the same sexual orientation.  But the fact that a higher percentage of monozygotics do than dizygotics is a highly-reliable indication that sexual orientation is a genetically-linked trait.  "

It is a meta-analysis of 21 gay   parenting   studies. The harm children sustain from engaging in the gay life-style is well documented in the peer-reviewed scientific literature we cite.

You are not alone: More than 40% of men with same-sex attraction have been raped and/or sexually molested.  This is a well-accepted psycho-social factor that can contribute to same-sex attraction.  Many men in this situation have been healed with psychiatric therapy directed at resolving the trauma associated with the sexual abuse (as opposed to re-orientation therapy per se).

Statistics showthat homosexual men, who represent less than 3 percent of the adultmale population, commit a disproportionate number (one-third or more cases of child sexual molestation. The report, ""Homosexualityand Child Sexual Abuse,"" authored by Dr. Timothy J. Dailey (availableat   www.frc.org  .), is being sent to parents, youth groups, schooladministrators, Catholic bishops, and religious organizations.FRC's report comes at a time when the nation has been rocked byscandals of child sexual abuse and when homosexuals argue that youthorganizations such as the Boy Scouts should be forced to includehomosexuals as leaders. Similarly, gay activist organizations areencouraging homosexual teachers to share their sexuality with theirstudents. Many parents have become concerned that   children   may bemolested, encouraged to become sexually active, or even ""recruited""into adopting a homosexual identity and lifestyle.""Homosexuality and Child Sexual Abuse"" examines the following evidencelinking homosexuality to pedophilia:Pedophiles are invariably males: Almost all sex crimes againstchildren are committed by men.Significant numbers of victims are males: Up to one-third of all sexcrimes against children are committed against boys (as opposed togirls).The 10 percent fallacy: Studies indicate that, contrary to theinaccurate but widely accepted claims of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey,homosexuals comprise between 1 to 3 percent of the population.Homosexuals are overrepresented in child sex offenses: Those among the1 to 3 percent of the population that is sexually attracted to thesame sex are committing up to one-third of the sex crimes againstchildren.Some homosexual activists defend the historic connection betweenhomosexuality and pedophilia: Such activists consider the defense of""boy-lovers"" to be a legitimate gay rights issue.Pedophile themes abound in homosexual literary culture: Gay fiction aswell as serious academic treatises promote ""intergenerationalintimacy.""""Children have become the last sexual frontier,"" FRC President KenConnor said.

This article dispells those fears and shows through actual scientifc study and research that one can change their sexual attractions and decide for themselves whom they will be attracted to and respond. Apparently in 1973 the APA adopted a principle to always have public declartions backed up by research and not follow public opinion but some how according to Dr. Jones has forgone that directive to bow to cultural pressures in regards to many things including sexual orientation. This lack of professionalism has caused quite a rift in the scientific world regarding the APA making any public pronouncements.

2,"Quote:These circumstances made me a magnet for manipulation so at the age of 13 an older boy in my   church   sexually molested me. The feelings in my heart became a vortex of battling conflicts. I hated his touch and I longed for his touch. I hated liking his attention and I hated not having his attention.Over the next three years, I was forced to bear ""Ray's"" relentless obsession with me. Thankfully, we never had sex. When I finally left the church in disgust, I left home and plunged headlong into the gay lifestyle. The sight of men dancing with each other and publicly kissing made me feel so good. I felt like I was finally in a place where I belonged. In 1980, my first year of   college   I dove headlong into   homosexuality   and all it had to offer. I was new on the gay scene; soon everyone was asking who I was and who I was dating. I went to house parties, orgies, got hooked on ""poppers"" and started drinking. I was like a kid in a candy store with no parents around! In 1982, I hid my homosexuality so I could join the Army. I traveled all over the world and everywhere I could always find another man to have sex with. I went through periods of deep depression, when I felt so lonely I wanted to die. When I came out of my depression, I had to have sex to make me feel powerful and secure. I developed a hard attitude toward others, even my lovers. People existed to give me pleasure; when I was finished, I simply discarded them. At the height of my life as a gay man I felt invincible! No one could stop me, not even God. ""I don't care if I go to hell!"" I told God when I felt convicted about my sexuality. But I  was still unhappy and unfulfilled. Thoughts tormented me that I now believe came from satan: You can find sex partners anytime you want, but none of them love you. It was an attempt to push me further along the path of self destruction. After years of homosexual sex in all its devaluing forms, I still felt unloved and worthless. That was over 14 years ago. Of course, there were many issues to confront as I started down the road to total healing.  Healing was and is a process that I embrace with all my heart. God directed me to a church, where I stayed for five years, rising to become second assistant pastor. I was moving away from the residual issues of anger, hatred, and improper sexual passions. Yet I still had to deal with new challenges. Would I be accepted in the church? Would the men sense my homosexual past? Was I really free? Over the next few years, God proved his faithfulness by allowing me to build healthy relationships with godly men who loved me without prejudice. They didn't realize it, but God was using them to heal me of feelings of self-worthlessness. Eventually, I met a young woman who had begun attending the same church and we became friends. Over the next year, God confirmed in many ways that we belonged together. My passions changed and I knew God had created me to love a woman, not a man.  Before I proposed to Dee, I told her about my past. ""Honey"" she responded, ""if God has forgiven you, so do I.""  We were married and began our life together. Today, almost 12 years later that woman, Dee— is still my wife, and is still the most beautiful woman in the  world. She’s the   mother   of my four   children   and the love of my life.END QUOTE  http://www.witnessfortheworld.org/dlfoster.html  "

Neither of them is gay.When he passed away the obituary emphasized that it was lung cancer he died from and not aids.Since I respect the overwhelming power of the sex drive and what it can make one do I tend to analyze the idea that all species have gays a bit differently. It is not so much a matter of being born with a""different orientation"" but rather a matter of opportunism. For instance there are males of all species that will screw anything that holds still for them! It is only a small step from this to men being with men because the opportunity exists or is considered a ""better"" or ""easier"" way to get ""satisfaction"", and you don't need to adjust to the differences (foibles) of ""the other sex"".Other than that I do believe one can control their own destiny to a very, very considerable extent- so even with any underlying ""orientation"" toward being gay one could resist it,Hal 84"
2,"""Yet despite this reality, we still come out.""Is it despite this reality that some people come out? Or because of it? I'm not an expert (it's obvious if you read my other comments on things) but that doesn't stop me from having my own theories. Research shows   children   who are raised by   homosexual   couples are more likely to be   gay   themselves. That seems to me not an indication of increased   tolerance   but an affirmation that the social aspect is a lot more influential in a person's sexual orientation than is given credit for. That's the only theory based on evidence now hear one on experience if you would. Part I think is due to what I would call the ""under dog"" complex, or a separate term ""emotional masochism"". Take this all with a grain of salt if you would. Here in America the under dog is idolized. The valiant struggle for rights, the strength of will to be the downtrodden of   society   and emerge a ""better"" person than before is portrayed in hundreds of movies and real life stories. How many people want that image of themselves? I know I do and I'll gladly admit it. But I prefer to be a different kind of minority. The white male between 19-25 years of age that goes to   college   full time has a steady job gets good grades respects women and keeps a clean apartment minority. If you look at where I'm going to school you might be surprised to learn that even here being ""responsible"" is a rarity. As for the emotional masochism my last roommate was the perfect test case example. Allow me to explain, Up all night ""studying"" listening to rock music on his head phones he complains that he can't remember anything he ""learns"". No duh. With the same situation he complains it takes him an hour to do a math problem. No duh. (What does he do during the day you ask? Watches TV) He complains that he can't keep a steady girlfriend for some unknown reason. (He's cheated on the last 3 and news travels fast). Is there a cure to his ills? Yes there is. Have we told him when he's asked us what to do? Yes we have. Did he listen? No. Why not? The only conclusion I can find is that he likes to have this ""right"" to complain about how rough his life is. Although she may not like me quoting her ""Livvy"" had a point when she said, ""Yeah...and...who hasn't?"" Life is rough. Parents, good ones bless their hearts, tell you that you you have the potential to be anything you want when you grow up. Do we all really believe that?"

2,"And this book:As Nature Made Him : The Boy Who Was Raised as A GirlAuthor: John Colapinto In 1967, after a baby boy suffered a botched   circumcision  , his family agreed to a radical treatment. On the advice of a renowned expert in gender identity and sexual reassignment at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the boy was surgically altered to live as a girl. This landmark case, initially reported to be a complete success, seemed all the more remarkable since the child had been born an identical twin: his uninjured brother, raised as a boy, provided to the experiment the perfect matched control.The so-called twins case would become one of the most famous in modern   medicine   and the social sciences; cited repeatedly over the past thirty years as living proof that our sense of being male or female is not inborn but primarily the result of how we are raised. A touchstone for the feminist movement, the case also set the precedent for sex reassignment as standard treatment for thousands of newborns with similarly injured, or irregular, genitals.But the case was a failure from the outset. From the start the famous twin had, in fact, struggled against his imposed girlhood. Since age fourteen, when finally informed of his medical history, he made the decision to live as a male. John Colapinto tells this extraordinary story for the first time in As Nature Made Him. Writing with uncommon intelligence, insight, and compassion, he also sets the historical and medical context for the case, exposing the thirty-year-long scientific feud between Dr. John Money and his fellow sex researcher, Dr. Milton Diamond--a rivalry over the nature/nurture debate whose very bitterness finally brought the truth to light. A macabre tale of medical arrogance, As Nature Made Him is first and foremost a human drama of one man's-and one family's--amazing survival in the face of terrible odds. The human intimacy of the story is all the greater for the subject's courageous decision to step out from behind the pseudonym that has shrouded his identity for the past thirty years."

2,"The fact that there may or may not be negative consequences for a certain action or belief is not a good guideline to determine whether a person is choosing to do them.  ""Why would so many of us make this ""choice"" if we didn't have to?""Extemporaneously I can answer this quite easily.  The lack of knowledge of a choice does not preclude the possibility of a choice.  Furthermore, it does not follow logically that if someone makes a choice that he or she understands the potential consequences sufficiently so as to dissuade his or her mind from making that choice.  Finally, just because a choice may carry with it negative consequences does not mean he or she will choose against it.  Quite obviously, many people make choices which harm themselves (if you consider   homosexuality   and its consequences as “harmful”, which apparently you do) all of the time.  Take the monk whose self-immolation is quite famous.  He made a choice to set himself on fire… Under your line of reasoning, no one would ever smoke, do   drugs  , wear high-heels… etc.  Facts and common observation disagree with your method of reasoning.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th  %C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c"
1,"You object to arguments being made without solid scientific proof, and yet the ""gay-is-a-choice"" side of this discussion has pretty much zero in the way of valid, peer-reviewed scientific backup for their claims.  When they DO cite a scientific study, careful review of their cite nearly always results in discovery that the study they cite did not prove anything approaching the claims they make, and generally was not even designed to test the hypothesis they are claiming it tested.If you want to go after people for making non-scientifically-based claims, go after the people who continually spout religious pseudo-science to justify their continued harassment of gays."
1,"US troops are professional enough to tolerate gay peers. The argument that the presence of gay troops will undermine morale and unit cohesion is premised on the idea that US troops are unable to handle their emotions and maintain their professional focus in the presence of gay peers. This is an insult to the professionalism of US soldiers. They can easily maintain their mission focus and strong morale in the presence of homosexuals. And, any troop that cannot do so is simply not living up to the standards of the US military. Their poor performance as such should not be a factor in driving military policy against gays.

1,"Societies frequently practiced infanticide, because they had no birth control and no measures to help single mothers or too many babies at once. ""Natural"" was ""necessary."" The Greeks looked down on heterosexuality because it seemed ""natural"" to them; it was an animal thing, and thus homosexuality was ""higher."" Heterosexuality isn't ""right"" because it's ""natural,"" either. We deem it right when healthy adults identify as it and build good relationships with it, and deem it wrong when it's misused, as when it's done without consent or with a minor. "
1,"Infanticide has never been acceptable in the US... although it was practiced in the days before birth control and   abortion  , and widely. I don't believe there is a society that has never practiced it. Yeah, we're in agreement. I think it's important to remember there are those two sides of the coin, and jumped in only to add a little weight to that point. It's true that homosexuality being a perfectly natural thing doesn't mean that it's inherently good. It also doesn't make it inherently evil. Just like, well, heterosexuality. "
2,"wow, infanticide necessary.  Ancient Greek reasons were varied but it is no different than the reasons the Chinese and US has for aborting and abandoning their   children  .  Oedepus Rex (play by Sophcles) is poetic justice.  The reasons vary but   society   (me and others with a conscience) know it was wrong and evil.  Just the same as some Germans knew it was wrong but part of their ruling society allowed the Jews to be gassed.  "
1,"Think about your sisters and brothers for a moment. Better yet, everyone's. They're probably very alike in at least some ways, physically, in personality, or in the traits they pass on to their kids, because they have the same genetic source: the parents. Now imagine that a gay or lesbian person was in a primitive family many thousand years ago. They wouldn't have their own kids, but that would free the person up to help watch out for their sibling's kids. They'd also be useful on hunting or gathering trips, because they could do just as much work as anyone else, but they wouldn't take as big a share for their family. We can actually see this in the black-backed jackal. Often, an adult pup will come back and help raise the next litter. Does that jackal spread its genes that year? No. Does it help spread its family's? Yep. Did black-backed jackals who did have the gene outspread those who didn't, making this a common trait among all jackals? Yep. The first jackals with that mutation found evolutionary success. You don't have to win the evolutionary game by propagating your own genes. You can succeed just as well by making sure your family genes survive. "
1,"Actually, there is a scientifically high probability that homosexuality contributes positively to the well-being of the species.  Typically, genetic traits which lead to reproductive success are the most strongly and consistently represented traits in a population.  After all, if you have a gene which makes you reproductively successful, you are likely to reproduce more and therefore your trait will continue strongly into the next and subsequent generations.And yet, there is good evidence that a small but fairly consistent percentage of the population has been homosexual throughout recorded history.  Since a ""gay gene"" would tend to detract from reproductive success (yes, you can snicker now :) ), why would such a gene be selected for?  The fact that we are beginning to discover that there is not one singular ""gay gene,"" but rather most likely a complex interaction of genes (and probably some factors from the intrauterine environment, as well) which cause an individual to be same-gender-oriented, suggests that some of those genes may also be beneficial to the species in other ways, perhaps providing protection from disease or other reproductively-desirable traits.  Think of the gene which causes Sickle-cell Anemia.  This gene is recessive, and will not cause disease if it is inherited from only one parent.  If inherited from both parents, the offspring manifests the disease, which can be deadly.  This gene is nearly non-existent in much of the world's population, because its tendency to reduce life-expectancy means that it does not give a reproductive advantage under normal circumstances, and therefore self-extinguishes after a number of generations.However, in areas of the world where Malaria is common, like Africa, this gene provides a distinct reproductive advantage, in that someone who is a carrier of the gene (has the recessive from one parent but not from the other) is given some degree of immunity to Malaria, and therefore has a reproductive advantage over someone with no Sickle-cell gene at all.  Therefore, in African populations, there is a high occurrence of Sickle-cell Anemia, because more carriers are at a reproductive advantage over non-carriers.The same is likely true with some or all of the genes which influence sexual orientation.  While Uncle Bill may get the full set and find that he is attracted to other men, Aunt Jane may only receive a partial set of the genes and actually be more fertile than other women, or produce offspring which are smarter, more attractive or otherwise have a survival and/or reproductive advantage.  Those offspring will also be carriers of some or all of the set of genes which increase the probability of becoming same-gender-oriented.  Some of them may marry spouses who carry some of the complement of genes, and may, themselves, produce one or more gay offspring.It really does make sense from an evolutionary perspective."
2,"Homosexuality is incompatible with military service. Homosexuality is simply incompatible with the principles of military services, which include a focus on the mission, service, discipline, bodily integrity, and control over one's impulses. Homosexuality does not appropriately reflect these principles. This sentiment was reflected in an article signed by Gen. Carl E. Mundy, Jr., a former commandant of the Marine Corps; Adm. Leighton W. Smith, a former commander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe; Gen. Charles A. Horner, who commanded U.S. aerial forces during the 1990-91 Gulf War; and Adm. Jerome L. Johnson, a former vice chief of Naval Operations. They wrote, succinctly, ""homosexuality is incompatible with military service"".[6]

1,"I didn't see any comments suggesting that human genes should be modified.  Are you referring to people who think ""gay"" can be ""fixed"" through genetic manipulation?  I certainly did not suggest that, nor do I think such a thing would be desirable.  Maybe I'm just not following, so perhaps you can elaborate."
1,"Okay, yes, I'd agree with you.  I have a problem with people who believe that if a gay gene were identified, it should be modified so that gays would cease to exist.  It's not that I necessarily want there to be a continual population of gay people.  I'm fairly neutral on that score because, in today's society, being gay is, while less difficult than it was 30 years ago when I came out, still very painful and difficult for most of us.  But I believe that being gay is morally neutral, and do not wish to see a slice of genetic diversity eliminated from the ""whole pie.""  If the presumptive sequence of ""gay genes"" does provide some other adaptive qualities to humanity, then eliminating them could have untold disastrous consequences.Consider ""stereotypically gay"" behaviors -- an interest in (and often, impressive talent for) the arts, painting, design, music, philosophy, literature.  If it is true that these genes are linked to those characteristics, as might seem plausible, how many great works of music would never be composed, great works of art never painted, great treatises never written if the genetic make-up which could play a part in enabling these abilities were destroyed in the name of ""curing gay""? Perhaps the creativity in each of us is linked to our personal complement of one or more of these theoretical ""gay genes.""  Maybe the combination of all of them produces a gay individual, but the individual expression of one or two simply produces a person with talent or creativity in some area.  Should we muck around and destroy it?  I don't think so."
2,"You know that is all conjecture.  I don't even think it is a reasonable hypothesis to compare it to a protective gene that causes sickle cell anemia.  All subjective opinion. We only know that   homosexuality   exist in humans, we know that sexual drive is plastic, we know that people can abstain from sex (hetero or homo) or even change from one to the other.  We do not have any conclusive genetic studies.  We do have a lot of environmental/psychological studies, which shows some correlation.  I am open to any rigorous data.God bless  "
1,"No, we do NOT know that ""people can...change from one to the other.""  What we know is that there is some percentage of the population which is innately bisexual, and may fall in love with or be attracted to members of his or her own gender as well as the opposite.  Such people could correctly be described as having a ""choice.""  However, they do not make up the sum total of the population.  There are significant percentages on either end who are either exclusively (or nearly so) attracted to members of the opposite gender, or exclusively (or nearly so) attracted to members of their own gender.As to a gene, or more likely a SET of genes, which give evolutionary advantage to those who carry some or all of them, the hypothesis, however difficult it might be to prove, is a good one, as we have any number of examples of such genetic characteristics in the data already, including the sickle cell example I gave earlier.  Can I prove the hypothesis?  Of course not.  Not yet, anyway.  Geneticists are finding new information about the human genome every day.  The probability that a genetic link will be found is strong.  And considering the abilities, behaviors and talents which can be readily identified in a significant percentage of the gay population, it is highly likely that there is a significant evolutionary advantage conferred by that set of genes, whether it be in creative abilities, or in more prosaic areas such as enhanced abilities to form the family and group bonds which were the basis of individual safety and strong social networks in the early history of human civilization.  For an example of this type of genetic advantage resulting from genetic ability to interact sexually with members of either gender, study Bonobo social bonding and conflict resolution strategies."
2,"Call it bisexual or call it moving on from   homosexuality  .  That is why I said sex is plastic.  I will check up on Bonobo social bonding etc... but if the core data is from other primate studies....I really doubt it then, but I should not be bias until I see it.    Of course, not all physiological/morphological expressions can be attributed to one gene (1:1)--there are secondary, tertiary etc... levels of gene interactions and not to forget the myriad levels of hormones/steroids (endocrine/exocrine).My concern is to come across, with   science  , that there is no more room for argument and discussion, because science has not provided the proof in the pudding either way on this issue.  Not that you have done this yest, just my general concern.  Science can and is shedding light but there is a large difference between normative and descriptive.  Humans cannot live on science alone (normative) but must hold on to all the arts (which also reveal/has truth)."
1,"It is not proven by any means that sexual orientation is mutable.  Just because some people are bisexual does not prove that any and every person could change his/her innate sexual orientation.  Clearly, the physical capability exists for most people to interact sexually with a person of either gender, but that does not equate to a basic orientation of bisexuality.  Most people are FAR more attracted, physically and emotionally, to the opposite gender than to their own gender.  They cannot wilfully change this orientation to force themselves to feel the same degree (or even close) of attraction towards persons of their own gender.  In the same way, a smaller segment of the population is FAR more attracted, physically and emotionally, to people of the same gender, and  cannot wilfully change this orientation to force themselves to feel the same degree (or even close) of attraction towards persons of the opposite gender."
2,"I agree with the idea that our animal nature, in most cases, does not dictate that we be either ""gay"" or straight.""  And there are many reasons (e.g., overpopulation) why ""gayness"" might be favored in nature.  Studies of primates and other animals show this.  But our Judeo-Christian morality does offer solid guidance.  When a young person begins to mature sexually, they are as malleable as clay.  It is at this point that, without the constraints of culture or morality, they can grow into whatever (often bizarre) adult they choose (usually unconsciously) to shape themselves into.  Just like an animal.  "

1,"And maybe discuss the difference between ""Judeo-Christian"", ""Judaic"", and ""Christian.""Firstly, Judeo-Christian was a word that was invented by Christians and confuses and worries most Jews. Jews and Christians have very different ideas around morality, the nature of willpower and mankind, what role the laws play in every day life, etc. So let's create that disconnect, please.Judaic morality says that, at best, men lying with men is a sort of odd, inexplicable thing and at worst is an abominable act. On the subject of lesbianism, there's no rule against it, but since it was practiced by the Egyptians, we're supposed to not do it.Very few of the mitzvhot are moral in nature. Few can debate the MORALITY of keeping kosher. We can discuss the USEFULNESS of it, but the morality is somewhat seperate.Also, Quincey, in response to your statement: ""Judeo-Christian morality excludes all other religious and non-religious morality."" should really read ""Christian morality"". Jewish morality has very specific people to whom it applies, namely Jews. If you're not one of us, we do not and should not care what you do. Jews will probably not like same-sex marriages being performed in their temples, but throughout the US at least, most Jews support it, filing it under ""things that don't really affect us but make some people happy"".Anyways. JudeoChristian=not a thing. Thanks."

1," What you just listed are known as the Laws of Moses. After Jesus was crucified, these laws, such as not eating shellfish were no longer applicable to Christians. However,   homosexuality  , unlike the other laws, is mentioned again in the New Testament. Please actually read up on these things before accusing the Bible of condoning slavery and stoning people. "
1," The passages in the Bible you listed don't condone slavery, in my opinion. But they do acknowledge it exists and is very common, and basically talks about slaveowners and slaves treating each other properly. For example, saying that slaveowners should not beat their slaves is nothing controversial to me, or saying that good deeds a slave does for their master are counted equally by God."
2,"While there are ""homosexual""   animals   these animals only participate in sexual activities for procreation. In other words they HAVE to in order to further their species. Humans and dolphins are the only 2 mammals that have sex for pleasure. Humans do not have the ability to procreate thru homosexual activities, thus one can conclude we are not born homosexual."
2,"This animal kingdom reference is shallow and jumping the gun.  Lets look at other primates and dogs as examples.....we have all seen the male and male copulation simulation on TV and the local dog park.  We cannot conclude these acts as   homosexuality   as we humans understand it.  It is understood as either an act of dominance or part of a calming/making up activity.  These actions are not exclusive from heterosexual activities if given the chance to mate.  Please be more specific about your case studies (natural history). Another point.  What is natural?  Yes, it is natural for an outside male lion to challenge the male lion of the pride.  After the new lion wins...he kills all the young of the previous leader of the pride.  Many do misunderstand this as you did with the animal kingdom homosexuality issue and call it murder.  No it is not murder.  Both of these issues that I brought up (homosexuality and murder) allows us to compare and contrast human from non human   animals  .  The only factor that makes sense of these comparison is human morality.  We do not call a bald eagle taking fish from an osprey as stealing in the sense that a thief can steal your   money  .  Human morals do not apply to other animals.  You are creating a fallacy called anthropomorphism. Excluding morality, your misunderstanding of the animal kingdom is the problem.  Given the chance these males that supposedly were acting in ""homosexual"" activity would breed with a female or the alpha female.    "
2,"To reduce your argument to a level of 'well, dogs do it too!'  seems so base as to hardly be worthy of response. Dogs eat their own feces at times too, but that doesn't seem to be a good rationale for suggesting that Humans should, or a good defense if one would.Homosexuality is a 'deviant' behavior. Now, I use that strong word precisely because I know it will generate a strong reaction to many. None the less, that is what   homosexuality   is. It is 'deviant'. Not so much in the sense that it is 'wicked', 'evil' or 'vile', but in the sense that it 'deviates' from the norm.Approximately 3% of the population are homosexual. That means 97% aren't. Therefore, homosexuality 'Deviates' greatly from the norm. Society (The People) at large also have Rights and the Constitutional ability to voice their Rights . And, in State after State where the question has been put to The People, homosexual marriage has failed dismally. Personally, I hope the question becomes one of a Constitutional Amendment whereby The People are given the chance to voice their desires on what type of Society we shall live in. Take the matter out of the Courts and let The People decide. Naturally, homosexuals don't wish for that, because they know they could never win."
2,"There are 3 types of sexuality which we must define when talking about   homosexuality  .

Fact: 100% of all humans are heterosexual(1).  This is undeniable. Therefore this definition is irrelevant to our debate.“Homosexual” in the arena we are debating does not make any sense in the context of #(2). Homosexual(3) is all that is relevant to our debate.  I will now show how we cannot speak about   animals   in the third sense.  Fact: You have no idea whether I am attracted to men or   women   irrespective of what I tell you or how I act.  You cannot know to whom I am attracted, since this is undeniable, how could you know that animals are homosexual(3)?  The key word in your argument is: ""Seem"" in your third sentence.  This word deracinates any possibility that your argument means anything at all.  In order for us to take any meaning from the fact that animals perform some act and apply it to this discussion, we would need to know why they do this action.  Since we cannot know this, the point is moot.  Animals may perform some actions that, prima facie, are similar to actions which we deem as homosexual(3), these actions are irrelevant in this debate.

A historical analysis will prove your conclusion quite utterly wrong.  I completely agree, however, that scientific data must stand on its own and have no taint of belief in it (on either side).  The fact of the matter is that a historical analysis will be able to show that societies of nearly every conceivable belief system have existed.  Societies have practiced, promoted or at least tolerated polyandry, cuckoldry, polygamy and many other things we disapprove of for many reasons other than religious; ""we"" meaning a western-European society.  I'm sorry but history does not help your position."
1,"Jeremy,I am not an expert, but I wonder if perhaps your comment was too limited in what it addressed.  You only addressed behavior outcomes within the context of our current strongly pro heterosexual society.  I seem to remember studies from many years ago that concluded that the natural human tendency was for people to be born with congenital preference across the full spectrum between pure hetero and pure homo with the vast majority in various shades of bi.  This preference is then shaped by the rubric of current social values that lead to the outcomes you describe.That would imply that far fewer people are “born gay” than you might expect.  It also mean that far fewer people are “born straight” than you might expect as well.  The conflict comes from all of those people in the middle forced to conform to the imposed unnatural social values.  Normally you would expect that the closer you are to one end of the spectrum the easier it is to move your outcome to conform, but human nature is more complex than that.  Then you have to deal with people that have what I describe as angry reformed behavior complex.  I’m sure you know the type.  I made the sacrifice and quit (fill in what you want; smoking, drinking, being over weight, enjoying myself, whatever), “how dare you offend me and do that in front of me you weak willed sinner.”  Or the less angry who feel “I want to be good, please don’t tempt me to take my life down that road of social scorn.”"
1,"Yes, there is very likely choice involved for SOME people who fall more towards the middle of Kinsey's spectrum of orientation.  But the further one falls toward either end of the spectrum, the less choice is involved.  I think this is one of the difficulties gay people face in society.  There are a significant number of people, both in straight and gay relationships, who honestly recognize that they DID have a choice -- they COULD have fallen in love with someone of either gender.  These people are bisexual, even if they do not personally identify as such.  And many of them, both gay- and straight-identifying, generalize their experience to the rest of the population and assume that, because THEY had a choice, EVERYONE ELSE must also have had the same choice, must have the same feelings they experience.  This presents a problem for the people at the far-end of the gay side of the spectrum.  People at the ""straight"" end are not hurt by the issue of ""choice"" -- they have society's official okey-dokey and often simply assume that people in same-gender relationships are just ""perverse"" and have decided for some inexplicable reason to do something that the straight-end folks cannot imagine doing.The people more towards the middle just assume that everyone had they same choice they did, and that therefore, they should simply accept the ""consequences"" of that ""choice.""The people at the far-end on the homosexual side, however, know that they didn't have a choice.  Nobody ever gave them a choice.  They've been this way for as long as they can remember, and yet they have all the other people pointing a finger at them and telling them they MUST have chosen to be this way.  Of COURSE they must have.I said somewhere else that it is very much like the story of the blind men and the elephant.  Each of us finds ourselves touching the elephant's trunk or leg or flank or tail, and assumes that everyone else MUST be sharing the same experience.Not true.  If we could all learn a little empathy and learn to take people at their word when they are describing their experience as very different from our own, the world could be a much more understanding place to live."

1,"(I'm going to have to split this response into a series of posts, since you have brought up so many issues. Please pardon any inconvenience, but I want to be sure I address all of your points)Apparently my answer was not clear, since you have drawn so many incorrect conclusions from it.  Let me take them one by one:MARTIN: ""I see you marked YES to the question of whether or not people are born gay. But the presence of a spectrum at all necessitates the idea of choice (as you put it, ""for some"").""MY RESPONSE: Yes.  I believe people are born with the sexual orientation which they carry through life.  Some people are born exclusively (or nearly so) gay.  They are rarely if ever attracted to the opposite gender, and would be incapable of sustaining a meaningful and satisfying intimate relationship with a person of the opposite gender.  They may or may not be capable of completing a sexual act with someone of the opposite gender, but regardless of that ability or inability, could not have a satisfying marriage or long-term commitment to someone of the opposite gender.There are people who are similarly exclusive in their attractions to the opposite gender, and who would be incapable of sustaining a satisfying and fulfilling committed, long-term marital relationship with someone of their own gender, even if some of them could complete a sexual act with someone of their own gender.Then there are those who fall somewhere else along the spectrum, perhaps 50% attracted to their own gender and 50% to the opposite, or 75% to their own, and 25% to the opposite, or vice versa.  Such people might find a satisfying and sexually and emotionally fulfilling relationship with a person of either gender.My guess would be that the majority fall fairly close to the 90-100% ""straight"" end of the spectrum, with an increasingly sparse scatter towards the middle and ""gay"" end.The point, however, is that wherever they are on the spectrum, that is where they were born and that is where they will die.  Those who fall closest to the 50% mark at the middle of the spectrum experience their sexual orientation as a ""choice.""  This does not mean that they ""chose"" to be bisexual.  Their orientation is as it is.  Their choice comes from the fact that they experience attractions to both genders relatively equally, and have a choice to be equally satisfied with a ""gay"" or a ""straight"" relationship.There is nothing in my earlier post which contradicts this view.MARTIN: ""This is a question that necessitates something like a ""gay gene"" analogous to those who are born with male-pattern baldness or something like that. Studies confirm that men are born with the genetic code for male-pattern baldness. I have yet to see any conclusive study on this same type of thing for homosexuality. And yet I continue to hear about it over and over again . . . getting a little boring I think. ""I also find that the idea of bisexuality seems to contradict a ""gay gene."" It seems to me that the idea of being born a certain way means you either have it or you don't. Do you follow my logic? So, if someone has the gene, they are gay. If they do not, they are straight. But this is not the case at all. If a male child is born with ""male-pattern baldness,"" there is nothing he can do about it short of taking treatments or wearing a hairpiece or getting plugs. What you are saying is that there is a genetic make-up that means that certain people are 100% gay and certain people are 100% straight. This is not what Kinsey found and this is not supported by any studies that I know of. In Sexual Behavior and the Human Male, Alfred Kinsey wrote this: “Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats…The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects."" I agree with him and yet in the Western world we remain obsessed with categories."""
1,"The religious right believes that someone can be forced, or will themselves, into an end of the spectrum. I've known bisexual people to wake up one morning and be intensely attracted to men, then to women the next day. "
1,"MY RESPONSE: (Durnit, I wish they had block-quoting on here...) Yes, I do believe there is a ""gay gene,"" or rather, a series of recessive genes which must all be present in some combination in order to produce an exclusively homosexual individual.  You bring up the example of someone who is left-handed.  Left-handedness is not controlled by one single gene, but there is little denial that it IS a genetically-linked trait.  Additionally, the world (despite your freshman biology lesson on dichotomous keys) is not divided up into ""Right-handed People"" and ""Left-handed People.""  You certainly must be aware that some people are ambidextrous?  And there is considerable scientific research available into how the brains of such people work -- which areas light up and which do not during a variety of activities involving certain types of thought and the use of one or both hands.  Even your example of the person affected by male-pattern baldness is not nearly so clear cut as you make it sound.  Some people with male-pattern baldness become completely bald in a very short time, while others retain most of their hair for many years.  Some thin only a little in the front.  Others start with a large bare circle at the crown.  Genetics are not nearly as simplistic as our high school studies of ""dominant brown eyes"" and ""recessive blue eyes"" taught us to believe.  Genes can work in combination with other genes in complex interactions in which the failure of one single gene to properly ""turn on"" can lead the the failure of the entire process.Some genes are more fragile than others, as well.  While most genes replicate perfectly, time after time, division after division, yet there are some which tend to malfunction or mis-replicate quite frequently, leading to common genetic mutation disorders such as ""Fragile X.""It is likely that the ""gay genes"" may include some which are highly sensitive to subtle changes in the intrauterine environment.  This would go a long way towards explaining why, while monozygotic twins have a greatly increased likelihood of sharing the same sexual orientation as compared with dizygotic twins, still the co-incidence is not 100%.While I do not necessarily believe that Kinsey is the be-all and end-all expert on human sexuality, I do agree with many of his thoughts, including his view of a ""spectrum"" of sexual orientation.  As I've pointed out here, there is nothing in my model which is inconsistent with a spectrum.  Just as left-handedness is accepted as a genetically-linked trait, but is, itself, a point on a spectrum of hand-dominance, so, in all likelihood, is sexual orientation.  Nor is there anything about characteristics being genetically-linked which would deny the possibility that they could also fall within a spectrum.MARTIN: ""Can I ask you this: do you agree that sexuality develops out of a complex web of biological and environmental factors? If so, then can you really respond ""YES"" to the question of whether or not people are born gay?""MY RESPONSE: Yes, I do.  But there is nothing about that viewpoint which contradicts the idea that people are ""born gay.""  I believe that the environmental factors which assist in determining sexual orientation are intrauterine -- hormonal fluctuations, for instance.  Studies have shown that the more older biological brothers from the same mother a man has, whether or not they are raised together, the higher his likelihood of being gay.  The mechanism is thought to be an increased sensitization of the mother's immune response to the presence of a male fetus, similar to the effects of maternal (Rh-) exposure to first and subsequent pregnancies with Rh+ fetuses.  So, yes, whether being gay is 100% genetic (unlikely) or involves some environmental (probably intrauterine) influences upon the fetus' early development, I do believe that people are born gay (or straight, or somewhere along the continuum between the two, as determined by their specific genetic makeup and any environmental influences which have been exerted upon that genetic makeup) and that this sexual orientation is immutable.  "
1,"MARTIN: ""And I do not follow your reference to the old blind man and the elephant metaphor. Are you saying we are subjective beings? This is a pretty obvious point isn't it? And again, by bringing this up you have disproved your position. Really what the question at hand is about is whether or not there is a definitive genetic make-up for a gay person that will inevitably lead them to a homosexual lifestyle. I struggle to find this to be even a slightly defensible position.""MY RESPONSE: Hopefully by now you have come to realize (assuming you are familiar with the fable of ""The Blind Men and the Elephant,"" that my analogy is not nearly so nonsensical as you thought.  My point was that, while each of us lands somewhere upon the continuum between ""gay"" and ""straight,"" and cannot change our orientation, still some of us, as a function of where we land, experience sexual attraction as something which is primarily directed towards people of the opposite gender to our own, while some of us experience it as something which is primarily directed towards people of our own gender, and still others experience it as a ""choice"" in that they find themselves attracted to people of either gender.  That being the case, each of us, in relation to the continuum of sexual orientation, is like one of the old blind men in relation to the elephant in the story.  If we land near the the trunk, we believe that an elephant is a lot like a snake.  If we land near the tail, we are certain the elephant is most like a rope, etc.  In the same way, if we are born straight, we most likely assume that anyone who does not manifest heterosexual attractions and behavior is somehow simply a pervert.  If we are born bisexual to one degree or another, we assume that everyone has a choice, since we seem to have a choice, being attracted to one degree or another to people of both genders.  If we are born gay, I think most of us do understand quite clearly that the rest of the world does not easily identify with our sexual orientation, however, we understand their version of sexuality only by what we see in the culture around us, not by our own experience. We are, perhaps, best equipped of any group to understand the reality of others' experience, since we are surrounded by it, can clearly see that it exists and that it is real, and know without a doubt that it does not match our own."
1,"Sexual orientation and language are not alike in any way.  They arise from different parts of the brain and in very different ways, both in the individual and in the species.Instinctive sexual behavior has been part of the genetic make-up of the species (and its predecessor species) for millions of years longer than organized complex language (such as English and Swahili).  While most species have innate, instinctive capacities for some form of rudimentary or even relatively complex communication, the aspects of that communication which are instinctive and heritable are generally non-verbal, and are similar across all closely-related members of the species, even those which live in different geographic regions and have no contact with one another.  Humans have similar non-verbal, instinctive behaviors (sexual behaviors, among them).  But, while the capacity for spoken language is heritable (both the mechanical capacity and the mental capacity), the language, itself, is not inherited.Sexual behavior, though, is far more instinctive.  It is the basis of the species' survival (explaining why the majority of individuals in a species will always be primarily heterosexually oriented).  Heterosexual individuals do not LEARN to be heterosexual.  If heterosexual behavior had to be learned, then many, many species would have long since died out from lack of copulation and reproduction, because infants in the majority of species leave their mothers' care at the point when the   mother   is ready to mate again and bear more offspring.  They never have an opportunity to ""learn"" to be heterosexual.  In the same way, our sexual desires and behaviors are not, at their most basic level, learned.  They are instinctive.For a variety of reasons, most probably genetic, some possibly due to intrauterine hormonal fluctuations and exposures, a certain percentage of the human population (like that of most animal species) develops instinctive sexual traits which cause them to be sexually attracted to members of their own gender.This is nothing like language, or learning a new language.  Can someone who is innately heterosexual learn to engage in a homosexual sex act?  Of course they can.  Will this ever be ""natural"" for them?  Will this make them become innately sexually attracted to members of their own gender?  Of course not.  The only people who can readily imagine being attracted to members of either gender are bisexuals.  People who fall at either end of the spectrum of sexual orientation cannot choose to fall in love with the gender to which they are not innately attracted.  Can they learn to have sex with them?  Probably.  But I would hope we can all agree that having loveless, unfulfilling sex with no primary attachment of true attraction, love and devotion is not a good outcome and should not be anyone's goal. You can't learn to fall in love with a gender to which you are not attracted."
1,"if a man has what ever it takes to make them more attracted to men, they are simply going to find more persons that they look at being men, strike up more amorous conversations with men.  perhaps the ""less gay"" they are they increase the number of women they might date.  but we do know that many persons who are self declared as gay have dated women.  the lessons we learn from them was that they chose to be with women due to standards and expectations but that they only addmit they are gay, to themselves and perhaps others.  they readily report how the shape of a man, his scent and more were always tugging at them without permission.  I am gay and have never sought the company of a woman sexually, I have had opportunity and a flexible mind.  I have fallen in love with a girl as young adult and experiment you might say with kissing.  while i reveled in the intimacy of our kisses as an expression of loving her, I never got aroused by her scent, form or the mere thought of pleasure.  It is like how I will each a brussel sprout to force myself to a better diet but have never taken pleasure in it,  and don't get me started on beets.  I have such an adversion to everything I have experienced from them that I litterally cannot comprehend the words being used to describe them when people who like them as delicious.  I was never scared by a beet, I just taste metal when I eat them, not the sweet I hear so much about.  I choose to not eat beets but it is because I dislike the taste.  since alot of people eat beets is something wrong with me?  only a moral judgement would say yes as it hurts no one that I don't.  infact there are more beets for you.  if we all wanted or needed beets there could be a problem of scarcity when beet crops failed."

2,"To merely say ""We do not know, therefore yes, people can be born gay"" is not an argument for this position.  As others have pointed out, it is more closely a refusal of the position than a support thereof.  I portend that the only conclusion that can come from this debate is both sides (and people in the middle) to just throw up their hands and say some form of ""So what?"".  Are people born gay? Yes, so what?Are people born gay? No, so what? I completely agree that human sexuality is not binary by any means; but this does not attempt to answer the question, ""Are people born gay?"""
1,"I tend to doubt that there is a gene that ""causes"" Gayness but from my own observations I've seen Gay traits in pre pubescent children that grew up to be Gay. Whatever the cause it is not a conscious decision to ""become"" Gay I'm sure of that. If not at birth then the trait occurs at an early age. I have no problem with allowing government sanctioned Gay marriage and I'm a pretty conservative person."
2,"I believe that every human being is born genetically, physically, emotionally, spiritually and psychologically fallen.  No one is born perfect.  While I think it is far to simplistic to think that someone is born gay, the truth is that no one currently knows all of the factors that contribute to one's behavioral makeup.  I believe that genetics, environment and even our personalities factor into who we are and what we do.  As someone who never chose to ""feel"" gay, but who nonetheless found myself with those very real and complex desires, I admit that I do not know every reason why I experienced the sexual urges, impulses and attractions that I did starting at puberty.  However, I am extremely grateful for the fact that we live in a world where self determination is a high value.  Each individual has the God-given right to decide for themselves how they are going to respond to the impulses and attractions that they have.  For a period of my life I ""chose"" to act according to my feelings and when I realized that those actions weren't congruent with my greatest desire---to live according to my faith in Christ---then I ""chose"" to give up homosexuality and set out on the long, difficult but ultimately overwhelmingly fulfilling journey of putting Christ first.  Bottom line: just because something is ""genetic"" doesn't make it optimal, healthy or moral.  All sorts of things are said to have a genetic link from cancer to obesity to rage to alcoholism.  Not all of those things are immoral but they are all unhealthy and no one would choose them.  So, genetically linked or not, homosexuality isn't something that one has to live in tyranny under.  We each have a choice to make based upon our unchosen feelings and can decide how we are going to respond to our circumstances based on all of the facts.18 years after deciding to leave homosexuality I am thrilled that I did.  The life I lived as a celibate and single man was far more rewarding than gay life.  For 11 years now my life with my wife, Leslie, has been the greatest joy of my life as were the additions of my two adopted newborns in 2005.Rogaine for Women said it best a few years back: ""Stronger than genetics to overcome baldness.""  Certainly I have found that the human will, coupled in my case with my faith, are stronger than genetics to overcome a sexuality that doesn't fit with my beliefs or way of life."

1,"The word translated as ""homosexual"" is ""arsenokoitai."" Nobody knows what it means, because Paul apparently coined it  himself. Bible scholars think that Paul was either condemning sex with underage male prostitutes, or the rape of male prisoners of war. (Male prisoners were frequently sexually assaulted, and still are, as a show of control by their captors. The Vikings seem likely to have done it; so did the ancient Egyptians; so do modern armies. It was also thought at some times that by ""making them women,"" they would no longer be manly warriors.) "
2,"To say that ""nobody knows what it means"" in regard to ""arsenokoitai"" is completely incorrect and based on biased assumptive language - very poor debate form.""arsenokoite"" is a combination of the words ""arseno"" (male) and ""koite"" (bed, with a sexual connotation. We get our word ""coitus"" from this word).Paul, being a scholar of the Hebrew Scriptures, did with the Greek just as the Hebrew writers had done when writing what we know of as the Old Testament. They used the term ""mishkab zakur"" - ""mishkab"" meaning bed (with a sexual connotation), and ""zakur"", meaning male or males.When you say ""Bible scholars think that Paul was either condemning sex with underage male prostitutes, or the rape of male prisoners of war,"" would you care to quote these sources?

1,"Yes, while certainly a literal translations would be ""man-beds,"" what, exactly, did Paul mean by this.  Since he DID, in fact, apparently coin the word (there IS no concurrent usage of this word in unrelated Greek texts), there is no reason to assume that it refers to gay people as we know them.  There was certainly plenty of objectionable behavior going on in the culture surrounding Paul at the time he coined this word involving ""men"" and ""beds.""  The likelihood is that he was referring to male prostitutes, boy sex-slaves, or temple orgies.  The likelihood is that he was NOT referring to loving, committed, monogamous, covenantal relationships between two people of the same gender, anymore than the male rape discussed in re Sodom and Gomorrah was referring to loving, committed, monogamous, covenantal relationships between two people of the same gender.

If he had, he would have used the word ""paiderasste."" That was the standard Greek term at the time for sexual behavior between males.

They asked, ""Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?""Of COURSE he addressed this question regarding heterosexual people marrying and divorcing in terms of husbands and wives.  You think he would talk about two men in response to this question?  Or two women?  Ridiculous.He went on, though, later in that same chapter, to discuss ""Eunuchs who were born that way,"" which many scholars believe was a common manner of referring to men who did not prefer to have sexual relations with women.  He discusses such men in Matthew 19:12, and does not condemn them."
2,Read the NT in Romans...there are many versus in the NT.
1,"I think you are wrong to say people are not born gay or have a choice to be Gay or not. You are Gay, like it or not, but you choose not to act on it sexually because you believe it to be immoral or destructive or whatever. That's fine. It's similar to heterosexual men choosing a monogamous life style even though that may not be the natural way to be. It's a choice that you have decided works best for you."
2,"If someone such as the expert can choose to be straight in the sense that they chose to work on it and they changed why are they wrong to consider that people are not born gay or have a choice? Why do you assume that the expert's experience is illegitimate and just something like a choice to be monogamous?I know this relates also to the GAYDAR section but this topic is getting discussed and it ties in. I once had a customer who talked incessantly for a long period of time telling me how they didn't like talking to people and how people react etc. It seemed strange to me as they seemed to love to talk. Just before leaving they commented ""You are gay aren't you?"" I said ""no"". He was floored and left in silence. I then realized what he meant was that he don't like (talking to) straight people. That is just an example of what I have experienced. There does seem to be such a thing as a GAYDAR and I never could figure why I set it off among gay men. I didn't take too much interest for much of my life and advances that can result from setting off the GAYDAR I found flattering. Since the hormones kicked in I have never been sexually attracted to men so it did seem strange.Then I became a Christian. As a Christian you can't ignore agressive gay activists continually attacking your religion and screaming that a belief that God considers homosexual behaviour a sin is just an outlet of ugly discrimination against someone who was born that way. So I read up on the topic. What I found was the characteristic features of boys who grow up gay were exhibited by me as a child. Hell I even got teased with some very unflattering synonyms. It also reminded me of a massive change that I experienced around puberty which I attributed at the time to hormones and didn't give another thought to. I now believe I was wrong. Gay men had the same hormones and they stay on the same course. It provided the discovery that coincidental aspects of my environment just before I changed are the same things which psychotherapists consider gay boys are lacking. Certain experiences suddenly seemed significant. I didn't complete puberty with same sex attractions so there was no apparent issue. The sexual cravings from puberty found me a heterosexual. Although I do admit that right at the beginning I looked at a naked female photograph and thought to myself ""How will I get sexually aroused by that?"" and did wonder if I might be gay. The solution to those questions occurred naturally without any need for anything. When I became old enough I experienced heterosexual attraction and never looked back. The only vestige of that aspect of my life is being picked up on gay men's GAYDAR and a pretty effective GAYDAR of my own. Interestingly alot changed about me when I changed so heterosexual men not being as attuned to the subtleties don't ever think of me like that.Yep I'm a Christian so if I was gay now I'd want to change. But from what I've experienced and from what I've read I find the born that way argument very non-compelling and the expertise of people who assist people to change extremely compelling. I am extremely confident that the experience of the expert is legitimate. You can't discipline your sexual preference. He would have spontaneously developed a heterosexual orientation after deliberately tweaking his environment just like we spontaneously developed a heterosexual orientation due to our environment albeit in my case with a lot of luck.I also note that if my 'change' had occurred a few years later gay activists would have already insisted that I should come out and that I was born that way with an immutable sexuality. Personally I feel lucky that I wasn't in a position to buy into that bunk. How could someone forced into that type of belief change?"

I just wasn’t discriminating between what you were saying and my own paraphrasing. I’ll break it down and explain how I am interpreting and hopefully you will be able to then explain where you are coming from. In any case if we keep at it I’m sure we can get there.I’ll break up what I said into two bits. There is the bit about you assuming the expert’s experience is illegitimate. You make the claim that Alan Chambers is simply choosing not to act on his gay impulses and that there is nothing that he can do about being gay just like you could not make yourself attracted to men.Alan Chambers said: “I know that thousands of men and women defy – and continue to defy – any possible genetic or biological links to homosexuality and changed their sexual orientation through the help of caring individuals, counseling and faith-based support groups.”Certainly I am looking at it through the lens of my own experience but when he speaks of changing sexual orientation and speaks of his own experiences I take it to mean more than simply choosing not to act on gay impulses although that may have been the first step. By a change of sexual orientation I take it to mean that he has largely or completely lost his gay impulses in that he is either generally or completely no longer attracted to men. If I am correct then you consider his assertion and experience to be illegitimate when you assert that all that is involved is not acting on gay impulses and there is nothing that can be done about being gay and attracted to men. Does that make sense?I might as well add that the reason I chose you to respond to is that for someone in your situation to make the apparent pronouncement I feel disrespected to the extent that my experience overlaps with Alan's. I wouldn't feel that if a gay guy expressed that view.The second bit is the related. I am claiming that you are stating that his change of orientation is just like a decision to be monogamous. That is it is simply a case of not following urges. You used monogamy as an analogy and I inferred that in doing so you meant to communicate that nothing more is involved and that it is just an act of will power not a genuine change of orientation. Hopefully again this is sufficient explanation. Please feel free to let me know how I am misinterpreting.”BTW your experiences are yours alone and do not refute the overwhelming evidence that the vast majority of Gay men cannot change their sexual orientation.”I believe they give a better insight into the situation than your own experiences. Even if a majority either due to biological, environmental, or ingrained beliefs can’t change but a minority can why couldn’t Alan be in that minority?Barbaroni,Thanks for the response. That is not the way it appears to me. I've said what I've said but I can empathise with how you feel. I picture myself in your situation and believe that if I was you I'd feel frustrated with me. If so sorry."

As far as Alan being one of the minority who can ""change"", he could be bisexual so maybe he can go either way."

1,"What if it is not a gay gene.  What if a flood of hormones from mom cascade over the fetus?  What if the fetus' just developing glands squirt our the wrong hormone at just the right moment and that causes the homosexuality.Perhaps there is no gene, but limiting yourself to that straw-man is silly.The question was not ""Is there a gay gene"", it was ""Are people born gay?"""
1,"As it happens, ""gay"" or ""homosexual"" define behavior, NOT one's genetic makeup. As science has discovered, generally, when you determine a specific gene to be responsible for one characteristic or another, turning that gene on or off will affect not simply the characteristic you were interested in but also characteristics you didn't anticipate. What this means is, there can be no ""gay gene"" however, there are likely at least one or more genes that set the stage for a predisposition for homosexual behavior. That one has the gene or genes in no way implies one MUST behave as a homosexual. But, of course, the same is true of heterosexuality. Certainly, nature establishes the necessary mechanisms for individuals to reproduce themselves, however, what nature does NOT do is establish one MUST reproduce. Clearly, an individual can choose not to reproduce and most individuals do in that most individuals engage in non-reproductive sex regardless of the gender of their partner. Also, nature clearly has no regard for whether you reproduce or not, i.e., there is no individual reproductive imperative in order for the individual to live, in that nature creates some individuals without a clear polarity to their gender and also creates individuals unable to reproduce but with the outward appearance of one gender or the other, and yet many of these individuals live full lives regardless of their inability to reproduce. ""Survival of the species"" appears to be a human invention and not a natural imperative. The rest of nature appears not to be concerned in the least whether humans continue to exist. That is the concern of individual human beings alone.You could just as easily say, ""science doesn't support the ""heterosexual gene"" either. Heterosexuality is a behavior which is clearly always choice because heterosexual CAN choose otherwise even if they generally do not. Also, reproduction isn't always nor even usually the reason for heterosexual behavior in that individuals commonly choose not to reproduce so, reproduction is also always choice - even if the choice is often made without regard for its consequences.Heterosexuality is no more an imperative than is homosexuality, bisexuality or asexuality. All of these behaviors are chosen but chosen loosely based on one's genetic predispositions, one's experiences and within one's current context."

Speak up!The people arguing the origins of ""gayness"" are often the same people who don't believe all living things evolved from a common ancestor.  With all the overwhelming evidence in support of   evolution  , just how much evidence do you think it would take to convince a ""religious person"" that gayness might be a natural thing?  The ""religious community"" is immune to logical discussion.  Why are they even on these pages (Opposing Views)? They have little to add."
2,"Ayant  aussi  gouté l’intense douleur du rejet, la frustration qui émane des deux derniers commentaires m’émeut au plus haut point, cependant la question de fond n’est pas de contester aux homosexuels le droit au respect et à l’amour filial commun à tous les humains, mais de savoir quelle est la nature morale du comportement sexuel qu’ils adoptent.  À ce chapitre, à moins d’un trou juridique, il est un seul juge qui soit audible, une seule référence qui soit crédible; Dieu.  Quelle que soit mon attirance sexuelle de départ, je vous assure que je l’alignerais, ou la réformerais, sur ce que Dieu me dicterais; les opinions humaines contraires n’auraient pour moi aucune valeur face à la sienne.    Or Dieu existe, avec ou sans le concours des   id  ées de Darwin, sans quoi les particules atomiques dont nous sommes constitués n’auraient ni commencement ni fin, ce qui est tout à fait irrationnel.

2,"here's how Google translated it, but it's very understandable, and I couldn't agree more, Sam!  Having also tasted the intense pain of rejection, the frustration that comes from the last two moves me comments at the highest point, however, the substantive issue is not to deny homosexuals the right to respect and filial love the common to all humans, but what is the nature of moral sexual behavior they adopt. In this chapter, unless a   legal   hole, there is one judge who is heard, a single reference that is credible God. Regardless of my sexual attraction of departure, I assure you that I align, or reform, on what God tells me, the human opinions contrary have no value to me face to hers. But God exists, with or without the help of id ées Darwin, otherwise the atomic particles that we have made no beginning or end, which is quite irrational. And since God exists and is ultimately responsible for our existence, it is necessary that we have spoken to in terms that are understandable, since the first being having received from him the ability to reflect on the origin of its existence. In this regard, the Judeo-Christian scriptures have no serious competitor. This is not a question of lack of respect for human rights, but   law   enforcement Divine"
1,"There's not really a specific   gay     gene  , but there are links. First of all, the gene for fay men is usually passed down through the mother. Mothers who have gay uncles or cousins are more likely to have a gay child. The more sons a mother has, the more likely another son is to be gay. This has to do with an immune system response. Prenatal hormones also have a huge effect. If a girl   baby   has abnormal levels of testosterone in her blood, she will be more likely to be gay. So... There's not necessarily a gay gene, it's more of an environmental thing. People are still born gay, however, and they don't have a choice in the matter.

But still, it is a personal decision between spouses, and children have survived the divorce of their parents for millennia.But when that person begins attempting to convince others, especially those who are already psychologically vulnerable from a childhood of indoctrination in self-hatred, to do something as psychologically damaging as denying their own natural sexual orientation and trying to force themselves to be the opposite, or using emotional coercion to try to compel them into a lifetime of celibacy for which they are not emotionally suited, I have a problem with it.  And when that person forms an organization which demonstrates a devotion to disseminating false information (pseudo-science) about others with a view towards interfering with their basic civil and human rights, and towards trying to sway public opinion to further persecute that group of people, yeah, that really gets my blood boiling.So, if Mr. Chambers wants to marry and have kids, that's his business.  Chances are pretty good that he is actually bisexual.  But he need not go about insisting that everyone is like himself and that if they do not conform to his personal choices, they deserve fewer rights than he does.  "
2,"I find very interesting the concept that a person is defined by how they ""feel.""  There exists an entire field in psychology, known as cognitive therapy or cognitive behavorial therapy, started by Aaron Beck, which works on the presumption that how you ""feel"" is not immutable.  Once upon a time, one of the marks of a ""civilized"" person that distinquished us from animals was our ability to control our emotions, and not simply act on instinct. Now we are reduced to ""if it feels good, do it.""  As a society, how do we draw a line between not requiring a man who feels gay from going against his natural emotions and inclinations, and not requiring a man who feels very angry going against his natural emotions and inclinations?

1,"To Setfree,The only issue I would have with your well reasoned arguments is that all of the evidence listed comes from the same book, a book which has a definate bias from the outset. Fair enough, if the stats prove correct it doesn't matter what the authors bias is, the quoted statistics are somewhat unambiguous. I would be very surprised if they held up to the scrutiny of a statician. I have looked around the internet briefly for the studies he quotes in his bibliography and found that one survey (Linn et al 1989) was entitled ""Recent sexual behaviors among homosexual men seeking primary medical care"" and was a study of knowledge of AIDS, HIV and safe sex practises in people who are suspected of infection. (ie why they were vulnerable to it).Another; (seage et al 1992) was a study of patients at AIDS-related clinics and their sexual partners. If the entire sample field is questioned in an STD clinic or doctors surgery, is it maybe conceivable that a large proportion would have STD's? Why else would they be there in the first place? Does he compare this sample to heterosexuals at STD clinics? I imagine he would find promiscuity artificially high, STD rate equally high and probably recreational drug and alcohol use also high.You did however say that there is more sure data so if you'd let us know what it is I'd love to have a look."

Bottom line is, it doesn't matter how untrue what it is they're saying, they will say it anyway and believe nothing else. that's the issue that needs to be addressed. The issues spawns from the socialist elite's Anti-  christian   crusade. scientists are paid to by lobbyists for the liberate the gays crusade.  If you read these reports, one after the other is aimed at confusing and convinceing lay people that there is evidence when there is not. That's the issue that needs addressing, because we have a force looking to deceive people. None of those people have a possitive value in the world. They are the drones of the nazi party. They are brain dead socialist anti-christian army. Truth and logic is not a object to them, only their voracious ego is of substance and their ego supports the Godless elite.   gay   people will regularly talk about thier sexual fasinations.. there's never a time for them not to.they are a lavishish sexually decadent people. if a pedophile were to be the same way, people might say, hey, this is an immoral person.  but the liberal has a false formula in their head. it says 'gay people can never be immoral'.  that's not true at all. These liberals are such shit. you can have  gay person at a childs birthday party discussing how but sexs is fantabulous, and suddenly that's the new moral standard. The sceince has always understood the sexual mind to be based on experience. let's say, nurture and nature. Gay do not fight for equal rights, they fight for especial rights. they're allowed to marry, but they want to   redefine marriage  . Imagine 2 brothers, how want to get 'married', not to have sex or raise a child, but to save   money  . that's not complicated and so much effort has been put forth, but they can't even understand the basic tenets of their argument. thos two brother have the right to get married. but they don't have a right to redefine marriage. that's just a hall mark on the irrational nature of these people. and the fact that they're still here with this faulted contest just shows we have no system of sanity or truth. IT's the elite promoting this idea. sense can't even topple it. It's a faulted idea supported by a mindless near majority. (these controlers are getting old, they want to to get their twists in while they can.' IT is an anti=religious crusade and it's a sexual liberating crusade. They want child sex slaves.. one step at a time. They have and use them already.. they just want   society   to accept the fact. That's what the obscenely wealthy godless people do. fuck you gays, you';re a bunch of freaks. i do have the right to say that, as much as the powerful elite wish to squash it."

WHERE is this ""homosexual chromosome""? The entire idea of a ""Gay Gene"" is the most wretchedly absurd thing I've ever encountered or even heard of in my entire life.  You genes only understand replication -- pure, straight-forward reproductive replication.  That's the purpose of our genes.  Our genes, our most rudimentary architect are designed to keep us alive and replicate themselves.  From an evolutionary point of view (which is the ONLY POV that your genes ""know"" homo-sexuality.  There's no possible way anyone's genes could EVER know   homosexuality   simply because that defies their very intention and nature (that of surviving and replicating).  So what does cause the sensation of homosexuality or the illusion of homosexuality in people?  Lower female sexual arousal.  Socetial, familial, social, historical incidents that caused a person to associate arousal and sex and attraction on a superficial level to the same sex.  But all of those are just superficial mental confusions or temporary experimentations.  Deep down (to our genes) we're all heterosexual.  Saying that people are gay genetically is like saying ""Well, some cars are meant to just jiggle in place and not move."" The purpose of a car is to provide transportation, just like the purpose of genes is to provide life and replicate.  If a certain contraption doesn't move forward or a bit of cellular   technology   doesn't create survival and replicate, you can't call those respectively, a car or genetic material.Now the arguments of the church are ABSURD.  IF (and this is a strong IF because we know from above genetic evidence that this is not true)  there was some way that someone could be genetically born to be gay, and this is purely hypothetical because we know what not to be true, but hypothetically if someone were genetically gay then outlawing a genetically-defined state would be absolutely absurd and akin to saying to people that they had to collect their sweat and consume it after perspiring."
2,"My argument is clear.  You're arguing the messenger.  My point has been made.   On the contrary, my knowledge suffices.Yeah ""influences in   pregnancy  "" include birth defects and deformities"".

That's like saying ""when a care is made in a factory, occasionally when it comes out on the conveyor belt, sometimes some ""influence"" happens that causes it to only go in reverse"".As homo sapiens, we're designed to reproduce.  Tendencies to not do that (  homosexuality  ) are not just counter-productive, but they're anatomically-biologically-productive (i.e. nonexistent) .  Behavior traits are NOT so much determined by genes.  It's anatomical traits such as pigment that are gene-based.

Just like certain people Look down others because there gay, people look down on others because the have genetic disorders that can't be helped. So to say that genetics doesn't dictate your life is completely wrong. Even If you were right about being able to  control what your sexual orientation is, A strait man will never be happy if he's in a relationship with a gay man, and a gay man will never be happy in a relationship with a women.

1,"Are people born gay?  Why would anyone in their right mind get in a detailed argument over intricacies of genetic   science   with a group of people who are still ideologically conflicted about the basic facts of   evolution  ? The essential question here is whether or not human beings have the right to define themselves, according to their own perceptions of themselves.  I assert that we each have that right.Does anyone really think that someone would just wake-up one fine morning and decide to change their sexual orientation to be someone who attracts bigotry almost anywhere in the world.  Being gay or lesbian attracts anger of the morally rigid and the sexually-uncertain everywhere.  Sure there are few people are wired that way, who would choose to side with the under-dog and to be with the outcast. There were a few brave souls who so identified with the plight of Jews. that they wore the yellow star even though they themselves were not genetically Jewish. One of those brave souls was the King of Denmark.  A few white people in apartheid infected South Africa made that choice, but not many.I'd say the odds are way high against gayness being a decision and much higher for it being a genetic predetermination. But, in the larger picture, why does is matter? If a person is gay or chooses to be gay what business is it of anyones?  Why do you care if I am gay or straight or bi or if I had some surgery to look like what you think I'm supposed to be?  Everyone agrees that love is blind. What if it's just a matter of who you fall in love with?  I am almost 65 I I still don't understand why people choose to be in one   religion   or another then assume that they have the right to force-fit everyone into their religious template.  A person's religion is definitely not genetically determined. It is easily, or at least readily, changed. People change their minds about religion all the time. Why should   society  's rules be made to comport with anything as fungible as religion?There are myriad arguments against the fundamental human right to be human.  There is only one argument for it. That it is right."

2,"As this article points out, one cannot reduce the intricacy of our physiological makeup such that we assume social constructs are defined so completely by our genes. Despite various research studies, with findings such as heightened serotonin metabolism in exclusively homosexual males, sexuality is at best a social construct haphazardly linked to one's sense of self and concept of body.Throughout human history, society has undergone such perversions from the natural that the act of copulation has been pathologised to such an extent that most people consider the resulting neuroses a physical drive. If we take a psychoanalytic view of socialisation, we will see that 'sexuality' is constructed and not inherited. From birth, it is drilled into us that the erogenous zones are to be repressed and hidden, this causes an unnatural psychological reaction, resulting in a neurotic fixation with copulation, and genital organs. The repression that occurs is so great, that the manifestation is what we refer to as sexuality. The magnitide of the repression is directly proportional to the societal weight of this 'topic', as is obvious from media content. In nature, such a distortion of copulation does not exist.In conclusion, it is not a case of 'are people born gay?'. For homosexuality is simply a variation on the theme. It should not be pathologised to any greater extent than heterosexuality. "
1,"...there is no ""cancer gene."" There are a few genetic combinations that can put you at risk of cancer. But even if you live a low-risk lifestyle, you still might get cancer because of your genes. The greatest benefit to knowing a family history of cancer is not that you live trying to avoid cancer, but that you go in frequently for testing. This raises the odds that any cancer will be found early and treated. None of this harms the idea that there may also be unavoidable genetic factors to homosexuality.  Furthermore, all research shows that sexuality is fairly well solidified by the time a child is born; people come out at 18, they don't turn gay then. So the environmental factors that cause or effect homosexuality are likely prenatal or occur quite early in development. As to your claim that gays in ""reparative therapy"" treatment are unhappy with themselves and their gender, the gays I know that aren't in ""reparative therapy"" are happy with themselves and their gender. This is either self-selection, or something about the ""therapy."" Either way, it's not surprising. "

1,"To put this into a little more perspective: we study fruit flies for insights into human   autism  , and we have made breakthroughs through them. If the study had shown that some genes make some fruit flies kind of sort of showing a slight change in orientation at certain times in the day, no, this would not have any meaning. It doesn't. It shows a hardwired single gene. Of course it doesn't work exactly the same way; we don't lay eggs, for one, and we likely have a few recessive genes that activate or not depending on the environment instead of one specific gene. (Research points to there being a couple different ones, anyway, since genetic causes of male homosexuality already seem different from female.)If you're asking if this is the gene that controls detecting masculinity or femininity, and which one the fly is attracted to, that's the same thing in different words. And, again, it shows a lead. "

2,"Went I attended The Ohio State University it was going through a tranistion in it's Psychology department.  The 70's were a time of new ideas and conventions.Our Professors were being told to teach that homosexuality was not abnormal or a disorder.  But that didn't change the facts.In particular male homosexuality is still quite rare 1/2 to 1 % of the population is actively gay or homosexual.As for whether its is ""born"" or learned the answer lies somewhere inbetween.  Men and women are often born genetically inbetween male and female.  This is a known fact and in some cases infants even have both sets of genitalia.  Some men grow up with feminine behaviors, voices, and even build.This however doesn't predetermine their gender identity, because often parental and peer influence is so strong that these men fall into the role of the male parent and spouse. However, when young, they can be ostacized by alpha males, and drawn to homosexuals who might see them as an easy turn.Others are afffected by sexual trauma inflicted by a family member or peer, and othertimes imprinting behavior is missing in a family that is not functioning prooperly because of divorce or a parent accidentlly or deliberately confusing their role.  In affect, in both situations it is a learned behavior though in the latter case is dramatically affected by biologically conflicted gender identity.It is an unpopular stand to take to say that being gay is abnormal, but the fact that it is rare and is not selected for genetically and it can not reproduce itself genetically over time says that it is an abnomally.That said I believe that tolerance and love is called for, but not encouragement we are seeing in our society today.  We don't encourage deafness, blindness, or   autism  , though we also are not intolerant of their condition.  Then too we will strive to imprive their situation if a ""cure"" presents itself.  Note that the deaf community is staarting to push back against curing deafness, because they see it as a threat to the normalcy of their community."
1,"SuperDelegate says ""fact that it is rare and is not selected for genetically and it can not reproduce itself genetically over time says that it is an abnomally."".By this logic ants, bees and similar colony based societal insects would have long ago died out as most of the populaiton there is asexual. Consider that every single asexual worker ant you see has had an unbroken chain of reproducing ancestors for hundreds of years. Every single one is the offspring of a queen and a mate, yet lives its life without ever having sex. How is that selected for?Some studies suggest that you're more likely to be gay if you have more older brothers. (   http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13555604  / ). This would suggest that your mother carries the genes to make you a gay man. How does she benefit genetically? Consider you have four reproducing brothers, each one impregnates a seperate girl who takes nine months to come to term. Who are you going to impregnate? Better for the family if, like ants, you assist in maintaining your nieces and nephews health until breeding age rather than fruitlessly competing with your siblings.Given the fruit fly studies I would not be surprised if there is a gay gene, however I would also not be surprised if this is an issue of hormonal balance in gestation. I would also believe that in some instances gayness can be environmental. It really doesn't matter one way or another to me but I do believe that at least some, probably most, gays are born homosexual (for valid biological reasons) and should be allowed to live their life however they please. From a purely selfish viewpoint, more gay men means more choice of partner for me and less competition for them. In fact I may start a campaign of straight men for gays! (except lesbians, sorry but that doesn't help me at all does it?!) Joking aside I have phrased this argument with the gay being a man but it is equally as valid for the ladies."
2,"I'm sure that my lack of unprovable statistics and supportive scripture will make it easy for my contribution to this discussion to be scoffed at. However, I have been reading every one's insight from top of this page to the bottom, regarding whether or not people choose to be gay and I just had to   add   my two cents, for what it's worth.  My brother, Michael was a year and a half younger than me. But we were best friends. We did everything together. From the time he was about five I remember people in my family making comments about how  Michael was going to be gay when he grew up. At 5, people could tell. He didn't even know what   sex   or being gay even meant.  To make a long story short, I came home from   school   one day. Michael had stayed home sick. My parents were at work. I walked into the room that we shared together and found my brother, my best friend, hanging from the rafter. He was only 13 and he committed   suicide  . The reason? Well the note he had left on his pillow, which was very obviously stained in his tears, said, and I quote ""I just cant take this life anymore. I have been trying to pretend that I was not gay since I first knew what gay meant. I've tried for years, but I am. Everyone knows it. I hate it. Im afraid people will beat me up or worse. Every morning i cry in the shower knowing I have to go to school again and spend my day being laughed at by girls and insulted by the guys. I wished to God not to be gay.  But God didn't answer. For the few people in my life who know Im gay and still arent disgusted by me, Im sorry if I hurt you. But it hurts too much and gay boys are weaklings. Im 13 and every second of my life is consumed by feelings of guilt, shame, fear, and disgust for myself. The average life span is somewhere in the 70's. That thought of knowing I may have another 60 years of this was just more than I could bare. Mom, dad, and Caleb (that's me) I love you guys and I don't want you guys to have to explain to people that you are related to a fag. I should have done this sooner for you guys..I love you.  Michael.""  That was my brothers complete suicide letter. Does this sound like a person who made a choice to be gay? You could tell from 5 and he was sorry that we his family had to be related to a fag. Debates like this one will go on forever. As for me, you can lay all the studies, statistics, polls, and arguments in the world in front of me. But my brother's very short life is all the proof I need to know that people absolutely have no choice whether to be gay or straight. And 1 more small thought I'd like to put out there. What about child molesters? If being gay is a choice, is being a pedophile a choice too?"

1,"It is called life, and in life there are no guarantees. Homosexuality is empirically a perversion, and doubtfully would one chose perversion.

To debate it is futile and only exercises one's frustrations."
1,"I'm sorry that Rick Brentlinger has chosen to reject an important aspect of his own humanity (his sexual orientation) because of what it says in a dusty old book.  There is no way to argue this point rationally, because ""sin"" is a completely non-objective term based on no evidence whatsoever except what it says in the bible.  If you believe that the bible is god's literal word (also in the absence of objective evidence, and in contradiction to much objective evidence) then nothing anyone says will convince you otherwise.  That's the nature of faith; that's its immune from reason, exists in its own isolated world, and cannot be touched by rational debate or discussion.  But if the bible is the literal work of god, I wonder what believers think about the two examples below. There are many others. Should we take them literally?  Leviticus 20:10""If a man commits adultery with another man's wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.""Exodus 22:3""A thief must certainly make restitution, but if he has nothing, he must be sold to pay for his theft."
2,"You're not precise when you say sin is isolated from a rational world. Authors like CS Lewis in ""Mere Christianity"" have argued how there is a moral law that trascends religions. If you're interested you can check out that book. Also your quotes are out of the context (bible has to be analised literally, symbolically and historically). If you analize New Testament the circumstance may continue as a sin, but Jesus payed for those sins."
1,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""Authors like CS Lewis in ""Mere Christianity"" have argued how there is a moral law that trascends religions"".  To me religious moral laws already inappropriately ""transcend"" the secular human realm.  I haven't read the book you mention, but what can possibly transcend the law of god as interpreted by those charged to do so?  In any case, my major concern is that the source of religious moral laws (in this case, the law against homosexuality) is god and not man.  Proper moral law must be based on the nature of humans, not on the nature of god.  ""Do what god says"" is not a moral law, because it does not ask what behaviors are good or bad for people AS people.  It simplistically says that being good consists of obeying the rules (as defined by the bible).  By this improper ""moral law"" homosexuality is a sin because, as I said, it violates the arbitrary law set down in a dusty old book.  In contrast ""Live and let live"" (for example) IS a proper moral law because it respects the nature of humans as individual moral beings with independent minds who live and relate to one another through mutual recognition, respect, and consent.  By this proper moral law homosexuality is NOT a ""sin"" because it does not violate the rights or fundamental humanity of anyone else.  You also say the ""...bible has to be analised literally, symbolically and historically"".  This is a contradiction.  It can be taken literally or NOT literally.  It either IS the literal word of god, or its open to interpretation.  If it IS the literal word of god, then you cannot re-interpret any part of it to your liking.  And if its NOT the literal word of god, then it is not the authoritative law for human behavior or anything else, for that matter.  It is hypocrisy to take parts of the bible literally while ""interpreting"" other parts.  And once you ""interpret"" it, either symbolically or historically or in any other way, you have put your judgement (or the judgement of other humans) above the word of god.  "
1,"I really want to know what ""Law"" was passed down since the 10 Commandments? I will not dispute Moses account, but there were no other witnesses. Not a single commandment about homosexuals.Seems a sin of omission on Gods part? Even the churches and religious organizations, dispute any contemporary claims for ""hearing"" from God.Those people you claim are ""charged"" to do so, are none the less just other people. They are all there because they choose to be. No more than you or me to interpret anything. God has also seen fit not to drop a list of people from heaven, charging anyone to do anything.Like any corporation, the religious organizations all get some good people and some bad people. Like any good employee they also protect their jobs. Where you get this fantasy about God and people is well beyond any sane comprehension. If it werwe a bad thing, God would not have allowed animals to ""suffer"" the same malady.I once knew a farmer. He had a prize bull that was a flaming homosexual.

(Leviticus 18:22, NIV)"" 'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."" (Leviticus 20:13)You compare the act of animals to the acts of humans.  Animals indulges in all kinds of beastly behavior but to compare this to human homosexuality is actually out of place.  For one humans are created above animals and we know right from wrong in a general sense which animals cannot.  Furthermore animals have know self identity and are entirely incapable of rational thought, a bull cannot think itself homosexual anymore then it can think itself a bull, it just is a bull.  Animals have instincts that they act on and when taken out of nature, eg. a farm, they are more inclined to all kinds of more unnatural behaviors including apparently homosexual acts.Peace,Spencer  "

2,"     Lets first start with a working and shared definintion of ""rational."" Rational: ""Having or exercising the ability to reason.  Consistent with or based on reason; logical: rational behavior."" (American Heritage Dictionary)     You ask where I am getting my info; where are you getting yours?  There is some controversy as to whether   animals   are capable of rational throught, however, the vast majority of people including scientists do accept an animal as a rational creature.  For example, recently there was a women in CA who had a   pet   chimp.  Without warning and without rational basis the chimp went ""ape"" on her girl friend and almost killed her.  Professionals in the field, including zoologists, vets, other biologits etc. often reference that these types of things happen because they are ""wild animals.""  To expect rational behavior from an animal is absurd.       Furthermore, from a Biblical point of view, regardless of how literaly one interpreates the   creation   accounts there is a clear distinction between man and the animals.  Namely they alone were made in the image and likeness of God, recieved from a him a rational that is in likeness to him (which animals do not) and were given dominion over the earth (including the animal kingdomm).       Philosophically we can know that animals are not capable of considering sylogistic reasoning, understand logic.  A dog does not think about where it would go to   college   or what it wants to do with its life.  The earliest philosophers and through the present age have noticed a distinction from animals and humankind.  To argue that because an animal does something means it is ok for humans is ludicrist.  Animals eat there own kind, commit acts of aggression including   murder   and many other atrocious behavior if we tried to understand this rationaly.   However, we know that they are animals and they do that kind of thing based on instict and conditioning.  Yes Leviticus is Old Testements.  Leviticus is not just a rule book for Hebrew males it was given to the whole people of Israel as with the rest of the Torah.  No I am not ethnically Hebrew alhtough I do consider myself a ""child of Abraham"" through the promise, i.e. by   faith  .  Shalom,Spencer"
2,"     The late Pope John Paul II was noted for quoting often the phrase ""Christ...fully reveals man to himself.""  from ""Gaudium et Spes.""  In the Christian tradition God and his commands are not ""up there"" far away in some Platonic other but right here, now in the present among us.  God came to Abram, his glory dwelt on Mt. Sinai with Moses, John the Baptist preached ""the Kingdom of God is at hand,"" Jesus, ""it is among us"" and Jesus the Christ himself is the incarnation of God.  God's Word came present not ""up there"" but in time, in history, in the lives and languages of a real culture of and society amongst real individuals.       Universal moral law is only true in so much as it is indeed universal and based in the common good.  Not the good of an individual or a group but as it is the good for all.  In order for this to be so it must somehow exist ontologically in its own right, objectively and not in the will of man for the will of man is not only corrupt but subjective.  In this case the only moral law that can actually be true and universal is that law which is given from God.  Any other attempt for man to construct there own law, there own morals, there own understanding of right and wrong, good and evil is in fact from the evil one.  To do so would nuance the falsity that we are god, or anyway like God.  (see Genesis 3).  Rather God calls us into relationship with him not only because it is the good for us to do but because it is the purpose for which we are created.  God not only calls us to himself as an action of doing but as an action of being because it is who we are, after all God calls us into being.       How is it reconciled then, that we as humans need a morality that is actually attainable that isn't beyond our reach  that is as you said ""for people.""  God knows that his law is to high for people to achieve (see Romans 7).  This is precisely why he came not as other but as man and in doing so made the way for man to experience not only holiness and righteousness (as accorded by his law) but true peace with God and right relationship with him.  Jesus' humanity is evidence that it is possible and he is the way to our eternal Father, our divine Creator.  Jesus affords the way we must choose weather one will take that, accept God's offer of freedom and redemption or continue to neglect him and his holiness by living in sin.  Societies likewise, can compromise the truth and go on living ""as every man sees fit"" with the illusion of justice by ""living and letting live."" But dies this ""live and let live"" really provide true justice?  What about the injustice of psychological distress within a man, is this accounted for? Not because ""live and let live"" only accounts for interpersonal relationship not the inner justice of man.  Or how about acts of ""so called freedom"" that actually bring further bondage?  Are they ok if only consent is given?  Prostitution, fornication, drunkenness, consumerism?  All of these things go on under the guise of false justice, ie. live and let live, but in reality they continue to demean the integrity and intrinsic value of the human person.  The justice based in the reality that all men are created  equal is the justice of God for he has endowed men with such unalienable rights as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Each human person, all men, all women, those who believe they are homosexual and those who do not, those born, those unborn, those dying they are all worth so much to God that he he gave his only begotten son to die that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting, full, life.  Christ speaks the freeing word, the word of liberty over all those who call on his name as they become who they truly are before sin and bondage and oppression came to foul our fallen race.  Jesus saves.  Jesus calls us to our original purpose, he is the fulfillment of our happiness.  True morality and justice accounts to the full truth of the human being and human experiance accroding to him who knows all things and all things about us, according to him who walked among us and made a way for real people, and who calls us into realtionship with him and gives us to the power to live holy, lives of right action and right being by putting His Spirit in those who believe in him.  This Spirit is the Lord the giver of life, who reigns with the Father and the Son, One God overall, for all, in love with all.  including you friend,Peace,Spencer"
1,"SidAirfoil, If you REALLY believe the   bible   is ""God's Word"" not man's and as you say ""In any case, my major concern is that the source of religious moral laws (in this case,   the law   against   homosexuality  ) is   god   and not man"",  then I challenge you to explore all of the scripture that I have assembled at http://WhatkindofGod.org/ and swear on the bible that you believe all of the horrible statements attributed to ""God"" in the bible! including for example:    ""No one born of a forbidden   marriage   (no ""bastard"") nor any offspring from such a marriage may enter the assembly of the LORD, not even in the tenth generation.""         If Deuteronomy 23:2 is taken seriously (which Conservatives must do, if they take the scriptures as seriously as they claim) , then these are the inevitable consequences :Not only are all the ""bastard""   children   of the faithful to be unjustly punished (for something they had no power over), but all of the following as well:all of their children, (2nd generation)their grand-children, (3rd generation)their great-grand-children, (4th generation)their great-great-grand-children, (5th generation)their great-great-great-grand-children,their great-great-great-great-grand-children,their great-great-great-great-great-grand-children,their great-great-great-great-great-great-grand-children,their great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grand-children as well,(which could number into the hundreds if not thousands of offspring).         This also has serious ramifications going BACKWARDS, i.e. ,Can you be absolutely sure that you yourself aren't a bastard?How can you be sure that neither of your two parents was?What about your 4 grand-parents?What about your 8 great-grand-parents?etc.,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.,  "
2,"""Don't ask don't tell"" does not actively pursue gays. Letter from the American Center for Military Readiness. March 3, 2009 - ""Don't ask don't tell was formulated in response to President Clinton's direction to the secretary of defense to find a way to enable homosexuals who wish to serve to do so. The policy removed the question: 'are you homosexual?' from the uniformed services enlistment application form ('don't ask'); asserted that open admission of homosexuality or homosexual conduct were a basis for discharge ('don't tell'); and charged military leaders not to pursue suspected homosexuals without clear evidence of conduct or open admissions."" 
"
1,"I agree with SidAirfoil, that the bible is filled with immoral acts that are no longer considered immoral. They were made by man and they have been changed by man. But the passages of the Bible that deserve the most question include Genesis itself, within the chapter on Sodom and Gomorrah. When two male angels come to Lot's house the night before God is to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot protects them from the (homosexual male) crowd by what moral act? By offering up his two virgin daughters so that the crowd will leave his honored guests alone. And if that were not enough morality with which we would ALL DISAGREE, and see as reprehensible child abandonment or worse...the chapter ends with both of Lot's daughters getting him drunk so they can have incestuous sex with him.So our source of morality has homosexuality as sinful, but child endangerment as virtuous, and incest as perfectly okay.The Bible is a very weak source of morality. What else do you have to show that homosexuality is ""immoral?"" What harm is it to ""moral""people, if otherwise moral homosexuals do their own thing in private?"
2," You should take them literally, because that's how it used to be back then, now those laws don't apply because of Jesus' death on the cross . Leviticus 20:10 and Exodus 22:3 talks about laws from the old testament. Because of Jesus' death on the cross, we can say that these laws don't have an effect on us. "
1,"I'm confused.  Jesus died for our sins, so now adultery and theft aren't sins anymore?  Or if they are still sins, they require less severe punishment today than in the past because Jesus paid-it-forward for us?  Either I'm missing an important theological point, or this is just a rationalization to reject the literal word of god (the bible) in favor of modern, humanistic moral standards. "
2,"It's not saying they aren't since anymore, but sin is not dealt in the same way as in the old testament. This doesn't mean that the condition of sin is lightened, it is the same, but Jesus sacrifice plays a huge role when it comes to forgiveness. Now because of Jesus we can be saved, we are able to be forgiven and called righteous as long as we repent from our sins (meaning turning away from our sinful nature) and chose to live for Jesus. Isaiah 53 talks about Jesus death on the cross. These are just parts of it.5 But he was pierced for our rebellion,      crushed for our sins.   He was beaten so we could be whole.      He was whipped so we could be healed. 6 All of us, like sheep, have strayed away.      We have left God’s paths to follow our own.   Yet the Lord laid on him      the sins of us all. This part talks about How He became an offering for sin on the cross. 10 But it was the Lord’s good plan to crush him      and cause him grief.   Yet when his life is made an offering for sin,      he will have many descendants.   He will enjoy a long life,      and the Lord’s good plan will prosper in his hands. 11 When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish,      he will be satisfied.   And because of his experience,      my righteous servant will make it possible   for many to be counted righteous,      for he will bear all their sins.Notice how it talks about many because not everyone will turn to Jesus for salvation.So just to make sure I answer your questions1) Adultery, theft as well as homosexuality and other sins are still sins. And I believe they aren't any less of sins. 2) Basically the there is judgement, however Jesus did pay for our sins so repentance plays a huge role. He can take away judgement from us if we turn away from our ways and surrender to Him. "
1,"The idea is that Jesus in His life, death and resurrection, fulfilled all the demands of the Law, therefore we are not required to keep the Law ourselves to be right with God.That is not a license to sin. It simply acknowledges that ""all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags."" To get saved and to go to heaven, we need the righteousness of Christ.""Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation THROUGH FAITH IN HIS BLOOD, to declare HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;To declare, I say, at this time, HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS..."" - Romans 3:25""But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and RIGHTEOUSNESS, and sanctification, and redemption."" - I Corinthians 1:30    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Christians-Under-Law.html    "
1,"Thanks for the reply, Rick.You said ""The idea is that Jesus in His life, death and resurrection, fulfilled all the demands of the Law, therefore we are not required to keep the Law ourselves to be right with God.""In other words, Jesus died not only so that we could be forgiven for all the sins committed BEFORE he died, but also so that we had a path to be forgiven for the one's committed AFTER his death (i.e. today).  Right?  But forgiveness still requires not only that we repent, but also that we accept Jesus as the only path to penitence.  And that's the part I don't like.  It's off the current topic, but to me forgiveness has to come only from the person I've wronged, and not from Jesus or god, or any other supernatural being.  That's because my secular morality is based on respect for HUMANS, not respect for god.  To me it's offensive that  hurting another person is considered ""sinful"" because it violates the law of god, rather than because it violates of rights of a person.  It's offensive that repentant murderers ask for god's forgiveness, rather than the forgiveness of their victims and their families, and find peace through god without regard to the person they've killed.  But all this is for another discussion.  Since homosexuality hurts no PERSON, it is not immoral, although I acknowledge that it is ""sinful"" according to your arbitrary religious dogma.  Sid"
1,"Sid-You make a very good point about forgiveness being multi-faceted.Just to be clear, I do NOT believe it is a sin to be homosexual or lesbian. Further, I do NOT believe it is a sin to be in a committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnership. As human beings, we need forgiveness from God - that forgiveness is available because Jesus' blood paid our sin debt (past, present and future sins) and because Jesus' physical resurrection demonstrated that God the Father has accepted Jesus' payment for our sins.But your point is absolutely valid, that we should also seek forgiveness for wronging someone and they should seek forgiveness for wronging us. That is the human side of forgiveness.I agree with you that homosexuality in general hurts no PERSON.Rick    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Moses-Law.html    "
1,"Rick said ""But your point is absolutely valid, that we should also seek forgiveness for wronging someone and they should seek forgiveness for wronging us. That is the human side of forgiveness.""  I'm glad to hear that.  It just seems to me that the forgiveness of one's victim much too often takes a distant back seat to the forgiveness of god.  And that is consistent with my morality having a different source (respect for human rights) than religious morality (obedience to god's law).  Also you said ""Just to be clear, I do NOT believe it is a sin to be homosexual or lesbian. Further, I do NOT believe it is a sin to be in a committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnership. ""I realize that.  Sorry if I didn't make that clear.  I think you're on the right side of this debate (overall!).  But I do have a point to make and a question to ask you or anyone else who is reading this.  I have met many Christians who also say that they do not think BEING gay is a sin, only that ACTING gay is a sin.  This presumably acknowledges (correctly) that sexual orientation is NOT a choice people make.  You're either gay or you're straight.  And just as I did not choose to be straight, homosexuals don't choose to be gay.  Sexual orientation is simply one aspect of yourself that you discover as you mature.  This is another reason why I don't believe that BEING gay is immoral.  Where there is no choice morality does not attach.  Being gay (or straight) is neither moral not immoral.  Sexual orientation, like height or hair color, is simply not a moral issue.  This being said, regardless of your orientation, whom you have sex with and what kind of sex you have ARE choices that we make.  And so my question is; Is it reasonable for a Christian to accept that a person IS homosexual, while condemning them for ACTING in a homosexual fashion?  Obviously I don't think it is reasonable.  But I'd like to hear from anyone who does, since this is not an uncommon attitude in my experience.  Sid"
1,"The Bible claims to be the word of God. Thousands of times we read, ""Thus saith the LORD"" or ""The word of the LORD came unto him, saying...""Exodus 31:18 and 32:15-16, Deuteronomy 4:13, 5:22, 9:10-11 are crystal clear that God did indeed write some of the Bible - the Ten Commandments - with His own finger, with His own hand."
1,"According to the bible, God wrote the commandments on stone tablets with his own hand yet the  bible was printed on paper.  The Ten Commandments were written thousands of years before the bible was written.  That answers that question.Many people believe the bible should be taken literally. Please then explain the following:In Numbers 31:1-18, God commands Moses to kill all the adult male Midianites and kidnap all the women and children.  The the Lord commanded Moses to kill all the male children and kill all the non-virgin females. Moses then said that the remaining female children could be taken as sexual slaves.And people think Islam is a religion of violence?  So, explain this passage but here is the catch: you cannot say every word in the bible must be taken literally but then write off passages like this as ""parables"" meant to teach us some other lesson.I will never try to tell someone that there is or isn't a God or tell them what to believe, that is a personal choice and I respect those who make that choice. But why not respect others for making their own choices? When one sect of Christianity tells me that members of other Christian sects cannot enter heaven, it is clear that many Christians do not espouse the principles of their own faith.  When one sees a person treat their fellow humans like dirt six days a week but go to church on Sunday and have a ""What Would Jesus Do"" license plate frame, I have nothing but disgust.And do not forget that the text of the ten commandments are also found, almost word for word, in the Qur'an. (""or come nigh to adultery: for it is a shameful"" 017:032)And further more, the first five books of the old testament of the bible is also known as the Torrah from Judaism, written well before the bible.I think like Sid, I treat people as a result of human rights, not because of God's promise of heaven because the wrong motivation is a factor. If you are good to people only so you can go to heaven then you really are doing it for you, not your fellow human being. "

1,"Crash makes an interesting point.What did Jesus say about all of this?Many non-gay and gay people insist Jesus never addressed the issue of homosexuality. I believe Jesus did address the gay issue when He pointed out in Matthew 19:3-12 that all men cannot receive His teaching about Adam and Eve style marriage.Jesus taught that ""born eunuchs"" were a separate group, distinct from eunuchs who had been castrated and distinct from eunuchs who voluntarily abstained from Adam and Eve style marriage in order to serve God without distraction.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Homosexual-Eunuchs.html   Because Jesus intentionally differentiated between born eunuchs and metaphysical eunuchs who voluntarily decide not to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage, it makes sense to conclude that born eunuchs are:a. not required to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage (since Jesus intentionally opts them out)b. not required to abstain from marrying an orientation compatible partner (since Jesus intentionally differentiates them from metaphysical eunuchs who make a personal decision not to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage).   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Eunuchs-Are-Gay.html   "

1,"Pliskin (Snake?), Of course you're right that sex is a personal matter that is no one else's concern because it harms no one else.  ""Live and let live"" is a pretty good basis for morality, in my view, precisely because its basis is respect for other humans,and not obedience to god's law.  Clearly theists don't see it that way.  To them ""good"" is doing what god says, ""evil"" is not doing what god says.  How an act affects (or doesn't affect) other people is irrelevant to them.  ""Live and let live"" is NOT the basis of religionist morality.  I believe that most people choose religionist morality 1) because it requires less thought, responsibility and effort to do what your told than it does to decide right and wrong for yourself, and to live with the consequences, and 2) because it can be used to justify personal prejudices (i.e. homophobia) and give them divine support.  Hence people cite bible passages that support their views, while ignoring (or ""interpreting"" others that don't.  Often, people don't form beliefs because of what the bible says, they interpret the bible to support their preconceived beliefs.

1,"Ha!  You have figured out my cheesy 70's movie nickname.  What a great post and I agree with you 110% but I am going to add a couple of things.  Hypothetically speaking, what if homosexuality IS evil? So what? I don't believe that myself but if you do, how does it really affect you? (not you Sid)My personal opinion is that so many things like this, both religious in nature and not, is really fueled by fear of the unknown and a lack of confidence.For example, if you are strong in your Christian faith, what do you have to lose by gaining a better understating of Islam or Buddhism?  I have traveled extensively all over the world and with each journey, I gain a greater understanding of the world and it's people but traveling abroad only enhances my love for my country.  It doesn't make me want to move there.I believe there is fear behind homophobia for most people. If you are secure in who you are, what does it matter? Fear may be the most crippling disease in the world: fear of homosexuals, fear of other cultures, fear of other races, fear of other religions and most of all, fear of change.  Fear robs people of the most wonderful parts of the human experience."

It is the opposite of respect, sympathy and solidarity.But on the question of gay sex. It is real simple, if you are a religious person, most likely your religion speaks against sin and cherry picking passages from ancient texts won't change that. Since I am non religious and don't have to worry about ""sins"" I can base my moral decisions on the questions and values I have about respect, sympathy and solidarity. In that sense, homosexuals are just like heterosexuals they feel love, attraction, loneliness, despair of rejection and all the other things that come with passion and love, whether good or bad.Do what your heart tells you to do in questions of love; did no one learn anything from Shakespeare?

1,"Mangueken,I'm glad we agree on the non-sinfulness of homosexuality. But you also said ""Live and let live is hardly a good basis for morality. It pops up in the people who walk by and ignore one person physically hurting another person. "".  I disagree.  ""Live and Let Live"" does not preclude stopping one person from hurting another.  There is no moral law that says one must tolerate gross immorality.  ""Live and Let Live"" is a universal principle, not just my personal one.  It applies not just to myself, but to other as well.  When I accept it as my principle, I acknowledge that EVERYONE has the right to ""Live"", as well as the responsibility to ""Let Live"".  If someone harms another without justification, then they violate the social contract and may be stopped/punished.  Granted, on an individual level, one is not morally REQUIRED to intervene (If one fears for one's own safety, for example), but one is morally PERMITTED to do so.  But on a social level, a civil society is both permitted and required to intervene.  It is for this reason that invading Iraq was a moral thing to do (although not handled particularly well).  But that's another topic.  I reiterate.  If everyone swore the following oath, we would need no other moral law.  ""Everyone has the right to do whatever they want.""  This oath demands that my rights be respected, and also demands that I respect the same rights of others.  In a free society nothing else is necessary.  To call homosexuality a sin, and to try and stop it, violates this simple idea. Sid"

1,"Periannath said: ""You assume that rational truth is objective, that spiritual truth is not..."" Yes I do.  Rational truth, as you call it, is based on sensory-perceptual evidence that can be observed, analyzed, discussed, and debated.  Those are things that the human mind is excellent at doing.  Rational moral truth is based on the observation that people are all basically the same, that they have the same fundamental physical, psychological, and spiritual needs (by ""spiritual"" I do NOT mean, religious or supernatural.  I merely mean needs that are not physical).  ""A rational ""Live-and-Let-Live"" morality is based on the observation that people thrive when left to do as they please as long as they don't harm anyone else.  Hence homosexuality is NOT immoral.  These observations can be made by anyone, and are clearly demonstrable whether we consider them on an individual level or on a societal level.  In contrast, Religious truth is based on faith (i.e. belief WITHOUT evidence).  I do think that people who believe that the bible is the literal word of god ARE irrational (at least in that one aspect of their lives).  One can only believe the literalness of the bible by ignoring the immense body of historical and scientific evidence that utterly contradicts that assertion.  It's not enough to believe something very strongly.  Your belief must be plausible, supported by the evidence, and not explicable by a simpler, more plausible explanation.  I would think that the existence of so many faiths in the world each claiming mutually contradictory moralities would give pause to theists who think that their particular moral biases are the ""right"" ones.  Do you think you were just lucky to be born into a Christian society while Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, etc., were unluckily born into the ""wrong"" ones? You ask ""How is rational truth objective when it is the product of human minds, which tend to be very subjective?""  Well, how is religious truth objective when it is ALSO the product of the human mind?  The fact that you deny that your beliefs are the product of human minds doesn't change the fact that they are.  The bible was written, rewritten, altered, edited, interpreted, reinterpreted by PEOPLE.  How many different versions of the Christian bible exist today?  Why were some gospels removed by the Council of Nicea? What about the 80% of the human race that don't believe in the new testament?  And I haven't even begun to list the myriad scientific proofs against literalism. The only way you can believe in the literalness of the bible in the face overwhelming evidence that it's not literally true is if you are willfully blind.  And I believe that willful blindness is irrational and dangerous.  Men of faith flew planes into skyscrapers on 9/11.  Faith scares me.  Lastly you ask ""What objective [evidence] exists to show that the Bible is not God's word? ""  I just barely started to list the evidence above.  There is much more.  But it doesn't matter.  You are the one making the claim that the bible is literally true.  The burden of proof is on you to prove it, not on me to disprove it. Given the thousands of different creation myths, moral systems and ""bibles"" that have existed since the beginning of the human race, it is incumbent upon you to prove that yours is fact while all others are/were fiction.  Of course, since your beliefs are faith-based not evidence-based, I'm not sure why you would even want to ""prove"" the validity of yours by presenting evidence.  Proving it with objective evidence, even if you could do so, would turn your faith into science.  Sorry to be so wordy.  But I'm as passionate about my beliefs as I assume you are about yours.  Sid"
2,"""'You assume that rational truth is objective, that spiritual truth is not...'  Yes I do.""You never came to respond to my critique; your concept that rational truth is objective and spiritual-religious truth is not and that thus rational truth is more correct is an assumption.  You even concur that it is subjective but respond not by defending its objectivity but continuing to reinforce the idea of the apparent subjectivity of spiritual truth.  In this case, for the purposes of argument, it can be said that both rational and spiritual truth are subjective and there is not basis to argue that rational truth is higher or more true because it also falls to the realm of subjectivity.  You cannot argue...1.) Rational objective and spiritual truth is subjective2.) Objective truth is higher than subjective truth3.) Rational truth is higher than spiritual truthwhen you concur that rational truth is not objective, the logic fails.  Essentially when you answer ""Yes I do"" assume, you are begging the question.  You are assuming the thing to which you are trying to prove.  Furthermore, you assume that human beings are excellent rational beings.  A capacity for rationality does not guarantee rational excellency.  In reality most people are irrational and base choices off of not what one would could call rational and logical reasoning but on emotive  persuasions and fanciful constructions that care less with the matter of fact, as is, and more with the matter of desire, what is wanted from their self.  The idea then, that people are primarily rational is also unfounded.  Following, leaving morality to the tending of human rational thought alone is foolish.  It lacks good sense and sound judgment.  It is of no coincidence that the founders of our nation invoked divine aid in much of the process of the framing of the constitution among a great many things.  Congress opens in prayer with purpose.  Even many of the central principles of American constitutional government are founded in Judeo-Christian principles because these principles were thought of as special revelation, truth give to man from God that is superior to any form of truth gained through rational thought.  Even the Enlightenment thought of Descartes only justified the veracity of sensory evidence from which rational thought can deduct from because God guarantees the truthfulness of certain perceptions.  Without this guarantee there is not trust that anything we perceive has any basis in actual, objective reality.  The wise choice is not to leave moral truth to the realm of human rational alone.  More on this but I have to go now.  Peace Sid,Spencer"
1,"Only people who believe in the Christian ""God"" are moral, is what you're saying....The Catholic church recognizes that homosexuality is not a sin... it is only a sin to act out the homosexuality...ness.  If you say you believe in ""God"", and then call what ""God"" made imperfect, don't you think that's defeating the purpose?  Who the crap are you to know better than ""God"" how a person is supposed to be made?  If that person was made by ""God"" then it was ""God"" who created that sinful cocktail mix of chemicals that dictates to that person whom he or she will be sexually attracted to.  That would make the act of ""God"" a sinful act...  which, if you believe in ""God""... you know can't happen.So, by you saying that homosexuality is a sin, you're completely destroying the very ""God"" you claim to believe in.  Which doesn't sound very reasonable to me.  Especially since you're the one who believes in him.Last, but not least,  that wasn't a case of ""begging the question"".  "
2,"""Only people who believe in the Christian ""God"" are moral, is what you're saying.""Actually, I am not saying this.  Nothing I said should have given this conclusion however I apologize if it did.  Realativly speaking, all people are capable of morality.  However, we are only capable in as much as we respond to the Good given to us, not out of our own selves since man is by nature sinful (Romans 5).  Though I understand you may not agree with the Scriptures totally pherhaps we can share the common ground that no person is perfect, people are selfish and are not 100% good.  This is comparable to what the Scriptures talk about that people have a sin nature that we have inherited through Adam by which we have an innate tendency to bend toward sin, e.g. selfishness, unloving heart and behavior etc.  Since the Scriptures teach that God is reaching out to all people everywhere I actually believe that people may be able to act morally good in the true sense if they are responding out of grace given them and by the activity of the Holy Spirit in their soul whether they are Christian or not.  There is even the posiblity of man acting morally good out of an original goodness of man that has not been totaly corrupted by the marr of sin.  Even beside this sinful people may act morally good at a civil level, though not neccsarily in accordance with absolute good.  That is why I say realativly speaking there is moral good that people who are not believrs can do.  Even the good that Christians do, that nonbelievers supposdly cannot due, is the result of the goodness of God at work in them and not any more claimable by that person then any other.  If it wasn't for God they wouldn't be any different.  I hope that wasn't too confusing.  In your second argument you assume many things.  You assume that homosexuals are a class of people that have biological cause to their homosexuality.  In other words, they are ""born with it.""  Not only is this unverifiable it is not were good science is pointing.  Obviously it is not a choice.  As I have wresteled with my own homosexuality I will be the first to say ""I did not choose this."" But there is not way I was born this way.  You say: ""Who the crap are you to know better than ""God"" how a person is supposed to be made?""Can't we I ask you the same question?  How do you know someone living a homosexual lifestyle is living according to God's design?  We know that it is not so because God has told us so through his Word. (1 Timothy 3:16, Leviticus 18:22)  You say: ""If that person was made by ""God"" then it was ""God"" who created that sinful cocktail mix of chemicals that dictates to that person whom he or she will be sexually attracted to. That would make the act of ""God"" a sinful act... which, if you believe in ""God""... you know can't happen.""First off, God created sex and that ""mix of chemicals"" that all are a part of our sexuality are not sinful.  God created sex and he created it good.  The falleness of human nature lends what was originally good to all sorts of deviations.  The Catholic church (although I am not Roman Catholic) does not teach that a homosexual orientation is sinful but acting on it is, you are correct.  But, they do teach that it is an ""intrinsic disorder"" even an evil. Not that the person is responsible to that sin or evil but that the homosexual orientation is a manifestation of human falleness just like all sin is including deviations such as alcholisim and sexual addicition.  The homosexul is a victim to sin like all of us are.  Thanks be to God that he has provided a way out of this and brought life to us anew (Romans 5).  The Scriptures teach:""As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.""  (Ephesians 2:1-5, NIV) We were by natures objects of wrath but God still loved and loves us.  This is preciesly why he gave his son to us that if we believe in him we shall not perish but have everlasting, full life now and later.  The fact that all people are imperfect and have inclinations to sin is not a product of God's creative work but of Satan's twisting of the good creation through sin.  God did not sin in making any of us but all of us have falleness.  Homosexuality is just one of many manifestations of this falleness and like all mankind homosexuals are in need of a savior.  "

1,"I most certainly can and do argue that...1.) Rational [truth is] objective and spiritual truth is subjective2.) Objective truth is higher than subjective truth3.) Rational truth is higher than spiritual truthA belief is objective if it conforms to the facts of reality independent of how anyone interprets it.  Like it or not, reality is what it is regardless of what you and I and any one else thinks about it.  The key for humans is to use our senses to gather evidence about reality, and to use our rational minds to interpret that evidence and act upon it.  Francis Bacon said, ""In order to control nature, you must first obey it""  (That may be a paraphrase).  This means, among other things, that you can't change the nature of reality simply by interpreting it to your liking, or denying the facts, or praying real hard for miracles.  Reality is.  Our minds simply do their best to understand it and act accordingly.  In contrast, spiritual truth as you call it is entirely subjective and has no basis whatever in the real world.  I don't see why you would argue with this assertion. As a man a faith you should agree that there is no proof for your belief in christ or even god.  The nature of faith, of which I assume you are proud, is belief WITHOUT evidence.  The fact that we make mistakes doesn't change any of this.  You are trying to argue that our fallibility as humans makes infallible faith necessary as a guard against our emotionalism, our occasional irrationality, and our inevitable errors.  Wrong.  Our numerous faiths are just as flawed as anything that humans do, you just deny it by claiming that god himself wrote your moral laws.  He did not.  Fallible people did, and fallible people like you interpret them and reinterpret them until they get the answers they want.  Everything that humans do is flawed. But with my system, the flaws can be discovered and fixed through reason.  With your system they are attributed to god and become the law for everyone no matter how ridiculous.  The problem is that belief-without-evidence leads to total subjectivity.  If you reject reality and the human perception thereof as the final standard for truth, then anything goes. Everyone can believe anything they want regardless of its incompatibility with the facts of objective reality.  And this is exactly what we see around the world.  Different religious faiths clash violently because they can't clash rationally through discourse.  When there is no objective evidence to present in support of your religious, faith-based views, all thats left to do with those who disagree is kill them.  So it has been for 5000 years (more probably).  The one truth is objective reality.  If we all accepted that, it would go a long way towards ending hate an violence in the world.  In contrast, purely subjective faith releases our worst demons (metaphorically) and gives them free reign. You say ""Even many of the central principles of American constitutional government are founded in Judeo-Christian principles because these principles were thought of as special revelation, truth give to man from God that is superior to any form of truth gained through rational thought.""  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Christian morality is the EXACT OPPOSITE of the US Constitution.  Christian morality is based on doing the will of god.  Obeying god is good, disobeying is bad.  The ten commandments are a list of things that we CANNOT do. The Constitution, in contrast, is based on respect for the rights of the individual human being, not on the will of any god.  The Constitution is a list of things that CANNOT BE DONE TO US.  The Constitution has the Bill of Rights, the ten commandments are the Bill of Wrongs.  The fact that these two diametrically opposed moral systems frequently draw the same the conclusions (e.g. that murder is wrong) does not change the fact that they do so for entirely different reasons.  To me murder is wrong because it violates the humanity of the victim.  To you its wrong because it violates god regardless of the victim. In short, you can't reject rationalism because humans make mistakes and then accept without question (i.e. on faith) whatever the bible says just because you believe that it's the infallible word of god.  There is no rational basis for you to believe that.  It's just your claim, and it flies in the face of overwhelming evidence against it.  And criticizing my system for being imperfect (which it is) doesn't make yours any better or more reasonable.  It just makes it more dangerous.  Sid "
2,"Peace Sid,You have changed your argument, I see, or perhaps more precisely clarified it from the apparent fallacies I lying there in.  Now that we are on the same page we can move forward.  I want you to know before I continue that I have no desire to belittle you or make you feel inferior because of your lack of faith, or the faith that you do have in rationalism.  Sometimes I find these forums and online means of communication tiresome.  I don't really know you, and you don't really know me.  This isn't the most conducive to honest communication and dialogue.  My overarching aim is to wish you the best in all that life has for you.  When I write peace I do not write it as a mere triviality but as sincere request for peace to come upon you and your life.  With this I shall continue. As arguments do often rest on premises so does yours.  Your premise is ""Rational truth is objective and spiritual truth is subjective.""  I beg to differ.  Rational truth can be objective and it can be subjective it is not more bound in objectivity or subjectivity than spiritual truth or faith faith, for that matter.  Rational truth can be objective as you argue, when it bases itself self out of conclusions drawn from the real including that which is material is this world and in the whole universe.  Even here though, there is a principle assumption that is ""believed,"" that is faith is necessary for reason to be valid objectively because we must assume, or believe with faith, that the human senses are actually and able to perceive the real and that the human mind is able to make sense out what is perceived in a manner that is true.  This basic premise must be believed for rational thought to have any air of possible objectivity.  Rational thought, is therefore, always dependent on a certain amount of faith.  If faith is as you say, belief without evidence then it is a belief in something independent of any concept of the real, it is subjective and all rational truth is therefore subjective.  This is a primary problem in metaphysics.  The first philosophers to shed off the tradition Aristotelian scholasticism found it necessary to validate reality in faith.  Descartes, for instance doubted that our perception of anything is guaranteed except that which is guaranteed by God.  Later philosophers who ""dumped"" the idea that the real can be perceived because God guarantees it also dumped any notion of objective reality.  Objective reality forever became something beyond human grasp nor could any such validation be made of whether there even was an objective reality.  David Hume advanced this concept when he argued that humans merely receive impressions from the outside and makes sense of them internally through laws of association.  This assemblage and putting together of external impressions is an entirely subjective feat.  Immanuel Kant further advanced this when he said that our only understanding of reality is through our experiences.  These experiences he called phenomenon and so humans a a phenomenological attempt at truth but had no access to what he called noumenal reality or what we know as objective reality.  He said that it is the mind that shapes reality and not reality the mind since we put our thoughts together through our categories of understanding.  Other philosophers and anthropologists have even yet further argued that these categories of understanding are primarily determined by our language, such as is argued in the sapir-whorf hypothesis.  The point of my detour through some history of modern philosophy is to show that without God and without faith there is not real.  If any of these Godless, worldviews are adopted then there is no objective reality metaphysically for there to be an objective truth let alone an objective truth that happens to be rational.  Therefore, in either case, whether we can reach an objective reality guaranteed by God or cannot rational and reason is subjective or dependent on faith.  Before I move on I would like to define more precisely what subjective and objective actually mean:""Objective: Having actual existence or reality.""""Subjective: Proceeding from or taking place in a person's mind rather than the external world""Both from The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th edition"
2,"If rational truth is not subjective and it can be validated by this faith, a faith which requires God, then it is dependent on a spiritual truth.  If this spiritual truth is merely subjective than anything built on its foundation must also be subjective.  In this case there is again, no objective rational truth.  However, if it is objective than rational truth can also be objective.  Therefore, if rational truth is objective so must be spiritual truth.  This is not to disregard the reality that each human does have different experiences and phenomenon and that our minds make sense often with our language and other systems of the world around us.  However, there is an objective reality we can know because of God.  God is just an abstract exterior concept that as a principle guarantees our true witness of reality but he himself is involved in this world.  He was involved as its Creator, sustains all things and came into it most definitively in the person of Jesus Christ.  Spiritual truth has a basis in reality.  It is not just human belief but human belief in a real God, in the real person of Jesus Christ.  ""Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.""- (Hebrews 11:1, KJV)Faith is evidence.  It is evidence not of that which is not real but that which, though unseen, is real.  Notice that I have stated that rational truth, if it is able to be objective, can be objective.  It is not always.  By the nature of reason it should be sound but by the nature of the humans who reason we know it is often not.  We are limited.  Rational truth cannot be limited to only materialism or scientisim.  That is rational truth is based in the real but that does not mean it is only based in matter or in the stuff we can see, taste, hear, touch etc.  Nor is it limited to only being correct if it is scientific and is discerned through the scientific method.  Spiritual truth can be perfectly rational but cannot be demanded to bow to the narrow views of materialism or scientisim or naturalism or other human philosophies.  This does not mean that spiritual truth is automatically right because it is spiritual but it does mean that spiritual truth can be rational.  You are correct in asserting that anything humans do is flawed.  Including our rational minds.  Why is it logical that our flawed system of rational should pluck out our flaws when it in itself is flawed. The Word of God however, is from God and through written through men is from him and perfect. Furthermore, faith is also a gift from God.   Truth comes from God, without him there is not truth. Truth begins with him not with man.  Man is not the measure, God is.  That God has spoken to us is how truth comes to us, in the Bible.  This truth came through the real, in real societies, in real men and woman in time and history.  Likewise did Christ, the Word made flesh.  This is the difference between Christianity and all other religions.  As Bishop Fulten Sheen said, ""If religion is mans search for God Christianity is God's search for man.""  We can't assume that all religions have the same origin as if they are all essentially the same when in reality they are not.  The Bible did not come from man but from God.  The pain, unrest and warfare that has spurred from religious conflict is truly tragic.  We should be able to be rational but that does not mean that faith is irrational.  The Ten Commandments are not the opposite of the U.S. Constitution, it historically undeniable fact of their and other Biblical influence on the U.S. Constitution.  The summary of the commandments is not do not but do, do love God and do love your neighbor.  They are laws that deal with God and people.  To kill or murder is wrong in Christian faith because it is a sin against God and against that persons humanity.  God does stuff with purpose, including give his laws.  God hates murder because he loves all people.  He wants us to trust him and obey him out of faith and trust but that doesn't mean that because we should obey him because we love and trust him that his laws have not reason, quite the opposite.  God is definer of justice itself and he is the source of every reason for justice as he is the source of reason.  Biblical faith is not irrational or foolhardy.  """"To God belong wisdom and power;       counsel and understanding are his."" Job 12:13, NIVAgain, peace Sid,Spencer"
2,"""Rational moral truth is based on the observation that people are all basically the same, that they have the same fundamental physical, psychological, and spiritual needs (by ""spiritual"" I do NOT mean, religious or supernatural. I merely mean needs that are not physical).""This understanding of human sameness or shared anthropology is incomplete precisely because you leave out the actual spiritual element of man yet give the illusion that it is included.  The idea that all people are basically the same, i.e.. created equal (again something only guaranteed  by God), is a Biblical idea.  One could suppose that in a modern rationalistic society why would we put so much stock in a principle from a ""dusty old book?""  Perhaps because this dusty old book is right.  You include the physical, biological or bodily part of man (Gk. Soma) and the psychological part (Gk.psyche), but by defining spiritual by something that it is not you actually fail to give an adequate definition which is to state which that thing is.  Equating spiritual needs to ""merely...needs that are not physical"" fails to distinguish between what is actually a spiritual need and what could also be a emotional need or a psychological need which can also not be considered physical in the biological sense.  The implication of this vaguely communicated idea of spiritual need actually leaves out the real essence of spiritual need.  This is necessary to fit the paradigm of ""live and let live"" because such a structure of apparent moral law fails to account for the totality of the human experience not just in the individual human experience but in the communal as well.  It is incapable of doing so because the motive is not the ultimate concern for the common good but an excuse of the individual to unconcern them self with the good of the other.  As the concept ""live and let live"" is shaped by the humanistic framework of individuals operating as laws unto themselves, it fails.  When, as was originally meant in the phrase ""live and let live,"" it is to literally do unto others as you would have them do unto you there is a change for hope.  Here the common good and the good of the neighbor is established.  It is not about how little should be done (tolerate, mind your own business about the life of others) but what should be done (how can I love my neighbor in this circumstance, what does it mean to love my neighbor?).  This is the a central teaching of Jesus Christ and of Christianity.  The modern   evolution   of the idiom however, has scarce remembrances of this original meaning and fails precisely because, again, it does not take into account the breadth of human experience both individually and communally (and is unequipped to address the full experience because its own ethos makes such parts and judgments of others off limits) and has no concern for the common good (because likewise the good cannot be established because the ethos of the modern ""live and let live"" make such judgments impossible).  I should clarify by judgments I don't intend to imply being judgmental  but rather only the ability to judge whether the actions, motives and intentions of the other are morally right or wrong according to the Good.  Compare:""Live and let live, i.e. Do as you would be done by...""-1678, English Proverbs""Live and let live is a pretty good philosophy. If the guy in the next lane isn't buckled up, why not leave him alone?"" (2001, Washington Times)Both quotes acquired from the The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs.[See also my other post, ""Christ...fully reveals man to himself.""]Secondly, you further beg the question, i.e. provide a circular argument, by stating that live and let live is good because watching people live and let live (without the ability to harm others) is good because you have observed it so.  You then conclude, therefore, that homosexuality is not morally wrong.  This is Non Sequitur; where the logic of your agrument does not follow from the premise to the conclusion offered.  Peace and Happy New Year,Spencer"
1,"If Christian conservatives were sincere in their condemnation of homosexuals on BIBLICAL biblical grounds, as I show on my http://LiberalsLikeChrist.Org/about/God&gays.html they would be just as conscientious about applying the   bible  's teaching that those who don't obey the sabbath demands that are repeated forcefully and frequently in ""God's Word"".  How many rich Republicans would support such ""Christian conservatives"" for public offices, if they were demanding that people not work, or shop, or go to   entertainment   events one out of seven days every week?!?In contrast to a few rare and obscure references to   homosexuality   in the O.Testament, the sabbath command is one of the TEN GREAT COMMANDMENTS, and the penalty required by the bible is DEATH.How many show the sincerity of their view of ""God's Word"" by their insistance that people either obey the 4th commandment or DIE?!? (I would have asked, ""should homosexuals be treated as parriahs?"" (even if you view it as one of the MANY behaviors condemned by the bible)"
2,"Absolutely. Of course, being both logical and very religious, nearly every single thing any human has done since the “fall into sin” is a sin. That being said along with the common faith that ultimately there is only one punishment for all unrepentant sin, it should not be regarded as such a touchstone issue. Or at least anymore so than murder or swearing. They are all sins against God, they were already forgiven before they even happened; all you have to do is accept that faith. Why do we treat it differently? Because it involves a sexual act?As human beings we have a tendency to try to categorize things and assign value to actions that don't require it. That is not the way sin works. Homosexuality is essentially the same sin as lusting after someone you pass on the street.I do have to say it's a sin, but only because as humans every thing we do could be considered a sin."
2,"Hi all,I dont wanna write down all the scripture in the word of God, the holy bible, that clearly states that this is a sin, however I do wanna share this. God gives people who want out of this life, understanding, as he did for me. I believe one can be free from feelings, it takes work.  We are all built with a conscience. And something inside of me knew gay feelings were wrong at a young age, I just didnt know why. The church never told me it was wrong, society, or people, I just knew. I think we all can try to remember those first emotions. And so its all ungodly emotions.  Relationships become co-dependant, and we use others to fulfill the pain. Whether its sex or relationship. Nothing is good in homosexuality..Nothing..it's call disfunctional, and can be healed.If you're gay, you understand hurt..and rejection..fear...disappointment..guilt..anger..being left out and misunderstood. A gay lifestyle offers many promises. Freedom, independence, pride, sympathetic understanding, compassion, fulfilled desires, honesty. Being honest about our feelings is so important. Unlike others, the homosexual has struggled through two traumatic births: the natural birth, and the personal birth of self-acceptance. Both passages are marked by pain and great labor, but the product of the natural birth doesn't remember. The product of the personal birth remembers always. However, a Cruel Deception torments the gay community. Once the ""birth"" is accomplished and the person comes out of the closet, the promises are not kept. At first there may be relief, pleasure, and the euphoria of belonging. But can the gay lifestyle ever satisfy the deepest desires and longings of the homosexual man or woman? Could all that freedom, pride and sexual activity be covering up feelings? At best, it brings temporary diversion. At worst unfortunately, it brings despair and death. Why? Because those desires, longings, hurts, and fears are common to humanity and are the result of living in a fallen world. Everyone is affected, and only God can save, heal, and satisfy. We must realize that in most instances, the attraction for the same sex begins before the age of ten and is usually non-sexual, emotional, and involuntary. This brings confusion, fear, and guilt on a young person who is already feeling rejected and unworthy, and increases the need for affirmation. It is very common to experience injured, rejected femininity or insecure masculinity. With sexual maturity, the needs become eroticized and the sexual desire is strong because it is linked to the emotions.  Sexual activity then becomes a way to feel loved and affirmed, and becomes addictive; we cover the pain with pleasure; we idolize someone like us and are esteemed by them; there is some relief from identity confusion, and we can defy, and have some refuge from, a hostile society. But, has this really dealt with the buried emotions, or are we caught in a pattern of behavior that covers them? There is a strong connection between buried feelings and sexual complusion. God has shown all those who have gotten free that all this was changeable, and He wants to go through the process with you. He wants you to experience the intimacy with Him that overcomes all addictive behavior. You will never have intimacy that can compare with the intimacy with God, who loves and cares for you. God does not want to judge you, He wants to save, forgive, deliver, heal, restore, comfort, renew - all the things that only He can do. For these wonderful things to happen, you will need another birth...the spiritual birth. We all do, because we are fallen, and a fallen world has imposed wounds, fears, alienation and identity confusion on us, and we reacted in sinful ways to compensate, console, and protect ourselves. Jesus Christ came for that very reason, to save the lost and helpless. Come to him and let him do his marvelous work in your life..Let His Love heal the wounds; let His goodness dispel the fears; let his presence replace the loneliness; let his grace and mercy cover all your sins, and let Him give you a new identity as His child. He wants to be your Heavenly Father and give you peace, joy, and security that so many have found. ""For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting, and His truth endures to all generations."" Psalm 100:5"
2,"One who has been raised with the knowledge and experience of the scriptures already feels condemned. We don't need to do the condemning but we do need to follow what our hearts and scriptures tell us is right. For most men it is disgusting to think about, nonetheless, we have to face it daily that their are people who think it is perfectly OK to engage in the homosexual lifestyle. It's the society we have helped nuture that has brought us to this choice of yes or no. Pick up your cross (whatever it is),deny yourself, and follow Christ."
1,"lessofself wrote:""we have to face it daily that their are people who think it is perfectly OK to engage in the homosexual lifestyle.""This seems to be a common argument. Make a broad, all-encompassing statement which condemns the homosexual lifestyle and then insist it just a sinful choice.This argument is illogical because it assumes that all homosexuals live the same way and believe the same way, therefore all homosexuals should be condemned.Would it be fair to lump all heterosexuals together into one group and then condemn the heterosexual lifestyle based on disgusting heterosexual activity at Mardi Gras?   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Jonathan-And-David.html   "
1,"Number of gays in the military makes ban infeasible. In December 2007, 28 retired generals and admirals urged Congress to repeal the policy, citing evidence that 65,000 gay men and women are currently serving in the armed forces, and that there are over 1,000,000 gay veterans.[12] Ridding the military of homosexuals would, therefore, seriously reduce the number of armed forces available to the US military and impair the United State's ability to project its foreign policy and national security interests.

2,"when asked recently what i thought of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people...this was my response...they're awesome people, most of my best frenz from my past are gay or lesbian..and just like the rest of us, they're sinners as well..i am a sinner, saved only by His grace. i am so far from being able to walk on water without sinking to the bottom..but He loves me enough to save me by His grace.God loves them as much as He does you or i..Jesus came and died and rose again for them as much as He did for you and i..God doesn't like what they do, as far the kind of life that they live(nor does He like what thieves, liars, and murderers do)..but they are just as able to be delivered from that life, and saved and be heaven-bound as any of the rest of us..unfortunately, there are many, many gays and lesbians that believe they can continue living that life and that God will welcome them into heaven along with those that have confessed their sins, and repented of that life..and God is the only one that can judge, but God will not and cannot allow anyone who is unrepentant into heaven..no matter what the sin is.many and most leaders in the gay church tell their congregations that God is love, and He is..but God is also just..He is holy, and i don't think most people realize exactly what that means..asking forgiveness of Him for what we've done is one thing..being repentant is another. to repent is to confess that sin and turn from it, in some cases(like mine) run from it;) alot of Christians approach the glbt community the wrong way..with hate, and contempt, and self-righteousness, and threats of hellfire and brimstone..which always reminds me of the woman that the pharisees brought to Jesus because she was caught in adultery..when asked what He thought should happen to her for what she had done, He drew a line in the sand and told the crowd of men collected there that ""whoever is without sin, let him be the one to cast the first stone""..after thinking about what the Lord had said, and examining themselves (realizing that none of us is without sin), they set their stones down and left..the Lord then turned back to the woman, asking her where her accusers were..He simply told her ""to go and sin no more""...alot of Christians need to remember that when it comes to the hateful, accusing way(s) that they approach those that are still struggling and lost..."
2,"i only know what i believe, and what the Lord has laid on my heart...my prayer for the gay Christian is that the Lord will lift the veil of deceit that the enemy has placed over their eyes and heart in regards to their personal relationship with the Lord.i know that i believed for the longest time, as i was fence-sitting in my faith, that ""God knew where my heart was"", which is true, but at the same time, God can't and won't allow sin into heaven. even though i knew what i was doing was wrong in His eyes, there was a hope and belief that He would still save me and welcome me into heaven. the thing is, i was struggling with my sexuality and my faith simultaneously, and even though i knew better, i still wasn't willing to give Him my all, my everything. or maybe at that time, i thought that i had given Him enough to work with.i was trapped in that corrupt and vicious circle of sin and repent, sin and repent, sin and repent...and if i'd actually repented at all, i would have leaned heavier on Him, gotten into His Word, and turned my back on the sin and walked away(or in my case, ran the other direction as fast as i could). so, i don't think i ever truly repented.i was also deceived into thinking that as long as i didn't actually go through the act of sex with another person, that it wasn't as bad...when it's scriptural that if we've even so much as lusted after another man(or woman) with our eyes, it is adultery. Matthew 5: 28But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman/man lustfully has already committed adultery with her/him in his/her heart.so, i was guilty right there. whether it was self-abuse, or having sexual relations with someone else, it is still adultery, as it is sex outside the bonds of marriage, and that in God's eyes is wrong.there again, for so long, i felt or bought into that whole ""God knowing where i stand"" thing, what a sad joke...He did know where my heart was, and unfortunately it wasn't truly on Him."
1,"I've talked to many gays and lesbians, and call some of them my close friends. ALL have told me that they KNEW they were gay from an early age! I've been quite saddened when they've told me of their struggles, their self hatred and concomitant self-destructive behaviors. I've listened as they've told me of their families disowning them. I've been awestruck when I've heard their stories of redemption and self-acceptance. Many have told me that they wished God had not created them this way. That tells me that, indeed, GOD CREATED GAY PEOPLE! If God is perfect, then this wasn't a mistake! Maybe he created them so that prosthelytizers might learn a lesson about what Jesus would really do!Here, as always, the problem lies with those who don't practice what they preach. The real problem is those who would control another's actions in the name of religion, social conservatism, or saving the sanctity of marriage (and the children, of course)! The last time I checked, marriage wasn't in any danger! I, for one, will always like women, no matter who or what my neighbor likes. Many of the most ardent opponents of gay rights are repressed homosexuals!  Most gays, along with christians, atheists, and everyone else, just want to be left alone to live their lives in freedom and peace. I know I do!"
2,"PSYOP says >> ""Many have told me that they wished God had not created them this way. That tells me that, indeed, GOD CREATED GAY PEOPLE! If God is perfect, then this wasn't a mistake!""<<There are several major problems with a statement that sounds so right. First of all, our feelings don't determine truth. If we really believed that our world would be in much worse shape than it is. Secondly, no valid scientific evidence exists to support this oft repeated claim. Thirdly, people do change. Since this is demonstrably true, it casts serious doubt on the genetic claims.Fourthly, valid studies do exist to demonstrate that change is possible.We may quibble over the number who do, etc., but not over the fact that they do change.Finally, the Bible is quite clear that because of the fall we are all born sinners. We sin because we are sinners, not vice versa. Thus we all have predisposition to sin, to various challenges both physically and spiritually. Consequently we all need a Savior. A new study says some are predisposed to adultery. Do we accept that and make allowances for it? Or do we use the tools God has given to live the lives He intended. "
1,"A person of faith bringing up scientific evidence?  That is almost funny.  Faith is the antithesis of science.  There is no scientific proof of the existence of God yet you choose to believe.  I respect that choice but science has nothing to do with anything about faith.  Faith, by definition, is the belief in something that there is no proof of.And you bring up adultery. Would you like a list of ""Good Christians"" who have crossed that commandment? Yet I have never heard any Christian spewing hatred and oppression towards their fellow Christians who have strayed. You may want to read up on some of the developments in the Catholic church in the last 10 years.While there may be a passage in the bible that says homosexuality is a sin, there are HUNDREDS of passages that tell you to love your neighbor, judge not, forgiveness, etc etc.  If you are a true Christian then you are to treat your fellow man as you would be treated, gay or not.

You're choosing to ignore mountains of evidence that sexuality is indeed a genetic.  The weight of evidence is heavily leaning that way...  So, in a way, gay people are aberrations of what is normal.  But so are left handed people, albino people, etcetera.   Are left-handed people sinful? Do we tell the double-jointed that they're going to hell for choosing to be double jointed?   Are Downs babies not born the way ""God"" meant them to be born? It's a genetic aberration of the what's normal... but you can't say they're imperfect or you'd be saying ""God"" was imperfect.People change their behaviors... not their genetic ""flaws"". Anyone can tell you what you want to hear.  And people can behave in convincing manners.   That doesn't mean they have ""changed"". A left handed person, until recently, was taught that it was ""wrong"" way to write... and was forced to write with the right.  The person undoubtedly ""changed"".  He wrote with his right hand.  Wow. That obviously means that left-handedness is a choice!!  Yielding to societal pressures means that genetic differences are choices!

2,"Struggling with homosexuality is not necessarily a sin. The sin is actually giving into those desires both mentally and physically. As a former homosexual, I can say that even though I felt the attracted to the same sex, from an early age, I can tell you, I was not born gay. As a matter of fact, I know gay men that have told me they don't believe they were born gay, and still live in that lifestyle. Something that I noticed gay men struggle with is seeing themselves as the men that they were born as. I've asked a couple guys living in that lifestyle, about if they felt like men (even at an early age) and if they ever felt like they had to measure up to what they feel being a man is ( I know that was my case and as I mentioned before, plus I've asked other men who live in the gay lifestyle, and they could relate to me). Another thing that is important to consider is the issue of envy. I believe The reason of why I liked certain kinds of men was because I they happened to have some sort of physical or intellectual feature that I wanted to have, but felt like I didn't have. For example, let's say a certain man ( dealing with homosexuality) wants to have darker skin. He will (most likely) be attracted to men that have darker skin. Now that doesn't mean that he will never feel attracted to someone that has lighter skin, since they might have something that they want to have (physically or mentally)."
1,"Your comment about not being born gay is interesting. But I don't think we can extrapolate from your experience and the experience of a few gay men you've talked to  that no one is born gay.Jesus, contrary to what many people allege, did address homosexuality. The text is Matthew 19:3-12. Jesus says there are three groups of men who CANNOT receive His teaching about Adam and Eve stle marriage.The first group Jesus mentions is born eunuchs. The term eunuch was sometimes used to describe what today we would refer to as gay or homosexual.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Homosexual-Eunuchs.html    I think it is a mistake to assume that gay men are generally the same in their views, beliefs or actions - envious of other men who possess attributes they feel they lack or that gay men are generally effeminate and somehow not real men.Some gay men do exhibit feminine characteristics but then, so do some heterosexual men.

2,"I do believe Jesus discussed homosexuality,(Romans 1:24-27) but not in the way the ""Expert"" is saying.  He is strongly against homosexuality, as he says in many verses. It is a sin.

To interpret Romans 1:24-27 as a condemnation of gays and lesbians rips the passage from its context of idolatry and idols and false worship.To interpret Romans 1:24-27 as condemning homosexuals is to ignore the cultural, historical and religious context Paul addressed when he wrote Romans.First century Christians in Rome were familiar with Cybele's temple because it loomed above the Circus Maximus. The temple was clearly visible and the religious parade every spring, led by the castrated galli priests was well-known to every citizen of Rome.To insist that Paul was addressing the issue of two women or two men who loved each other and wanted to spend their lives together but was not addressing shrine prostitution is a sad misunderstanding of history.Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-And-Shrine-Prostitution.html  "

And these are his characteristics: He has no beard, his hair is lank, and his skin is smooth. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel said in the name of R. Judah b. Jair: 15 Any person whose urine produces no froth; some say: He who urinates without forming an arch; some say: He whose semen is watery; and some say: He whose urine does not ferment. Others say: He whose body does not steam after bathing in the winter season. R. Simeon b.

2,"I read your post and thank you for writing. Not too many people take the time to listen and care for others, but I believe your conclusion is incomplete. Although indeed homosexuals may be from birth and it is not their fault, (that is my personal belief), it does not answer the fundamental question of is it correct behavior or ""good behavior"" for themselves or anyone else. If you determine what is good as doing as you feel compelled, well what if someone felt compelled to murder, or have sex with children since birth? What if they act on that compulsion, and truly many of these sociopaths are that way from birth. Are we to judge them? Yes, their actions are wrong. Do we condemn them? If they commit crimes, yes. But are the actions of homosexuals wrong in some sense? Absolutely. I can say that because I believe in an absolute moral law, someone who does not belive in a moral law beyond themselves cannot use the word absolute. Do we condemn them? No. Why? Have they taken the rights of another in their actions? No. So they are not doing illegal activity. So what do we as a society do? We love them, we treat them as equals, and we decide for ourselves what is morally correct. I believe it is immoral behavior, do I have that right to believe that, who is to tell me my philosophical beliefs , who is to tell them theirs? To ask a question is it a sin, unfortunately sets up both sides for a fight, it may be better to ask, should we live in the context of our own conciences having a view to the liberties of those in our society.

2,"the Christian gay that believes he's doing the right thing and is going to go to heaven is being deceived, and without  fully seeing their sin and repenting of it...they are heading toward sorrow and suffering, whether they love God or not, He loves them, too, and doesn't want that to be their future, but He can't allow them into His presence unless there has been repentance and forgiveness. it's hard on both sides...trying to convince a gay Christian that they're heading for trouble (as they should know they are if they know their bible and what the scriptures clearly state), or the non-Christian gay, as they may not necessarily see the need for Christ in their life, if they haven't been explained to the reasons why we need Jesus as our personal Savior.that's why i feel its crucial that the right witness is sent into the lives of both Christian and non, as there is so much anger towards Jesus and the ""Christian"" community, due largely to the wrong type of witnessing and preaching by those that attend glbt parades, festivals and events to ""spread the Gospel"".i know, having attended the pride parades before, that the ""Christians"" that show up to these events are(more often than not) red-faced, veins bulging in their foreheads, screaming at these people messages of damnation, which i definitely feel is the wrong approach.the world is so used to Christians who use these methods, and when they see them doing that, they think ""why would i want to live like that"" or ""that's what Jesus is all about?"", and they probably do more harm than good for God's kingdom. their intentions might be good, but their delivery is taken offensively, and if that's their method, i can see why. what did Jesus do? and what would Jesus do? i think if we're to reach this community, it needs to be done with love and in such a way that it comes across as that they are truly loved by ourselves and more importantly by Him, but its the lifestyle that is unhealthy and will ultimately lead to death.like i said before, i know i was deceived for a long time, but i think its because i kept hanging onto other sins in my life, and once i gave everything over to Him i was finally able to start to be healed in every area.so, yeah...it's the prayer of realizing our sin, and the resulting deliverance from it. it's hard, too, because i know i had alot of people around me that coddled my sin lifestyle, and filled me with ""feel-good"" vibes, saying ""well, my ""god"" wouldn't send someone to hell for being gay""...and that's the first mistake right there. of course, their ""god"" wouldn't send someone to hell for being gay, because they have just created a ""god"" that fits their liking and approves of such things, whereas it states in scripture a number of times how wrong sexual sin is in the eyes of the Lord. i dont know how many times i'd be engaged in that type of discussion/debate with someone, but if they say their ""god"" wouldn't do that, then that in itself is idolatry, as they've just created their own ""god"". if that were the case, then there would also be a large portion of liars, and thieves, and murderers(all unrepentant) in heaven, and as i said before...God loves us, but He can't allow these things in His kingdom.i have so many friends still in the lifestyle, and i pray daily for their salvation.it breaks my heart that many won't turn to Him in time before its too late, but yet i pray that they may..."

I'm not religious as you can tell.  This country was founded on religious freedom, and yet it seems we have no freedom not to believe what others choose for us to believe.

Well, if you truly believe he is all powerful and is the one to judge him, why can't we leave homosexuals alone?

Sin is the human depravity that causes us to live and do things outside of health limits. I find that like myself and many others I knew, something in our lives led us to making the choice to live gay. Usually it was abuse, molestation, rejection, or parents speaking things over our lives that caused us to become confused about who we were made to be. No on eis born gay but people can be rejected before they even come out of the mothers womb. A baby knows If its wanted and can sense if its going to be harmed.

1,"Audrey, I'm glad you are happy with the choices you have made, but please try not to make the mistake of assuming that everyone's life, experience and sexuality mirrors your own.  I'm going to make some educated guesses, here, and you can feel free to disagree with them or disavow them as you like.  You've made some assumptions about ""all gay people,"" so it is, perhaps, only fair that others make a few about you.Sometimes when you spend a lot of time thinking about a topic, your vision can become a little narrow and it is easy to assume that everyone else must be seeing things the same way you do.  If they claim to see them differently, then it becomes quite natural to assume they must be lying.However, if you can attempt to look beyond your own experience for a moment, it is important to know that there are many, MANY gay and lesbian people who were not abused, molested, rejected or overly controlled by our parents.  Many gay people had perfectly average, typical, relatively uneventful childhoods.You may have made ""choices"" in your early adulthood which caused you to decide to enter a relationship with a woman.  Your innate ability to be sexually attracted to a woman, though, probably did not arise from any ""choice"" that you made or any bad experience in your childhood, but rather, from a sexual orientation which allowed you to be attracted to persons of either gender -- bisexuality.  Some folks are more drawn to opposite gendered individuals while some are more drawn to same-gendered individuals.  Some, however, seem to fall somewhere in the middle.  And for a person who is already feeling confused and vulnerable because of a less-than-ideal childhood, such feelings for people of both genders might be quite confusing.Onto that, then, you layer the convictions taught to you in childhood (or possibly adulthood) that same-gender attractions are ""bad"" or ""sinful.""  Since you, as perhaps a bisexual woman -- I don't know you, and can only guess based upon the history you present -- feel attractions to both genders, it would be quite natural for you to assume that EVERYONE has a similar experience, but that some people choose the ""wrong"" gender, while others choose the ""right"" gender, and that those who choose the ""wrong"" gender are making a ""sinful"" choice, based upon the religious teachings you've been indoctrinated with, or chosen to follow.You then may assume that you chose the ""wrong"" gender BECAUSE of those bad experiences in your childhood, and that if you hadn't had those experiences, you would not have been tempted to choose the ""wrong"" gender for your loving attachments.The problem is, everyone is not you.  Many people truly are NOT attracted to people of both genders.  Most are attracted entirely or mostly to people of the opposite gender.  Some, probably far fewer, are attracted entirely or mostly to people of their own gender.  A few, probably like you, are attracted more or less equally to both.  And regardless of whether we have idyllic childhoods, brutal childhoods, or something in between, we will still be attracted to the gender to which we are innately attracted.  It is really easy to draw conclusions about others based upon your own experiences, but probably more helpful and mature in the long run to LISTEN to the experiences and self-knowledge of others and to try to understand that their experiences and feelings are every bit as valid and true for them as yours are for you.

1,"Since the bible is interpreted in many ways, translated in numerous versions and how the old law does not apply to Christians—then no, homosexuality is not a sin.  Why do religious zealots constantly tell homosexuals that they’re committing a sin by loving another person of the same gender?  What about the woman sitting in the pew next to them who has been divorced, yet remarried again while her husband’s still alive?  It’s adultery.  People are judging based upon their interpretation of the bible, which ultimately separates people. The old law is just that: old.  Look at Galatians chapter two verses 17 through 21:""But what if we seek to be made right with God through faith in Christ and then find out that we are still sinners? Has Christ led us into sin? Of course not! Rather, I make myself guilty if I rebuild the old system I already tore down. For when I tried to keep the law, I realized I could never earn God’s approval. So I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ. I myself no longer live, but Christ lives in me. So I live my life in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I am not one for those who treats the grace of God as meaningless. For if we could be saved by keeping the law, then there was no need for Christ to die. That one sentence says it all: {“For if we could be saved by keeping the law, then there was no need for Christ to die.”}Then you have this passage:“You and I are Jews by birth, not ‘sinners’ like the Gentiles. And yet we Jewish Christians know that we become right with God, not by doing what the law commands, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be accepted by God because of our faith in Christ-and not because we have obeyed the law. ***For no one will ever be saved by obeying the law.***” ~Galatians 2:15-16Relying on Jesus’ sacrifice is why love between two people is not wrong. The Old Law no longer binds us.Then, the ex-gay woman chucked this scripture at me:“Don’t you know that those who do wrong will have no share in the Kingdom of God? Don’t you fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, who are idol worshipers, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals, thieves, greedy people, drunkards, abusers, and swindlers---none of these will have a share in the Kingdom of God.” Corinthians 6:9-11They cherry picked that one and left the second part of that scripture out. It finishes off like this:“There was a time when some of you were just like that, (before Christ), but now your sins have been washed away, and you have been set apart for God. You have been made right with God because of what the Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God have done for you.”If it’s “still” an abomination, then put down the shrimp scampi, because we’re all going hell anyway, as “religious” people will have it.     www.dtrant.blogspot.com   "
2," ""Don't ask don't tell"" softened military policy on gays ""Don't ask don't tell"" made US military policy more flexible and accommodating to gays in the military. The key element was that shifted policy from officers overtly seeking, persecuting, court marshaling, and discharging (often dishonorably), toward a policy that restricted the ability of officers and commanders to inquire on the orientation of a soldier and pursue subsequent action. It also set a higher burden of proof in demonstrating that a person was a homosexual. This general shift toward accommodation was an improvement and should be recognized as such. 
"
2," Lets not distort Scripture. No where in scripture does it say ""hey everyone its ok to have sex with anyone and anything."" In fact the scriptures say the opposite. They don’t even condone more than one partner. However though it is sin this does not mean anyone should hate over it. Scriptures tell the opposite of this too. Love the sinner, hate the sin. I have friends who were and are gay. Though I don’t condone it, I often just share with them the love of Christ and let the Holy Spirit work in them. Ryan a friend from church uses to be gay. He still struggles sometimes, but now he has the strength of Christ. He also now has a family. He gave a speech once at church. It was beautiful. "
2,"When the Old Testament prescribes the death penalty for two men engaging in sexual activity with one another, I think that's pretty convincing evidence that the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God sees it as sinful behavior. "
1,"You are misquoting scripture, bagpiper.  The passage to which you refer says for a man not to ""lie with another man in beds of woman.""  While the meaning of this seems a bit obscure, it clearly is not a blanket condemnation of all same-gender sexuality.  First, it doesn't even apply to women.  Second, there is that troubling reference to ""in beds of woman.""  It would seem to indicate to me that a man who engages in sexual activity with another man in his wife's bed is being condemned here; not surprising, considering that this would be both a situation where someone who is ostensibly heterosexual is engaging in homosexual acts for some reason, and, perhaps more importantly, is commiting adultery in his own wife's bed."
1,"Homosexuality is no more a sin than heterosexuality...however, any sexual act outside of lawful marriage is a sin.  i don't make a distinction there."

1,"A person who has a sexual desire for someone of their same sex, does not commit a sin by having a desire. However, if he indulges the desire in his imagination and then acts upon it (masturbation and/or sexual contact with another) then it becomes a sin. Why is a homosexual act sinful? For the same reason that heterosexual sex outside of marriage is a sin - it injures the people who indulge in it, destroys the presence of grace in the soul, and leads to a warping of the intellect and will, especially one's view of human dignity. "
2,"As I have grown up I have seen the lustful behaviors and sexually driven relationships. I see this as a sin because it not only does a disservice to those involved but it is against what we were naturally created for, a man and a woman. If this were not a sin there would have been two guys in the beginning or two women for that matter. Since men and women were created for the purpose of completing each other as well as to reproduce it is easy to say that a homosexual relationship is sinful. That is what is taught however for Christian homosexuals such as myself it causes a major debate. God says no to this but every sin is forgiven if a person strives for a personal relationship with Christ.Therefore I believe it is a sin but nothing greater or less than any other sin such as murder, lying, betrayal, hatred, etc."
2,"10. And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. 11.

And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them. 13. If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 14.And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. 15. And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. 16.

2,"It says in the bible about not lying with a man as you would a woman (directed at men). So yes, the bible classifies it as a sin. However, it says all sins are equal... so... that small lie you told last week is exactly the same as murdering 1000 people which is the same as stealing a pack of chewing gum which is the same as being gay. Any sin separates us from God so it doesn't matter how 'good' or how 'bad' you are. Romans 3v23 says that 'For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God'. Or in another version and a bit longer:Romans 3 vs 21-24'But in our time something new has been added. What Moses and the prophets witnessed to all those years has happened. The God-setting-things-right that we read about has become Jesus-setting-things-right for us. And not only for us, but for everyone who believes in him. For there is no difference between us and them in this. Since we've compiled this long and sorry record as sinners (both us and them) and proved that we are utterly incapable of living the glorious lives God wills for us, God did it for us. Out of sheer generosity he put us in right standing with himself. A pure gift. He got us out of the mess we're in and restored us to where he always wanted us to be. And he did it by means of Jesus Christ.'Basically God knew that man would never be perfect again so he needed someone to take away the sin that separated us from him so he sent Jesus who took all our sin and set us free from the punishment that we deserve. Because he loves us he gave us a simple way out of hell. Jesus. He 'restored us to where he always wanted us to be'."
2,The commons sense answer is of course it is a sin. Those that beleive in scriptures and our heritage know that it is a sin.  Those that are practicing this behavior know in their hearts it is wrong.  The bible speaks of a time when that which is good is said to be bad and that which is bad will be said to be good.  We will then know that the end is coming soon.  The radical approach to this situation is proof enough of the legitimate points that I make.  Look at how the homosexual audience responded to the recent vote in California. They were ok with voting for BO even though he said marriage is for men and women yet they didn't picket the Black race who voted overwhelmingly against gay marriage. They didn't picket the Muslims who are on record as being against gay marriage.  They violently went after the LDS church.  A church that is very very small and have always been against gay marriage and who are only exercising their God given right to disagree.  So why the violent approach?  Simple really.  You lose it when you know in your heart you are wrong.
1,"I don't believe the Bible was created or related to the exesentence of GOD. If god thinks Homosexuality a sin, Then why would he make Homosexual's? Not to be ridduculed! It's purposturous to assume that Cause it's in the bible that it's real! There are many things in the bible that don't make sence, this being one of them. I think the bible might be a Fictionary tale. It is not a sin! Cause if it was then he would make people born with knives in there hands and a motive to kill! Then if being gay is such a sin, then what are the people that critisize people for who they are? Not sinning? Judgeing people,Not sinning? People shouldn't judge people like that. Is it a sin?Not anymore than judgeing someone who is.If it's a sin that their gay, then it's a sin that your straight."
1,"I don't study the Bible, so I'm not exactly if this is true, but from what I've heard, the Bible defines homosexuality as a sin. If this is true, what if someone who is homosexual doesn't believe in the Bible? What if they're affiliated with another religion? Or no religion? Then, would their personal choice be considered a sin?Many would consider murder wrong. Killing impacts another directly. Choosing someone of the same sex to be a life parter is a personal choice that only directly impacts the two that are involved, and perhaps to some extent, their family and friends. That isn't harming anyone. They make their choices. You make your own. "
1,"all scripture is god breathed(1tim)but scripture never said homosexuality was a sin.under the old covenant not all prohibitions of themselves were sins. num 15:32 While the Israelites were in the desert, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day. 33 Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly, 34 and they kept him in custody, because it was not clear what should be done to him. 35 Then the LORD said to Moses, ""The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp."" 36 So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD commanded Moses.doing household chores is not a sin. the essence doing household chores on the sabbath is not sin. yet under the old covenant because god made a prohibition about it it became a sin.hebrews 8: 7For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another. 8But God found fault with the people and said[b]:    ""The time is coming, declares the Lord,       when I will make a new covenant    with the house of Israel       and with the house of Judah.  9It will not be like the covenant       I made with their forefathers    when I took them by the hand       to lead them out of Egypt,    because they did not remain faithful to my covenant,       and I turned away from them, declares the Lord.  10This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel       after that time, declares the Lord.    I will put my laws in their minds       and write them on their hearts.    I will be their God,       and they will be my people.  11No longer will a man teach his neighbor,       or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,'    because they will all know me,       from the least of them to the greatest.  12For I will forgive their wickedness       and will remember their sins no more.""[c]  13By calling this covenant ""new,"" he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear."
1,"under the new covenant.......... 1thess 5:21 test everything, keep the good. how can we test the law if we are still under it and have a canonical relation to it as in deut 28as believers our test is as specified in 1john1 ""that which have heard, which we have looked at, which we have seen with our eyes, and our hands have touched.""it is a test of witness thru fellowship of the holy spirit, thru the one who lives in each believer(the triune god)of walking in the light.it is a witness to test where the spirit of christ(god) rests. because wherever the spirit of god rests that is what is approved by god.the witness of believers is that believing homosexual lives and  marriages are filled by the fruit of the spirit in the same way as believing heterosexual marriages.jesus said ""you will recognize them by their fruit"" fruit being the fruit of the spirit because it is of the  fruit of the spirit that we lay up treasures in heaven..............these are the things that last.about all this energy about moral law . in romans paul said we are no longer under the law but grace. paul in romans says that under the new covenant we are now led and serve of the spirit. that we are callled  to a higher standard of fulfilling the law(love) rather than following it. because now our conviction about sin is from our heart with the one who lives in us, rather than thru a set of laws about controling are outward physical lives. the law is now for making us conscious of sin..........conscious of loving our neighbor as ourselves.................. the summation of all the law. but it is the spirit that convicts our hearts about our sin.the conviction is thru godly sorrow in our hearts, and it  is without regret.(2cor7:7-10)if king david had loved his neighbor as himself( under the new covenant the 2nd commandment is the summation of all the law(romans)) he would never have stepped into what he did with bathsheba."
1,"Homosexuality is not a   sin   according to the Bible. Any educated Christian would know that. Scholars who have studied the Bible in context of the times and in relation to other passages have shown those passages (Leviticus, Corinthians, Romans, etc) have nothing to do with   homosexuality  . These passages often cherry-picked while ignoring the rest of the Bible. The sins theses passages are referring to are idolatry, prostitution, and rape, not homosexuality.   http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=10620&pid=805    http://www.jesus21.com/content/sex/bible_homosexuality_print.html    http://www.christchapel.com/romans_inter.html    http://www.stjohnsmcc.org/new/about/homosexuality.html    http://www.gaychristian101.com  /Thats why Jesus never mentions it as well. There is nothing immoral, wrong, or sinful about being gay. Jesus, however, clearly states he HATES hypocrites. If you preach goodness, then promote hate and twist the words of the Bible, you are a hypocrite, and will be judged and sent to hell. Homosexuals will not go to hell, hypocrites will. This is very similar to the   religious   bigots of the past, where they took Bible passages to condone slavery, keep women down, and used Bible passages to claim blacks as curses who should be enslaved by the white man. People used God to claim that blacks marrying whites was unnatural, and not of God's will. "
1,"----------------------------Leviticus----------------------------Leviticus is commonly misinterpreted to refer to homosexuals with the following 2 verses:Leviticus 18:22: ""You shall not lie with a male as those who lie with a female; it is an abomination."" Leviticus 20:13: ""If a man lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination and they shall surely be put to death."" These verses have nothing to do with   homosexuality   when you look at the rest of Leviticus and other passages. Both of these verses refer to heterosexuals who participated in fertility rituals in order to guarantee good crops and healthy flocks, not homosexuals, there is absolutely no mention of sexual orientation or homosexuality. Also, the word abomination was used for anything that was considered to be religiously unclean or dealing with any type idol worship.The Hebrew word ""toevah"" was used in Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13. ""Toevah"" has been translated in our Bibles as ""abomination"" or ""detestable"". The ""toevah"" was used throughout the Old Testament for activity involving ethnic contamination and   religious   idolatry. ""Toevah"" refers to things that were ritually unclean - like eating pork. It is significant that another Hebrew word, ""zimah,"" also translated ""abomination,"" which means intrinsic evil or evil by its very nature, was not used in Leviticus 18:22, or Leviticus 20:13.Notice that Lev. 18:2 deals with idolatry. In fact many of the prohibitions in the Holiness Code were connected with idolatrous practices, see 19:26-29.--------------------------------Romans--------------------------------This is another passage commonly taken out of context. Romans was not talking about homosexuality, it was referring to idolatrous practices and other sins. Letters from the Apostle Paul Romans 1:26-27If taken out of context, this passage seems to condemn homosexuals. However, when Romans 1:26-27 is considered within the context of Romans 1:16 through Romans 2:16, the Scriptures clearly present a different   teaching  . Paul was writing to the   church   in Rome. The Roman church had become troubled by divisions related to   spiritual   pride. Paul was addressing the Christians in Rome and teaching about the pagans in Rome. After declaring the   power   of Christ's gospel to save all, he pointed out that the religious people of Rome had refused to even acknowledge GOD as one of their many gods. They had turned their backs on the one true living God and worshiped handmade idols. Paul explained that as a result of their idolatry, every part of their lives had become corrupt and vile. Paul then told the Roman Christians that they were not to judge others. To judge others is to condemn yourself (Romans 2:1). Christians are to love others out of their brokenness and into the   healing   wholeness that is found in Jesus Christ. The Greek word Paul used, that has been translated in our Bibles as ""natural/unnatural"", relates to that which is against one's own inherent nature (i.e., heterosexuals engaging in   homosexual   acts). It was also related to Paul's concept of what was culturally acceptable. The same Greek word is used in I Cor. 11:14-15 in reference to correct hair length for men and women and in Gal. 2:15 in reference to Jews and Gentiles who were such by ""nature."" Paul emphasized that IDOLATRY (not homosexuality) was the evil which resulted in temple prostitution, sadomasochism, and lack of regard for others. "
1,"=========SODOM=========The Sodom Story - Genesis 19:1-29Homophobic Viewpoint: ""Sodom was destroyed because of   homosexuality  ."" Scriptural Viewpoint: Sodom was a lush beautiful region of land whose inhabitants had known the goodness of God. Despite their exposure to, experience with, and witness of the one true loving Creator, the people of Sodom had rejected a relationship with God, and turned to numerous types of idolatry. When God's messengers were sent to the city, the men of Sodom responded by threatening the ultimate act of violent abuse,   murder  , disrespect and humiliation. They were going to RAPE God's representatives. All other Old and New Testament references to Sodom involved the sins of idolatry, inhospitality, indifference toward the poor and the rejection of God's messengers. There are NO REFERENCES to same sex acts or HOMOSEXUALITY. The story of Sodom had nothing to do with homosexuality.====================CORINTHIANS ====================This passage virtually shows how many twist and change God's words to spread hate.I Corinthians 6:9-11Let us examine that very closely.Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate [malakoi], nor   homosexual   offenders [arsenokoites], nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God.First of all, before we address this line, let us consider one thing. Supposedly taken from a 2000+ year old book, understand that the word ""homosexual"" was not coined until 1869 by Austrian-born novelist Karl-Maria Kertbeny. So how it happens to be included in a true reading of the particular biblical passage should make you ponder how accurate the interpretation actually is. So man changing the words of the Bible to conveniently spread hate? I think so.Now onto the interpretation, i've included the original Greek words as well where it's relevant.Paul was attempting to educate the new Christians in Corinth as to what Godly living was all about. In verses 9-10, he listed ways of living that were not compatible with a Christ-centered life. In verse 11, Paul reminded them that they had been saved out of those destructive ways. There are two Greek words in I Corinthians 6:9, which sometimes are translated with a homosexual connotation. First word, ""malakoi"" or ""malakos"" - it literally means soft or mushy; it can mean spineless, wishy-washy or without backbone. ""Malakoi"" was used four other times in the New Testament and it always meant ""soft."" The context of I Corinthians seems to imply a moral softness or decadence, a failure to stand up for what is right and godly. It is significant that for several hundred years there was no sexual connotation assigned to this word. Second word, ""arsenokoitai"" or ""arsenokoites"" - it literally means, ""males having sex."" Early commentaries on I Corinthians related ""arsenokoitai"" to male temple prostitutes and to men having sex with boys. (Idolatrous prostitution and pedophilia are always wrong for those seeking to honor God.) Homosexual relationships were known in the Greco-Roman culture of Paul's day. The Greek word commonly used in reference to adult male same sex partners was ""arrenokoites."" Paul did not use this word. Instead, he created his own, ""arsenokoitai."" If Paul had intended to condemn all adult male same sex partners, he would have used the common word for it. "
2,"KJV 1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

1,"The question's legitimate, I suppose, but the answer is obviously no. A sin must be an action, and   homosexuality   is NOT an action. It's not something you DO, it's something you ARE. It also must be chosen, and sexual orientation is NOT chosen.However, my major objection comes from your supposed ""expert."" That as an expert on this topic you chose the insidious hate group ""Exodus"" to give their proven lies is horrifying. Not ONLY do they promote the hateful lie that it's a ""sin"" to be gay, blasphemously misusing twisted and out of context scripture as their weapon, but they also promote a far more insidious and dangerous lie...that they can ""cure"" homosexuality, turn gay people into straight people.This is not only a PROVEN lie...there is no such thing as a former homosexual...but this lie destroys countless lives. EVERY credible mental   health   authority confirms that not only can a gay person not EVER turn into a heterosexual, but that it causes tremendous damage to try. You should be aware that of the two founders of this hate group, one is still promoting the lie of being a ""former homosexual"" even though he's admitted in interviews that he still ""struggles with temptation"" In other words, he's still attracted romantically and physically to men.In other words, he's still homosexual. Being celebate, or even forcing yourself to have sex with women, doesn't change this fact.On the other hand, the OTHER of the two founders  of Exodus now admits the entire thing was a fraud, and is now living as what he ALWAYS really was...a gay man.Intentionally causing harm to people is a moral outrage. To pretend to be a ""Christian"" group while doing so is blasphemy of the worst kind, like the KKK pretending to be a ""Christian"" group. Exodus should be removed from your site, they're no ""expert"" in anything except promoting bigotry and lies."

1,"The entire concept of sin is ludicrous.  The funniest thing about people that think this way is that they are the pure definition of hypocrite. They take the Bible verbatim, yet they choose what to take verbatim (another discussion if this is a verbatim sin all together) when it benefits but ignore when it doesn't.  For example, the concept of casting the first stone, or the concept that only God can decide right and wrong, or the belief that Jesus supposedly hung out with the dregs of   society   because they had the first chance at heaven.  Those who persecute are the most likely candidates for Hell.  While I don't believe in any of this malarkey, the concept that something which is not one's choice is a sin is hilarious.  Leave homosexuals alone, they are generally nicer and more generous people and closer to the false image we portray of Jesus than any of the finger pointing focus on the family, Southern Baptist morons in this country."

1,"If we accept what the   church   has always taught us that God created us in his Image and that God would never creat imperfect humans, than how can Gays be considered sinful as a group? Most scientific and theological scholars have determined that gays don't make choices to be gay but are born with this!  I never wanted to be gay-but to have a loving wife and   kids   and live a life devoid of discrimination and sorrow at times!  We are all sinners but if you lead a righteous life and follow the example Jesus set for us by loving an acepting everyone, than we will be in heaven!  Jesus Christ never once preached against homosexuals-there is no shred of evidence in the New Testament.I personally do not believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible because it has been interpreted so many times over the years and when you do that, we lose certain meanings as a result.  The far right has always needed to find scapgoat for their hate-being blacks during the civil rights era, the fight over   abortion   rights or now attacking and spreading lies and contempt towards gays and lesbian people.  We aremaking progress but is slow and ever forward despite the huge amount of   money   and hatred that spews from the so-called religious right and other fanatics!  I wonder after they fail trying to convince the American people how wicked and terrible we are, who will they single out for their hatred?  Native   Americans   or maybe the Canadians?"
2,"It isn't popular to go against the so called ""politically correct"" agenda that seems to be sweeping the world, but a spade is still a spade.  God's very own book states clearly that   homosexuality   is an abomination.  You don't have to like it, you don't have to adhere to it, but don't pretend it isn't there.  It's a sin just as much as adultry,   murder  , stealing, bearing false witness, or any other of the countless disgusting things we do.  Before they start to   change   the Bible, they should realize there are some specific verses there that pertain to those who do just that.  "

2,"Gays in the military would be costly in recruiting/retention. Argued in the section on talent, recruiting, and retention, there is good evidence that there are many members of the military as well as prospective recruits that oppose gays in the military, and who may leave the military or avoid enlisting if gays are allowed to serve openly. This would be very costly in dollar-terms to the military. And, while some homosexuals may be lost via a ban on homosexuals, and while this may be costly, it can easily be argued that this is more than outweighed by the costs of losing opponents to gays in the military.

1,"""Because God says so"" is not an acceptable answer on its own, for if   homosexuality   really is immoral then there should be a a logical explanation to   support   it. God would not forbid something without reason. The ill effects of homosexuality should be observable in society. Most respectable scientific organizations that have done research on homosexuality have concluded: 1) Homosexuals are just as stable, healthy, and functional as heterosexuals.  2) People do not choose their sexual orientation. 3) Homosexuals desire the same things from their relationships as heterosexuals (companionship, love, raise families); they are not simply perverse and   sex   driven.  4) Attempting to   change   sexual orientation is usually ineffectual and can be psychologically damaging.List of Health Organizations that analyzed the research and issued policies in support of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and   transgender   people: American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy, American Counseling Association, American Medical Association, National Association of Social Workers, Child Welfare League of America, American Academy of Family Physicians, North American Council on Adoptable Children, American School Counselor Association, American Psychoanalytic Association, National Association of School Psychologists, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Bar Association.Scientific evidence is hard to refute, but many still try. Some argue that their research is effected by liberal   bias  . This is complete fallacy. These organizations are national groups that represents people from a diverse range of political, religious, and racial backgrounds.

1,"It is dangerous to argue that we as humans know God's intent. To simply state ""God's original intent is..."" is simply an opinion, not a fact. These statements have been used throughout history, but are based more in traditions than in factual evidence. Several opinions about ""God's intent"" have shown to be false.At one time people believed that God did not create all races equal and that slavery is acceptable. This is very easy to be supported Biblically, for there is a consistent opinion throughout scripture that slaves must submit to their master, and the Bible states ""slaves are property."" Nowhere in the Bible is slavery condemned. If you believe owning another person as property is wrong, you will not be able to   support   that Biblically. It was believed that   women   were not created equal to men and women have a lower mental capacity than men; women must submit to men. People argued God separated the races for a reason and therefore races should not intermarry. There are Bible verses that, when taken literally, support all of these statements.The churched condemned Galileo as a heretic because he said the earth revolved around the sun. Their understanding was that God created the earth and put humans on it. Therefore, the earth must be the center of the universe. Many well respected religious such as John Calvin and Martin Luther quoted scripture against Galileo. They could not get past their understanding of God's Intent.We cannot know God's original intent and therefore cannot use this as an argument."
2,"Taken from the Bible Romans 1 vs.26-31.""Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.  Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.  In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.  Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.  They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity.  They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice.  They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.The Bible said it not my words."
1,"All scripture is given in a particular historical context. Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN. The particular historical context of Romans 1:26-27 is shrine prostitution, not committed, faithful, same sex partnerships. In the first century AD, the Cybele cult was one of the most powerful in the Roman Empire. Cybele worship included orgiastic sexual rites and ritual bloodletting by priests and priestesses, similar to the practice of Baal worshipers in the Old Testament. “And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.” I Kings 18:28. In first century Rome, religious festivals honoring Cybele were celebrated in one of the five Cybele temples or in the streets. Castrated, long haired priests of Cybele preceded the image of the goddess, beating drums and cymbals, showing off their colorful clothing.   The priests of Cybele were called galli, referring to their castrated eunuch status. Female priestesses and castrated, male eunuch priests functioned as representatives of the goddess, offering themselves sexually to male worshipers. These religious practices flourished in first century Rome and this is what Paul prohibited in Romans 1:26-27.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1-And-Homosexuality.html    "

2,"It is not clear your claim that the context in which Romans was written has to do exclusively with the Cybele cult. Paul wrote that letter to explain his view of the gospel to the romans, and not as a corrective to specific problems as he did on the epistles to the corinthians. He begins explaining how idolatry and pride, led humanity to other sins when their hearts separated from God, including homosexuality.And I think you're being imprecise too in the other passages you quote in the arguments:1. With respect to Adam and Eve, he created them as sexual beings who could fulfill his purpose of 'filling the earth and increase in number' (and the problem of over population doesn't invalidate the command, it was caused by not managing sexuality as God established it) And though later came poligamy, it occurred after fall, and then on the new testament is explicit that godly people should be married to one woman.2. When you quote Lev 18:22 as referred to the cult of Molech, is not precise. When you read the whole chapter, Moses writes a series of sins that include unlawful sexual relationships, amongst homosexuality is found. The fact that the previous verse condemned the parents who offered their sons to Molech, doesn't mean the next verse is related. In fact on every mention of Molech in the bible is related to the child sacrifices (which, by the way, also violate the command to fill the earth and increase in number).Is so clear that two chapters ahead he repeats the command in Leviticus 20:13 ""'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable."" and in this occasion there is no sign it is directly related to the cult of Molech.I think the people at Exodus, as well as you, share the same general goal: to bring those with wanted or unwanted same sex attraction close to God. But in that path the means are as important as the ends. And sadly, one of both positions is wrong, and therefore is sinning (if it were Exodus, in not accepting that is God's will that people have same sex attraction; if it is you and the churches that accept homsexuality as normal, the sin will be of encouraging people to accept a sin as a way of life).I stay with the side that it is a sin."

2,"The context is important, I am not denying that, but we must ask ourselves what is actually condemned.  The Leviticul condemnation is not of prostitution, although the Scripture also condemns that activity both in the context of idolatrous worship and street prostitution, but of any sexual actions between two people of the same sex.  It is an abomination because it flies in the face of God's intention for sexuality.  As previously stated this command is given in a list of commandments that condemn other sexual perversities, that distort the original intended in the sexual gift.  "
2,"Probably what you say about the cults in and the way they worshipped is true (I haven't done research about that yet) However, there are things that stand out to me in Romans 1:24-26 ""24 So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other’s bodies. 25 They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the Creator himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen. 26 That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.""One of them is that it says, God abandoned them. Even though He loved them, His prescence wasn't dwelling with them so there was no sense of truth or conviction. Second it says that they were abandoned to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired and that because of that they did vile things regarding their bodies.  Then it goes on to say that they exchanged the truth for a lie and so they started to worship idols rather than God. Now this is where he addresses homosexuality. Notice how it says that homosexuality is not normal in verse 26 ""Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other."" By looking at the beginning of  verse 24 and verse 26 we can see that before  idolatry and homosexuality are addressed, both verses explain that God left them so that they would follow their own desires. I feel like this part is repeated to address separate(even though they could go together) issues.verse 27 shows the following 27 And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved. This part directly addresses lust and homosexuality.

1,"The problems with your view are manifold.1. Committed, faithful, non-cultic, same sex partnerships are not prohibited in the Old Testament, in Sodom or anywhere else.     http://www.gaychristian101.com/Sin-of-Sodom.html    What the OT prohibits is shrine prostitution. Therefore there is no prior scriptural basis for Paul to prohibit same sex relationships, except for prohibiting shrine prostitution.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Pagan-practices.html    2. Since lesbianism is never condemned in the OT, it is entirely out of context with Paul's argument about idolatry to suddenly inject a one verse condemnation of lesbianism (Romans 1:26) into his idolatry argument.3. Early Christians understood Romans 1:26 as a reference to non-procreative sex as being unnatural. It was hundreds of years later (around AD 330), when John Chrysostom decided Paul might have been referring to lesbians.4. If you'll take the time to read the information at the Links in my previous comment to you, you will discover that early Christians DID understand Romans 1:26-27 as referring to shrine prostitution instead of homosexuality.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Homosexuality-Wrong.html    5. Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN. If Romans 1:26-27 was a reference to shrine prostitution then, its a reference to shrine prostitution now. That doesn't change simply because someone in the twenty first century decides to take the verses out of their historical context. "
2,"In the opening chapter of Romans the Apostle Paul is not listing a command of ""do's and don'ts"" but a listing of chronology of the falleness and depravity of mankind.  St. Paul is going back to the early history of man's rebellion in turning a way from the true, one and only living God and to the worship of created things and other types of idolatry.  Because of this God gave them over to a depraved mind.  A chief sign of this rebellion is the inappropriate sexual actions between women and men.  It is clear in this homosexual action a high abomination is occurring because it is going directly against the created design of  God as revealed in Genesis.  It is a rejection of God and his way and an embracing of a counterfeit.  This is why prevalent homosexuality in a society is a sign that a society is moving away from God and his truth in open rebellion.  It may seem extreme to the modern person but not anymore extreme than the call of all disciples to deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow him.  Jesus makes a way out.  As someone who has and does struggle with homosexuality this is something I can attest to that the walk is not fun or easy but it is what is truth and what God calls all sinners too, repentance.

That is something which the scripture does not say but which Complementarians read into the Bible. In plainer words, it is a private interpretation.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Complementarity.html    By taking the clobber passages out of context and insisting they refer to homosexuality and lesbianism when no human author of the Bible ever linked Sodom and homosexuality (let alone lesbianism) in any of the 48 passages where Sodom is used, the Ex-Gay industry has convinced you to believe a lie.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/BiblicalComplementarity.html    "
2,"but we must be careful when we use the word love because as you and I know they mean very different things in different contexts.  The Bible is full of examples where people love eachother and are not married.  However, this love is not sexual.  Do not then presume (please) that I mean that no intimate human partnerships or relationsihps should occur outside of marriage- that is simply not Biblical or true.  In this case, according to definintion of complementarianisim you offered, I am not a complementarian.  Beyond the possibility of marriage great emotional and social needs and longings are met through parents, siblings, family, best friends, friends, partners, groups, classmates, co-workers, the church, small groups and so forth.  All kinds of human relationships can develop the capacity for intimaciy and in more extreme circumstances partnership.  This is all good and decent granted the realtionships have a realtive level of health; i.e. not subject to co-dependency, violent, or otherwise harmful to the people invovled in those relationships.  What is reserved for marriage though is the fullness of sexual union as embodied in sexual union.  That is, although intimate partnerships and/or relationships happen between people they are not open to sexual union because that specific gift to humanity is reserved for the covenent and relationship of marriage.  There is a difference between what I am advocating, from the Bible, than what you are claiming I am saying.

2,"""Don't ask don't tell"" requires clear proof for discharges.

1,"Spencer-I should have been more precise in my language. By intimate human partnership, I meant committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex marriages.Dr. Gagnon, the leading anti-gay crusader, summarizes the Complementarian position in his 520 page, anti-gay book, The Bible And Homosexual Practice. He says that the creation story in Genesis authorizes only heterosexual union, but never homosexual union.Gagnon asserts that the Genesis account of creation leaves no room for legitimizing same-sex unions. That is the classic statement of the odd hermeneutic Complementarians use to buttress their position.Gagnon even insists that homosexual unions can never be legitimately described as loving. His remarks can be found on pages 194, 291, 297, 327, 339 of his book, The Bible and Homosexual Practice.     http://www.gaychristian101.com/BiblicalComplementarity.html    I don't see any real difference between your position and Dr. Gagnon's position and the position of Joe Dallas and Exodus.

2,"About complementarianisim:Although there seems to be a simillarity between the Platonic account of origins and the account given in Scripture but when actually read in the context of the ""Symposium"" it is quickly realized that simillarities actually fall because the story is so grossly different from the acount given in Genesis.  The accuasation that ""anti-gay"" thearpists are basing their ""complementarity"" views of of Plato and not Scripture is not substantiated.  Those who affirm that homosexuality is sin would find Plato's story in disfavor because it seems to support homosexuality as a natural inclination of some humans.  Those who disfavor a text because of its anthetical argument would not use that text to base their thesis unless they were attacking it.  Therefore the therapits written about in this article are not basing their views off of Plato's ""Symposium"" but off of some other source, a source that would not affirm homosexuality is natural or permittable.  Plato himself, however, reveals his own opinion about homosexuality later in life.  He accounts that it is both against nature and originated when men, because of their lack of self-control, induldged in their passions.  I have found this to be true in the experiances of some homosexualities and especially more common in bisexual men.  Only one section of the ""clobber"" passages are used to connect homosexuality to Sodom and Gomorah so your argument that they are not linked, even if true, does not account the vast majority of Scriptures that deal with homosexuality.  Although traditinoally the story of Sodom and Gomorah has been attributed to the sin of homosexuality I wounldn't disagree that it is not the strongest arguments.  Other Scriptures, however, are much more clear.  And at last, a response to the arguments of the final argument:Argument 1: The Bible does not contain the teaching of complementarianisim and therefore that belief is unbiblical and therefore has no clout.  It is not God's intention, then, that sexual union must occur in heterosexual, monogomaus relationships within the covenent of marriage.  This is false because in actuality the teaching is in the Bible.  It is right in Genesis where this is truth is supressed in the wayward search for loophole for homosexual practice.  ""So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place."" (Gensis 2:21, NASB)The Hebrew word we get ""deep sleep"" from is tardemah and even suggests a trance and a type of ecstasy that Adam went under as God made woman from him.  It is suggestive of the reality that whom God made for him would be as promised, a suitable helper for him (since none was found previous to that).  It is of particular interest that God not,,, make another man but made a woman.  "
2,"""The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man.The man said,         ""This is now bone of my bones,         And flesh of my flesh;         She shall be called Woman,         Because she was taken out of Man.""  For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.  And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed."" (Genesis 2:22-25, NASB)  Here we see that the one flesh union (which is sexual union, 1 Co 6:16) has an intrinsic desgin between the one man and one woman.  This also is the design and beginning of marriage for we see that they are now husband and wife.  No marriage in Scripture is never anything but heterosexual and although at times polegomy is practiced by peoople in the Bible that does not mean it is God's favor.  We see here from the begining and from the teachings of Jesus and the church that clearly practices were tolerated because of hardness of heart, not because God favored them.  As for complementarianism, it is supported by St. Paul- or should we accuse him of basing his view off of Plato too?  ""For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man; for indeed man was not created for the woman's sake, but woman for the man's sake."" (1 Corinthians 11:8-9, NASB)Also notice that prior to woman being taken from man man is always reffered to as Hb. Adam, man as in mankind, human kind.  However, as the man declairs that woman is taken from man he no longer uses the word Adam, as Adam no longer sufices as a description of himself becasue he is no mankind in this sense without woman who is taken from him, he is (Hb.)'iysh, that is, man, male, husband, servant in contrast to the female.  Earlier in the first chapter we can also see that marraige is connected to procreation (which is obviosly not possible in a homosexual context).  Plato and the Bible actually agree on one point, homosexuality is against nature as it is against God's created design both for marraige and for the nature of marraige which is built in the complentary aspects of the male and female, masculine and femminine.  argument 2: God doesn't mention in Scripture that he will only bless heterosexual marriages. Actually it does.  Since marriage by nature is heterosexual and God only blesses sexual union in the context of marriage this is taken for granted.  In any case, where does it say he will bless a homosexual union?  It doesn't, rather He calls it an abomination (not a blessing).  "
2,"argument 3: Pologmy in the Bible proves that the complementary theory is not how God sees it.  There is murder in the Bible, there is rape, there is theft but does God look favorly on any of these things?  No!  Just like homosexuality all of these things are condemed as sinful.  Just because it is in the Bible does not mean it is blessed by God or favored, that is terrible reasoning."
2,"argument 4:Because the theory is not in the Bible it is based on what one wishes to see in the Bible, not a good foudation for belief.What a case of projection.  It is just flipping the reality, supressing the truth.  The complementary nature of man and woman is clearly in the Scritpure just as it is that homosexuality is sinful.  What is really happening is that men are suppressing the truth in their wickedness and gathering around them all kinds of teachers who will teach only what their itching ears want to hear, since they will no longer put up with sound doctrine.  I have struggled wtih homosexuality since I hit puberty (6+years) and in the past identified as gay, homosexual, a Christian walking out of homosexuality, ex-gay and at last I can say that I am so glad I shed the false identities the world and the enemy of my soul wanted me to believe because he who is free in the Son of God is free indeed.  Although I still struggle with homosexuality at some level it is nothing compared to what it used to be and I have developed attractions for woman (something I never, never in my wildest imaginatinos thought would be possible no matter how many times I quoted all things are possible with God).  This article claims that homosexuals interperate the Bible differently because they approach it with their own suppositions (private interpretation) and then accuses those who actually believe what the text says of doing it.  It is falid and a satanic deception to those struggling with their gender and sexual idnentity.  I say satanic not just to bad mouth it but because satan is the father of lies and when he lies he speaks his native toung.  This article and website is about lies and perverting the truth (though be it with whatever peceived good intentions)."

Yes your right, it is a sin, but should we try and stop them doing it or should we be leading them out of sin by sharing our faith?My pastor has a saying ""They know what were against, but not what were for!""  Brian Greenaway was an Hell's Angel.  He murdered, beat people up for fun, slept around and many other things, without caring about the sins he was doing.  One day he turned to Christ with the help of caring christians.  Is he more deserving then gays?You can say ""It says in the   bible  "" that they are wrong, or you can support them and lead them to Christ and let them discover for themselves that they need turn their hearts around.I'd like to   add  .  I know a pair of male christians who love each other and live together, but they claim that they have been celibate since believing.  I cannot know if they ever backslide, but who can say that they never slip back to their old ways once in a while.  Would you condemn them for still living together?  All I know is that their faith is shown in their lives and that is all I care about as I know that I could have a long list of faults that I should look at in my life."
1,"We need to also remember a couple of important things about passages from any Bible.  First, even if they WERE Divinely inspired, they've been translated many times over thousands of years.  So you have mistakes, misinterpretations, and even the infusion of personal opinion.  Think about this...1000 years from now if someone attempts to translate an English document, they may not realize that the words ""man,"" ""men,"" and even ""mankind"" have traditionally referred to all human beings regardless of gender.  Think about the misinterpretations that would create in translation.Second, and this is important... the Bible was written during times when human beings weren't as enlightened and educated as they are now.  People didn't understand the underlying psychology and science of metaphysics.  So Bibles were written to cater to those more ignorant times.  They are full of allegories and simplistic rules and laws in order to control behavior during times when reason wasn't as evolved.  So anyone who still views these simplistic and modified writings as the ultimate law of human behavior, is still living in ignorance.  Two more comments:  1.  If someone is going to quote the Bible as a guide to behavior, then they need to take heed of the entire teachings of the Bible, including the admonishment to NOT JUDGE others.  If you're going to quote the Bible, you lose all credibility if you pass judgement on another person....you're immediately refuting yourself and you look ignorant and foolish.  If you truly understand and adopt the teachings as a GUIDE to living, then you will never utter a word against another human being, but instead take care to treat others with compassion and respect.  Those of you who quote portions of the Bible out of context of the entire missive (if you believe it to be such) are showing ignorance.2.  Any credible psychologist knows that people often speak up against and condemn things that they don't like within themselves.  Almost all homophobic opinions and behavior stem from the speaker's difficulty accepting those feelings within themselves.  Homophobic behavior simply reveals a lack of adjustment to homosexual inclinations."
2,"Quoting the passage that we can not judge is taking a text out of context. The Bible states that in order to judge you have to take the speck from your eye in order to judge correctly. And does not Paul state in his letter to corinthians: ""Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?""I know many people that has changed his homosexual behaviour. Maybe they continue struggling with the attractions, but their acts state they want to change. Another one may be tempted to use drugs or abuse of alcohol. But if he doesn't use them, can we say he is an addict of a drunk? The same is for people with unwanted homosexual desires which live a heterosexual life. Encouraging those who live a homosexual lifestyle doesn't help them."
1,"This is another example of misinterpreting the scriptures.  The ""speck in the eye"" is an allegorical reference to the fact that no human being is without fault, therefore not qualified to pass judgements.  All human beings have specks in their eyes. And since when is a saint considered to be a normal human being?    This forum is about homosexuality being a sin.  If a homosexual cannot accept his or  her feelings and wishes to suppress and ignore them, that is their choice. But that does not make it a sin.  JUDGING homosexuality is a sin.  Also, comparing homosexuality to drugs or alcohol is ignorant.  It's like comparing a fish to a bicycle.  Again, I point out that using the Bible as the basis for a viewpoint like this is unsound reasoning. It is an allegorical piece of literature, a text translated many times, colored by personal opinion, open to countless interpretations of the same passages depending on a person's viewpoint, and not shared by all humankind.  Those who view homosexuality as a sin simply have no concrete basis for their viewpoint.  In fact, the most enlightened spiritual teachings refute the concept of ""sin"" as presented by the christians.   "

1,"Homosexuality or any sort of human sexual expression is a ""sin"" only in a narrowly-focused set of values. The real question to ask is, assuming you love your own individual life, would homosexual behavior on your part be a ""sin"", ""immoral"" or ""unethical"" according to your own set of values?Nothing genuinely factual and no consistently logical argument thus far leads to the conclusion that homosexual behavior among human beings is objectively and universally sinful, immoral, unethical. The question must always be, what does the individual value? Why? According to what factual information? According to what reason?The Judeo-Christian philosophies and religions have a long tradition, however, and despite the  claims of their adherents, they have never and never will reflect anything resembling authentically objective and universal values. They therefore cannot speak in universal terms in relation to their own group value sets, nor can they rationally compel their values on non-members of their respective groups.Whatever rights one has derives from the fact of one's own life and from nowhere else. Your own right to your life cannot be factually and logically extended to justify any ""right to the life of another"". Due to circumstances, one may be a liberty to compel the life of another, however, one cannot have the right to do so. No such right exists. One's own values must reign supreme in one's own life - even if those values are in some way borrowed from the values of others, however, one's own values, again, cannot be factually and logically extended to become the involuntary values of another.That homosexuality is universally a ""sin"" in the narrow view of Judeo-Christian-Muslim beliefs is debated even among members of those philosophies. Those beliefs, those values are not universal and cannot be argued as such. Yes, homosexuality is a sin ... to some. No, it isn't to others. If there is an ethical struggle on the issue, it is this - does one individual have any right to compel their values onto another, whether they be in support or against human homosexual behavior?Facts and logic suggest the answer to that is - no."

[arsenokoitai]- I Cor 6:9 in Greek, from the Textus Receptus.The problem with saying arsenokoitai means homosexual is that, in ancient times, arsenokoitai was never used with our modern meaning of homosexual.Conservative evangelical New Testament scholar, Dr. Gordon Fee (he's heterosexual) says that arsenokoitai is rarely used in Greek literature,     “especially when describing homosexual activity.” The quote is from p. 244 of his commentary, The First Epistle To The Corinthians, Eerdmans, 1987, by Dr. Gordon D. Fee.Dr. Fee still believes I Cor 6:9 refers to homosexual activity but he is honest enough to admit that his opinion is nothing more than  ""a best guess.""  I am not willing to be silent when Christians attack gay or lesbian relationships with faulty ""best guesses"" while ignoring actual historical usage of arsenokoitai. When we factor in actual usage of the word, arsenokoitai, honesty compels the conclusion that arsenokoitai does not mean homosexual. Some Christians admit that the word arsenokoitai was never used to mean homosexual. Then they insist that arsenokoites means homosexual anyway, since arseno means man and koite is a euphemism for sex. Their reasoning is that when the two parts are combined into one word, it must mean homosexual.Famous British scholar, Dr. James Barr, (he was heterosexual) 1924-2006, was called by the Times Online obituary, “probably the most significant Hebrew and Old Testament scholar in Britain in the twentieth century.”  Here is what Dr. Barr said about the etymology of words.    “The main point is that the etymology of a word is not a statement about its meaning but about its history... ...it is quite wrong to suppose that the etymology of a word is necessarily a guide either to its ‘proper’ meaning in a later period or to its actual meaning in that period.”    James Barr, The Semantics of Biblical Language, Oxford University Press, New York, 1961, p. 109.The way arsenokoites was actually used in the ancient Greek language must be our guide as to its meaning. In ancient times, arsenokoitai was never used with our modern meaning of homosexual.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Arsenokoites.html    "

As fellow christians, it's not are job to condemn but to build up and love as Christ loves us.  If a prostitute with a habit handed their lives to Christ, I wouldn't expect them to stop earning a living in the only way they know how, even if it is sinning.  They would need our support and understanding to help them move into a new and productive career over a period of time.  They would also need to be taught (with love) the message of the   bible   and help to understand how to accept His unconditional forgiveness.

1,"Let's examine what the companion passage to Mark 10, says, since Matthew 19 is the major passage used to clobber gay people on the topic of marriage.Matthew 19:3-12 deals with God’s view of heterosexual marriage and natural exceptions to heterosexual marriage as Jesus intended His followers to understand them. Jesus says some eunuchs are born that way, from their mother's womb. Jesus does not say born eunuchs enter the world with genital deformities. Instead, He makes a distinction between born eunuchs and eunuchs who have been physically castrated (suffered genital deformity) by illness or by men. Jesus also makes a clear distinction between born eunuchs and eunuchs who make a choice to voluntarily abstain from marriage, for the kingdom of heaven.In Matthew 19, Jesus cites Adam and Eve as the norm for marriage but carefully makes exception for people called eunuchs. According to Jesus, a eunuch is one who cannot receive His teaching about heterosexual marriage according to the Adam and Eve model. Jesus informs us that of the three classes of eunuchs, the first class is born that way. In other words, born eunuchs are not physically castrated and born eunuchs are not required to abstain from marriage with an orientation compatible partner. They are born eunuchs from their mother’s womb, unable to receive Jesus’ teaching about the Adam and Eve marriage model yet Jesus differentiates between them and castrated eunuchs and them and metaphysical eunuchs (eunuchs who make a personal decision not to marry).History demonstrates that what we call gay men today, were called eunuchs by our spiritual ancestors. In Matthew 19:12, Jesus very clearly says born eunuchs, what today we call homosexuals, were born that way.In case you doubt that born eunuchs were gay people, please note that Dr. Robert Gagnon, the leading anti-gay crusader of the twenty-first century, admits that:""Probably 'born eunuchs' in the ancient world did include people homosexually inclined...""When even Dr. Robert Gagnon, our most vociferous opponent, admits this historical fact, our argument is largely won.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Eunuchs-Are-Gay.html    "

2,"In both of these passages, Paul uses the Greek term arsenokoite in reference to male homosexuality.  The conventional understanding has been that Paul is specifically addressing homosexuality within this passage.The pro-gay theological stance is that Paul is extremely concerned about prostitution within I Corinthians 6 and is mainly referring to male prostitutes.  This word is only used within I Corinthians and I Timothy but nowhere else in the literature of the period.(1)  John Boswell states that there were other words for “homosexual” in the Greek language so there was little need to use this term.(2)   Also the word arsenokoite is a term that Paul has created from the words arsenos (man) and koite (couch or bed) and is specific to him.  Therefore, Paul is condemning sexual immorality in general and not referring to committed homosexual relationships.  While it is true that the term arsenokoite appears to be of Paul’s invention, the context in which it appears is not nullified because of Paul’s originality.  In fact, Paul coined 179 words throughout the New Testament.  The words arsenos and koiten are taken directly from the Holiness Code of the Septuagint.(3)   Because arsen is Greek for “man” and koites means “bed”, the connotation of sexual activity is predominant.  The Septuagint’s translation of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 places the words arsenos and koite in close proximity to each other and is suggested by Martii Nissinen that Paul is creating a neologism based upon the Septuagint.(4)   These are the previously referred passages in which homosexual behavior is expressly forbidden.  This further complicates the position that another meaning other than homosexuality is implied.  In I Corinthians 5:1, Paul begins by addressing sexual matters with the general term porneia, ‘sexual immorality’.  This is applied to a case of heterosexual immorality in verse 1 regarding a man’s stepmother.  In the following verses there are initial references to porneia referencing heterosexual immorality followed by arsenokoitai which references the homosexual contrast.(5)    In this context, one must consider the intent of arsenokoite in its perceived application to prostitution.  Arsenos signifying ‘male’ is a clear emphasis on gender.   Koite meaning ‘couch’ is listed only twice in the New Testament in a sexual connotation.  There is nothing within these words that would implicate a trade or bartering.  __________________________________1 Rev.

1,"Exodus International has put out a call to its membership to come here and support Jeff Buchanan's position that homosexuality is inherently sinful and that the Bible condemns it.  Sorry, but I can't support those concepts.  Much of what I would like to say has already been covered in the excellent posts above, but I'd just like to add that the handful of Biblical passages which have been historically misused to condemn gay relationships have nothing to do with same-gendered persons engaging in loving, faithful and committed monogamous relation to one another.  Rather, they have to do with heterosexual people (men, in all but one instance) engaging in practices such as adulterous behavior with another man in their own wife's bed; sexual intercourse and orgies with temple prostitutes in service of false gods; buying and selling of sexual slaves; males raping other males by way of showing conquest and domination.These are most certainly vile and hideous practices. But they have nothing to do with homosexual persons engaging in committed, loving relationships.  In a paraphrase of an unknown author, ""These are not homosexuals behaving badly; they are heterosexuals behaving attrociously.""God does not condemn loving, committed, supportive partnerships which display and represent God's love for humanity.  God condemns those who abuse and exploit and do harm to their fellow human beings, regardless of gender.  "

After coming to know Jesus, I read Romans and realized that I could not be a Christian and a lesbian.  It wasn't God's intention for human sexuality and if I truly loved God, I would be obedient to His word.  I didn't need a tortured interpretation of the Bible to convince me to follow my own proclivities. Instead, a common-sense, historically sound reading of the Bible convinced that God didn't need to change, I did.  It was then that I began the journey of transformation and sanctification.  Never have a I regretted and never have I looked back. I always enjoyed being a lesbian, but never did I have the joy and peace that I do now.  Praise the Lord!"
1,"I'm genuinely astonished that people seriously:1. think it is rational that a book written by human beings could actually represent the views of God, and reasonable to use the Bible as a literal supernatural rendering of right and wrong. All religious texts are an expression of human values, specifically those of the authors. It is a noble endeavor to engage questions of morality. I think it is hubris if people aren't deeply troubled about using a book written by human beings as the basis for claims about God. 2. I'm also astonished by people who use the Bible as an expression of God's will so easily ignore the things that don't trouble them, like Paul's instruction that women should cover their heads in church (and keep their mouths shut, by the way), while being so certain that homosexuality is a sin and going to great lengths to shame, stereotype (in many cases, commit false witness against - intentionally, or, through their lack of education about these issues, unintentionally), and discriminate against gays and lesbians.I pray for the day when it is no longer acceptable for people to deny responsibility for their beliefs or actions by saying ""well, that's what the Bible says, that's what I was taught is true.""  We can and must do better than this for the sake of humanity."
1,"Good points, Christine.   I think people usually narrow their focus on only what affects them the most.  It's a fact of human psychology that people most often condemn the things in themselves that they find most hard to accept.  Most homophobic people are either fearful of some of the feelings of affection for the same gender, which upsets or confuses them, or they're closeted and can't face it.  So they find whatever they can, wherever they can, to somehow counter the confusion.  Literature like the Bible gives people ample material to quote in order to deal with their own problems.  They are attacking what they dislike the most in themselves, and looking for the best ammunition they can find.Of course, every time I say this to a homophobe, they get outraged and defensive...which is also explained in basic psychology texts.  That's why you'll never win an argument with a religious fundamentalist about a subject like this...not until they accept themselves and their feelings.  I have to admit that although I find their views offensive, I do feel sorry for the conflict that goes on inside them."
2,"Turning to the Bible as a guide to determine whether homosexual behavior is viewed as sin, there can be no denial that there are some ten or more biblical texts which clearly reference homosexual practices or behavior in one form or another in the combined Old and New testaments.  Further, there also should be no denial that every one of these texts describes homosexuality in a negative light, as unacceptable to the people who believed they understood the mind and will of their God. People who lived across many centuries and cultures!	As Christians for whom ""sola scriptura"" is important, we believe we can go to the Bible for guidance and counsel. We have believed it is a reliable and inspired source for truth, assistance and direction. When we do, we find ourselves in the company of many who are engaged in an intense scrutiny of these ten scripture passages in the Old and New Testaments which focus on this issue. Both traditional biblical interpreters and so-called revisionist biblical interpreters have engaged in extensive analysis of these passages to find evidence, which supports their respective positions. 	Unfortunately the scriptural debate about homosexuality often only focuses on these ten passages and their historical, cultural meanings. In doing so, it neglects the larger worldview which the Bible teaches about holiness, godliness, sin and self-discipline. It misses the forest for the trees. The debate has been often argued from the particular to the general. The Bible is much more than the sum of it’s parts. The Bible is the book of inspired writings which embodies a godly spirit or worldview because it embodies the Spirit of God.  	In the Book of Leviticus (RSV) for instance, there are two passages which have received much attention: Leviticus 18:22 says, ""You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination."" The other is Leviticus 20:13 – ""If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.""	These prohibitions in Leviticus are representative passages concerning this issue. They are especially useful for grasping the biblical worldview of which these verses are specific examples. I contend that it is this biblical worldview from which we are able to best grasp an accurate perspective about same-sex attraction and sexual behavior. It is a biblical worldview which God asks His followers to adopt. It is His point-of-view which God asks us to adopt. He asks us to get the Spirit of his mind and heart. 	Bible-believing Christians don’t live on the basis of one or two or twenty verses of scripture. We live within a worldview of principles, standards, morals, values and ideals which the Bible teaches from Genesis through Revelation. Taken as a whole, this worldview represents the mind and heart and will of a loving Father God.	This is obvious from the people who come for Sexual Orientation Resolution Therapy (SORT). No one has ever come into therapy saying, ""Hey, you know what, I just read Leviticus 18:22 and I don’t want to be abominable anymore!"" Everyone who has entered resolution therapy or come to our support group, and who has been successful at resolution does so because they understand the Bible generally and have grasped the heart of their Father God. They understand the Word cumulatively as a worldview in which same-sex sexual behavior is unacceptable to God. The biblically faithful SSA Christian client in therapy understands that in the biblical context, a God-view of homosexual behavior is sinful. "
2,"First off I want to thank you for being faithful to our Lord Jesus Christ in the very difficult walk many people, including myself, who struggle with homosexuality face.  As much you want to argue around the teaching of Scripture it is very clear that homosexuality IS mentioned and IS called sin.  The good news is that, like all sinners, in Jesus Christ we have the hope of salvation.  In Jesus Christ a new word is spoken, a word of freedom, a word of healing, a word of restoration, a word that calls us back to move forward, to become who we already are in the dreams and love of God.  It is not a freedom that permits sin but rather frees us from it to be the people of God, the people of the church, followers of Christ, Christians.  Thank God I have found this freedom.  Leaving the crippling false identity of the ""homosexual"" has been a breath of fresh air as deep as the breath God put in me when he nit me together in my mother's womb.  Know my identity is shaped in and under the Word and Lordship of Christ instead of my self-claimed identity lording over my faith and life.  Peace be upon you brother,Spencer"

This levels the playing field to a certain extent. It means that commanders and officers cannot alienate and persecute soldiers out of speculation that they may be gay. This was the compromise that was struck when Bill Clinton sought to enable gays in the military, but was met with heavy resistance. Restrictions on officers and commanders inquiring about the orientation of members of the military was an improvement over the previous policy, which forbid gays and allowed overt inquires and persecutions.

2,"All the Scriptures below remind us that we have a sinful nature, and because of this sinful nature we have inclinations of different kinds. (This is why Dr. Dobson mentioned that in some cases people do not choose to feel same sex attraction) To have an inclination does not mean that we cannot use our God given free will/choice to choose what is right; our ability to reason is not in vain, it is because God, our Creator, did not want us to be like robots; He tells us through the Scriptures what is pure, noble and right, but it is up to us what we choose, or how we want to interpret His word to fit our sinful natures and try to silence our consciences. No matter how many want to justify sin, in the end, sin is sin, and each one will receive what is due according to his/her deeds.  *Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. Romans 8:5*Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. Romans 8:8*Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation—but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it.  Romans 8:12*For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. Romans 8:13*Therefore, God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.  They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.  Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lust. EVEN THEIR WOMEN EXCHANGED NATURAL RELATIONS FOR UNNATURAL ONES. IN THE SAME WAY MEN ALSO ABANDONED NATURAL RELATIONS WITH WOMEN AND WERE INFLAMED WITH LUST FOR ONE ANOTHER. MEN COMMITTED   INDECENT ACTS WITH OTHER MEN, AND RECEIVED IN THEMSELVES THE DUE PENALTY FOR THEIR PERVERSION.  ROMANS 1:24-27 *“If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.

1,"I'm really starting to think that ""Christians"" such as yourself take the words of Paul to mean more than the words of Christ.  If you're a Christian... show me where Jesus - you know... the person whom you're supposed to be following - says that being gay is a sin.  Tell me how you think Jesus would have reacted to a gay person sharing Christ's message.  Tell me if you think Jesus would have treated a gay man or woman any differently than a leper, or a whore, or anyone else. "
2,"Hi SocialistBetty,Thank you so much for your question.  I do not think that Christ would have reacted in a negative way to a gay person sharing His message as long as this person does not act on his/her tendency—same sex attraction.  All of us have tendencies and struggles; this is the reason why Christ died on the cross for us.I believe that individuals are more than just their sexuality  and no one should be defined and/or valued based only on a sexual tendency. What  about their character, talents,  interests, love for Christ and other people, etc., etc. I want to share this article which explain what I would like to tell you.Written by: Mike Ensley | March 6th, 2008 The answer that immediately comes to mind is, “Well, yeah!” We know God loves everybody, but then we’re confused when we see Bible verses that say homosexuality is a sin. What does that mean for gays?Let’s ask ourselves: does God think the way we do? Not quite (Isaiah 55:9). So I wonder if God would even think of people as “gay” or “straight” in the first place? Like the verse linked to above says, God’s ways are much higher than ours. You know, the Bible really never classifies people as “gay” or “homosexual” (even though some translations make it seem that way). The Scriptures only ever talk about homosexuality being a kind of behavior–not a kind of person.So it’s more accurate to say that, rather than seeing people as “gay,” God just sees people–some of whom have same-sex attractions, and others who have different struggles. And He loves them all. The only question is whether we are willing to daily make an effort in faith to submit our ground-level ways to His heavenly ones .No matter what your struggle looks like, though, it doesn’t have to dictate your identity, actions or destiny. A big part of starting this journey is learning to stop thinking the way the crowd thinks, to stop believing everything you’re told just because it’s popular opinion.Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect. (Romans 12:2)SocialistBetty, please let me know if you have any other questions and God bless you =0)Reina"
1,"I am not gay. I have nothing against gays.  It is their life, not mine. I am not religious.  Why must I face this barrage over this book which I feel has no mandate in MY life? This is a collections of writings from a time when very few people could write. I find it no more binding than a collection of National Enquirer's from the 1950's.When it comes to civil rights, the Bible should be left at home. Government and religion should not mix.  Ever.I respect your rights to have your faith. Please respect my absence of faith.Where gayness and sin are concerned.... leave them alone.  Don't they have enough to deal with?  Can you imagine how difficult it is to be different and on top of that to be told that you are a ""sinner""?  How cruel can you be to do this?No, it is not a sin. Show me where it is a ""sin"" without using your book. How can love be wrong?  Honestly, I just don't get it.Michelle"
1,"Those who turn to Leviticus and other passages to confirm preconcieved beliefs about homosexuality are only cherry picking--these same books say many other normal things are sins, from the sorts of clothes one wears to what you eat. Do those who find homosexuality sinful find the other things in these passages sinful as well? Or are they cherry picking?"
1,"I have issues with people claiming either ""yes"" or ""no."" Let's say you believe ""no."" Does that mean you get to have sex with whomever you want? Most of my male gay friends couldn't lead a monogamous relationship if God himself came down, slapped them in the face with a turkey, and said ""dude, seriously? Knock it off."" Maybe that's just the crowd I run around with. But if you sleep with everything that casts a shadow, whether you're gay or straight, you're still a slut. And I'm pretty sure the bible outlines God's feelings towards sluts. Also, if you believe having sex before marriage constitutes as a sin and you're still living in one of those states that doesn't allow same sex marriage...you can see how this could be a problem...If you say ""yes"" to the whole ""homosexuality is a sin"" that's fine. You're entitled to your beliefs. But I have never seen Christians fail so wholly on the concept ""love the sinner hate the sin"" more than on the subject of homosexuality."
1,"In short, yes, it's just your friends.  I know several monogamous homosexuals, and I am an extremely monogamous bisexual (supposedly they don't exist, yet here I am!).  While it may be true that as a population, homosexuals are more promiscuous (and I will not concede that point without current data), that was not the question.  The question is: ""Is Homosexuality a Sin?""  If I answer no, does that automatically mean that doing meth is not a sin, because some gay people do meth?  Of course not.  It's a different question entirely.  For what it's worth, I don't believe any of these things are sin, because I'm an atheist.  Some things are just wrong.  Being who you are is not one of them, unless who you are is a serial killer, etc."
1,"I don't really believe it's just my friends. I would say around 90% of the gay men I have known (and I've lived down the street from San Fransisco, so it's not just a few) have had pretty open relationships. I'm trying very hard not to stereotype here, but it's hard not to when, adversely, all my lesbian friends have been pretty freaking monogamous. You're lucky, in a way, to be an atheist. I've had some good friends who've been steadfastly religious try to deal with their sexuality and it can get quite ugly and distressing for them. It's hard to deal with parents or family who aren't accepting of your choices, but harder still when you yourself have issues with who you are."
1,"Apologies, looking back now that I'm not at work and in a hurry, I was not very clear. My point was, even your friends who are not 100% promiscuous.  ""All gays are slutty"" is the only condition that would make your argument logically correct.  Sorry, I'm a huge nerd about logic.  Let me back it up a bit.  The question asked by this page is ""Is Homosexuality a Sin?""  Your answer (according to my own humble interpretation) breaks down to:""I don't know.  I can't say no, because gays are slutty and god is not a big fan of that. Also, gays can't marry and god doesn't like premarital sex either. If you say yes, I understand, but I cannot say yes myself because I don't like to hate."" That's actually a great, well-reasoned, and honest opinion.  I wish more religious folks had that view.  My point was just that the argument ""A is wrong, most B are A, therefore B is wrong too"" is not logically correct.  What about non-slutty gays?  They do exist, in fact 100% of the gay people in my close social circle are entirely monogamous.  That's because atheist ethics are how I roll, and many friends are like-minded or similar.  The point is, even if promiscuity is correlated to homosexuality, it's not the same thing, and god's condemnation of one does not automatically extend to the other.  As for marriage, the legal governmental form of marriage and the religious ceremony are not the same thing, and their endless confusion is a big problem in our country right now.  Gays can get married in a church.  Surely it's religious marriage, not civil marriage, that god required?  Even if you only count legal marriage, if you believe that premarital sex is a sin, again that is not the same thing as homosexuality.  The vast majority of heterosexuals also have premarital sex.  Using this logic, being an American is a sin.  Our disagreement is a matter of perspective, you're coming from a common-sense point, and I'm coming from a logical view (which is what opposing view is all about for me).  To use an analogy, suppose that giving birth were a sin.  Does that make being a woman a sin?  Most women have children, after all.  As for your comment about reconciling religion with ones lifestyle (which extends to a lot more situations than just homosexuality), amen to that!  Personally, I suspect the antagonistic nature of homosexuality vs. religion in the US is probably a contributing factor as to why homosexuality is so often correlated with promiscuity.  Of course, there are a lot of other factors correlated to promiscuity which are not, as far as I know, labeled sin.  Sorry if I sound antagonistic at all, when it comes to gay rights I just see red sometimes.  I do appreciate how non-judgmental you are :)"
1,"Honestly, the reason I am uncommitted on this argument is because it isn't up to us to decide who the sinners are. And I while I believe whole-heartedly in the existence of God I'm willing to bet he's just about the most chill guy ever. I mean seriously, Jesus comes down, tries to get everyone to chill out and everyone just goes freaking nuts! Plus, if a true Christian reads the bible, they'll notice that God says ""thou shalt not judge, dude"" just about a million times. So who are we to point fingers at homosexuals and say ""sinner""?And you don't sound antagonistic - I understand about the seeing red thing. I hate hearing people talk about prop 8 because most people on either side of the argument just don't know what they're talking about. People refuse to see past what the media portrays (or what they're parents have raised them to believe) and so we have endless discussions of rhetoric and it makes me SO ANGRY. Anyway, I think you and I may have had vastly different experiences when it comes to homosexuality. I have to say, most of my close gay friends come from religious backgrounds and they usually don't differ from my straight friends. So things like the gay parades in San Fransisco, marti gras, and flamboyant drag queens seem to me cliche, and I'm automatically biased against them because I think they do a huge disservice to the face of the gay community.

1,"""Don't ask don't tell"" was stepping stone to gays in the military. John Shalikashvili. ""Second Thoughts on Gays in the Military"". New York Times. January 2, 2007 - ""In the early 1990s, large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians serve. President Bill Clinton, who promised to lift the ban during his campaign, was overwhelmed by the strength of the opposition, which threatened to overturn any executive action he might take. The compromise that came to be known as 'don’t ask, don’t tell' was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time while the culture continued to evolve. [...] The question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration. Much evidence suggests that it has.""

1,"I'm an atheist, so the discussion of whether homosexuality is a sin does not even have a point as far as I'm concerned.  However, completely aside from opinion, the ""logic"" used in this argument is totally absurd.  According to the argument, god first created Adam.  Then he went through all the animals on earth, and none of them were a good mate.  So god created Eve, therefore homosexuality is wrong. QED.  There's only one problem with that.  There were no other men on earth throughout all this.  Therefore god never, ever said ""oh, well, you don't fit with this other dude, either.""  There was only one man on the planet, gay was not even an option for god to dismiss. If you want to believe in god, fine with me.  If you want to use religion to hate others, that's not fine with me, but I respect your right to think whatever you please.  But if you're going to have opinions and make arguments, please think about whether they make sense now that you're not 17.  Hopefully this does not sound rude, but it upsets me when people just parrot things they're taught without thinking critically, and religion is a big source of that.  It hurts society, like ""just following orders."""
1,"how does romans say homosexuality is a sin.(1) homosexuals do not have women..........not from their earliest sexual memories.(2) one cannot abandon something one has never had.(3) natural(dictionary)inclination of being according to personal essence(4) shame based lust....anything shamebased is a about self defilement that causes self hatred and self loathing. anything motivated by lust is committed to satiating the lust. the individuals involved are mere instruments for satiating the lust. there is no commitment between individuals.homosexuals bond out of mutual love, affection, devotion, trust, and respect for a shared committed life together, the same as with heterosexual bonding. it is about self affirmation.to say that romans is about homosexuality, is like saying that orgies are about heterosexual bonding."
1,"Many Christians say   homosexuality   is a choice. Science, logic, common sense, real life accounts, and psychologists all prove this wrong. Any educated Christian or person knows that homosexuality is not a choice. You cannot choose your sexual attractions. They try to use the cop-out that, ""its the behavior"" but that behavior is caused by the initial sexual attraction, which you cannot change. If you feel you can change your sexual attraction, you might want to re-evaluate your sexuality, because you are not straight, but bi-sexual. Now within the group of people that think being   gay   is a choice, they fall in 2 groups.Group 1: The bigots, who try to find any excuse to condone their   discrimination  . Group 2: People who actually are good people, but not informed or know enough about gay people, and thus still think its a choice.I am speaking to group 2 here. Group 1 are bigots that will never change their mind, but that generation will die out like the racist generations. Group 2 read on.-Virtually all major psychological and medical experts agree that sexual orientation is NOT a choice-Most gay people will tell you its not a choice-Common sense will tell you its not a choiceWhile   science   is relatively new to studying homosexuality, studies tend to indicate that its biological.  http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/03/differential-brain-activation.pdf    http://www.newscientist.com/channel/sex/dn14146-gay-brains-structured-like-those-of-the-opposite-sex.html  Gay, Straight Men's Brain Responses Differ  http://www.foxnews.com/story/0  ,2933,155990,00.html  http://www.livescience.com/health/060224_gay_genes.html    http://www.springerlink.com/content/w27453600k586276  /  http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2008/06/16/172  /And it should also be noted that:""It is worth noting that many medical and scientific organizations do believe it is impossible to change a person's sexual orientation and this is displayed in a statement by American Academy of Pediatrics, American Counseling Association, American Association of School Administrators, American Federation of Teachers, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, American School Health Association, Interfaith Alliance Foundation, National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of Social Workers, and National Education Association.""But we don't need scientific evidence for this.(REVERSE THE QUESTIONS IF YOU ARE FEMALE)I shall ask you this. When you see a naked woman, it goes up right? They turn you on emotionally and sexually right? Now how about when you see a naked man? Does your pulse raise in the same way? Are you enjoying it? Do you go up? Do you feel sexual urges in the same way? Do men turn you on emotionally and sexually? Does male/male   porn   turn you on sexually? Would you be able to enjoy sex with a man? Do you find men sexually attractive? Could you be happy sexually with a man for the rest of your life? If you are heterosexual, the answer should be no. Otherwise, you might either be bi-sexual or   homosexual  , and might want to re-evaluate your sexuality. It is well known that a lot of homophobes deny their homosexuality by being aggressive towards it, until they finally accept it. Most people know this is not a choice, and it would be ignorant claiming it so. I know a few gay people who went to a straight club when they were figuring out their sexuality, where women were putting their naked bodies all over them, giving them naked lap dances, not once did the gay men get it up or aroused. But just the picture of a naked guy gets them up easily. Tell me thats choice. Also, why would a gay person, knowing that you will have a rough time in   society  , knowing that you cant get married unless you live in certain places, knowing that people will pick on you for it, knowing that your closest friends and families might completely turn their back on you, choose to be gay, if they could easily be satisfied by the opposite sex? Because they can't. Simple logic there."
2,The   homosexuality   law is there to stop the behavior if you have the attraction like the   murder   law is there to stop the behavior of murdering if you have the urge to kill.

2,"Well said. Too often Christians make homosexual behavior the unforgivable sin. It is not.However, that being said, it is still a sin. The line between law and grace is a tough one to walk, but we must do that nonetheless. There simply are no Scriptural references to homosexuality in a positive light. And the Church has always taught (for nearly 2000 years now) that it is a sin. It is only in our highly sexualized and self-indulgent culture that some people have sought to question that view.Thank you for posting an honest, grace-filled article. And for sharing a touch of  your personal experience."
2," I was very active in the gay comminity for 14 years. There was 4 years I didn't care who I took home from the gay bars.I marched in the gay pride parade, I attended Metropolitian Community Church In time their sunday school department asked me to teach some of their kids. During thids time I met a woman who was willing to help me in the gay sunday school class. Our relationship lasted nine years. We even had the gay marriage. I thought I had the best of everything I could worship God in a gay church, teach kids about Jesus, and love a woman. While I taught SUnday School at the gay church, I asked God to remove my alcohol problem that I had. He took the desire to drink away from me. Later  my lover and I moved from Ca. to Ill. We told the  church we attended we were just sisters. After attending a Louis Palau Cursade in the early '90's, my partner told me she thought our relationship was wrong in God' eyes. I was really taken by surprise,and didn't know what to do. She made plans to move out. I had a choice, but going back to the bars would have been like dying. In my belief that God is bigger than me I began reading the Bible, and asking Him for help.  I met Jesus at the well, in John 4-The Samaritian Woman. I continued to read and seek God's will, I came to the conclusion that homosexuality was a sin in God's eyes, and I asked him to remove it from me, and I repented of my sinful ways. There was peace and healing when I let God be in control. All of us have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God, only when we repent of the sin and ask God for forgiveness can we have peace. In 1 Corinthians 6 there are a list of things that God calls sin. There is also hope, because that is what some of us were. "
2,"""Don't ask don't tell"" is a necessary compromise in a divided country. ""Don't ask don't tell"" was crafted in the early 90s, when the country and the military were deeply divided as to whether gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military. The country remains deeply divided on this question. ""Don't ask don't tell"" strikes an appropriate compromise in this divided environment, avoiding overt approval of homosexuality in the military, while accommodating it.

2,"I grew up a Catholic so I had some convictions about homosexuality. Yet I still practiced it. I was later convicted of it in my early twenties and became a born-again spirit-filled Christian. However, I started to recognize that I wasn't completely over my affections toward men, and though I never engaged in another homosexual relationship or sex since I became born again, I have struggled with it.Having confessed that, I also want to point this out too; I never gave in to the belief that it's okay. I will always continue to fight and resist and struggle to gain the complete victory over those illegitimate feelings. I recognize that Jesus Christ didn't suffer and die so that I can live a life as a slave. He promises that who the Son sets free is free indeed. So there must be a problem on my side and with the way I am doing things, and there has been. I've learned that God's weapons are mightly and capable of pulling down strongholds. Don't compromise on this. That's the first rule. God is committed to your complete deliverence in this life. Believe in Him, that's the second rule.Thirdly, consider yourself dead to your old nature and your carnal nature. Don't obey the lust of your flesh, rather subject yourself to the Spirit of God and live for God.I leave you with this amazing tool and weapon from Romans 6:6""knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin;""  (Rom 6:6)Don't stop here though, go ahead and read all of Romans 6 and consider your beliefs and way of living out your new gift of salvation in Christ Jesus.-God Bless"

1,"The writer for Exodus wrote, ""the biblical definition of “sin” means “to miss the mark” or “to wander from the law of God.""

However, we disagree with Exodus as to what God's law is.There is a difference between God's Law in the Old Testament and God's law in the New Testament isn't there? The New Covenant, that the prophet Jeremiah predicted (Jeremiah 31v31-34), is now in force, and the Mosaic Law no longer applies to Christians. That's why Christians eat pork.But what law does apply. Is it not what the apostle James called ""The Royal law,"" and ""The Law of Liberty"" (James 1v25, 2v8), ""Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.""The Old Mosiac Laws, which were necessary for Israel at the time of Moses, were made redundant after Pentecost. The believer of the gospel is personally redeemed to God, regenerated, and filled with his Spirit, and laws that have nothing to do with love, nothing to do with the Royal law, are no longer relevant.When other Christians lambast me for my long-term committed and faithful relationship with my Partner, I ask them, ""How am I breaking the Royal Law?"""
2,"Dear friend, peace to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.I write to you to convince you of the soundness of the Word of God from its begining to its end beacause it is the word of life and sound truth from God for all men.  ""All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."" (2 Timothy 3:16,17 NIV).  Remember that when this was written to Timothy the only cannonized Scripture available was the Hebrew Tanak and Torah, or Law.  The Apostle Paul clearly considered it inspiried and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteiousness... and so on.  Furthermore, Jesus himself said he did not come to abolish the law but to fufill it.  ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them.  I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practises and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven."" (Matthew 5:17-20, NIV).  Jesus didn't do away with the law but rather fufilled it.  There could be a whole sermon on this but it speaks for itself that the law is not done away with.  As believers in Christ you are right in saying that we are no longer judged by the law but that is not because it is not relavent or useful, but like the Apostle Paul said it is useful and to the Romans wrote: ""So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful."" (Romans 6:12-13, NIV).  The law still reveals what is sinful and as a Christ follower it is not ok to keep on sinning.  THe reality that we live by the Royal law, or the Law of the Spirit of life is that we are free from our sinful nature to yield and follow the Spirit of God who leads us into the way of righteousness, which the Law (Mosaic) defines.  We are not saved by or through the law but by grace through faith but faith is demonstrated in obeidienace and obeidience to God is done through obeying his law.  Jesus said ""If you love me you will obey my commands.""  And remember, Jesus didn't nulify or do away with any of God's law (as given through Moses) but rather fufilled it.  The commands in both the Old and New testaments (covenenents) against the practice of homosexuality are still binding for Christ followers as they were in the beginging of the church.  The good news is that Jesus frees us from our sinful nature and gives us the power through the Spirit of God to put to death the misdeeds of the body and live by the Spirit.  Those who live according to the sinful nature reep death but those who live according to the Spirit, by his power (that is God does it) reep eternal life.  Peace to you, and may the peace of Christ come into every area of the life and convict you of your need for God's help in restoring your whole person and sexuality.  God loves you!"
1,"Hi Periannath,Thanks for your reply and the grace with which it was given. But, Periannath, there is an obvious question that lots of people will be asking you right now - ""Do you eat pork?""If the answer is positive, should you not then admit that something certainly has changed between the Old and New Testaments? Also, is it is vital for you as a teacher to find out what that thing is?I, like you, believe in the inspiration of Holy Scripture. But I also see something dramtic happening at Pentecost, when God's people were placed under a new covenant, and released from the ""tutors and govenors"" of the Mosaic Law (Galations 4v1-5).In Acts 15, the apostles acted decisively against a ""sect of the Pharisees who had believed, saying that it was needful to circumcise them (Christians), and to command them to keep the Law of Moses."" (V5) I have the whole weight of New Testament scripture behind me when I say that Christians no longer need to keep the Mosaic Law.So how then does any Christian explain Jesus' words in Matthew 5v17-20. For me, the answer lies in verse 19, and the phrase, ""the least of these commandments,"" because Jesus wasn't actually referring directly to the Law of Moses with this phrase. Instead, he was referring to the commandments that he was about to utter-  v22, v28, v34, v40, v44; Chapter 6v3, v7, v14, 20, 25; Chapter 7v1. Finally, Jesus sums up the morality that underpins the Mosaic Law, by saying-""So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."" (Chapter 7v12)Jesus didn't come to ""destroy"" the Mosaic Law- that is certain. He came to ensure that the morality that underpins that Law is fulfilled in the believers life. And what is that morality? I have just quoted what Jesus taught about that morality. It correlated exactly with the ""Royal Law"" - ""Love you neighbour as yourself.""How do you think that I break this Royal Law?Lots of love,gaychristian"

2,"Let's observe the truth.Mr. Rick Brentlinger wrote in response to point a):""a) God’s exclusive design of male and female relationships as stated in GenesisGod never says or implies in the Genesis historical account, that his anatomical design of males and females requires ONLY male-female partnerships or that male-male and female-female partnerships draw His wrath""->My objection:Perhaps you missed the fact that Leviticus 20:13(Lev 20:13)  If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.That word translated ""lies with"" is ""shakab"" in the original and all the word scholars interpret it as ""lying down with in affection and sexually"" See Strong's Hebrew and Greek concordance (H7901) and New American Exhaustive Concordance, also Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions. Here another point. The Old Testament is filled with laws governing the sexual relationships between men and women, give me one, just one, instance of God's laws favoring healthy sexual relationships between two men or two women. NONE!!!!! You will never find ONE! Why? Because God doesn't condone any of it. Lev. 20:13.Any other interpretation of God's word to the contrary of Homosexuality as sin is a direct assult on God's moral integrety.Finally, in conclusion, The laws of God are a teacher to expose sin as being truly sinful. Some sins are greater than others and so incurred an immediate death sentence like rape, beastiality, homosexuality, incest, etc. However, there are others that, yet still sinful, don't incur an immediate death sentence like this one;(Deu 22:5)  ""A woman shall not wear man's clothing, nor shall a man put on a woman's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God.""This is were I disagree with J. Buchanan and others who say that no sin is worst than another. That's poor theology. What's true is that all but one sin is forgivable at the cross. Only blaspheme against the Holy Spirit is unforgiveable.Jesus Christ paid for that punishment, but He didn't nullify it's weight of sinfulness. We escape God's wrath by first repenting, and secondly, accepting His atonement, and lastly, living rightly in God's eye's alone, henceforth.Read your bible and stop listening to deceitful men. Jesus promises that all those who sincerely seek the real truth, and who do so with God alone as their source of truth, shall find it. Men(including me) are short sighted and don't hold all truth, we need to seek it from God alone and He will only do it through Jesus Christ (The Word made flesh).Seek verses like, John 8:34, Matt. 5:17-20, Gal. 3:22-24, John 8:34, Rom. 6:6, Luke 9:56 "
1,"To get at the original intent of why the Bible appears to condemn homosexuality, we must take a dive into the Middle Ages.According to William N. Eskridge, Jr. (writing under the Virginia Law Review), ""The early church fathers – most notably Clement, Jerome, Origen, and Augustine – developed a philosophy of sexual abstinency that problematized any sexual activity done for pleasure itself.  But other, non-Christian traditions in Roman society – Stoicism, Neo-Platonism, Manicheanism – similarly urged that 'intercourse was supposed to take place only so as to produce children.  The couple must not make love for the sake of pleasure alone.'""The last sentence is crucial, here.  The couple must not make love for the sake of pleasure alone.  Why?  Because it is selfish and serves no productive purpose for society.  The ideas behind homosexual acts being a sin are the same as heterosexual acts with contraceptives being a sin, or the same as masturbation being a sin.  Pure, selfish pleasure is bad because it is unproductive and turns the focus from helping society to helping one's self.When the Bible condemns homosexuality, it condemns selfishness.  Homosexual love isn't selfish.  Homosexual love is no different from heterosexual love.  Homosexual love represents devotion, affection, trust, respect, all of the same ideals that heterosexual love represents.  True homosexual love is selfless.Don't hate homosexuality.  Hate selfish acts."

2,"You make an error when you state that sins is not abiding by the law... it clearly states that a man shall not lie with a man as with a woman.

2,"Romans 1:24 - Therefore God gave them up in the lust of their hearts to impurity, to the degrading of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the TRUTH of God for a LIE and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed.  For this reason God gave them up to degrading passions.  Their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural, and in the same way also men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another.  Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error.  This is an unnatural lifesytle.. and it states that they exchanged the truth for a lie.  How much more specific could the scriptures be?"
1,"Crash wrote:""This is an unnatural lifesytle.. and it states that they exchanged the truth for a lie.

That Paul is talking about committed, faithful, non-cultic, same sex partnerships in Romans 1:26-27b. That Paul agrees with your twenty first century viewpoint on homosexuality.Paul is not dealing with homosexuality as such in Romans 1. That is not at all his point.

2,"Race and gender are not comparable to gays in the military. Race and gender are more fundamental than sexual orientation.

2,"Let me show you what Romans 1 says:So homosexuality is viewed as ""alright"" in this passage? That definitely is not the case. Here it says: ""For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.""So it states that ""homosexuality"" is not ""NATURAL"" and that the men also received the ""Due Penalty"" for their error (men and women committing ""unatural"" relations with same gender).It then goes onto say: "" 29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.""Here it tells us that those who practiced ""unnatural relations"" with same gender, were filled with unrighteousness, evil, malice, etc. It says they also not only commit all these acts, but give approval to others to do the same. It says the ""God's decree"" to those who practice such things is to ""die.""So again, explain to me.... why is homosexuality not a sin? Do you know what the term sin means. Sin is essentially ""rebellion against God."" If God says that practicing same gender sex is against his decree, which means those who practice are ""rebelling against God's decree,"" therefore that means they are ""sinning."" It is simple logic. "
1,"Dear quiet4no1:Reading into the text what Paul did not say (a universal prohibition of homosexuality) is called eisogesis - wrongly interpreting the text. That kind of faulty interpretation is unworthy of Christians who love the word of God.This Link will assist our mutual understanding of Romans 1.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Against-Nature.html   Paul's words to the Christian community in ancient Rome come from his knowledge of the first century world in which he lived. His carefully tailored argument against idolatry (not lesbianism and not homosexuality) in Romans 1 is set in the specific context of Gentile and Jewish history, complete with first century illustrations familiar to his first century readers.Paul’s readers were intimately acquainted, as we are not, with Greek, Jewish and Roman culture and the shrine prostitution which permeated those ancient cultures.Is it honest to deny the influence of fertility goddess cults which flourished in first century Rome?   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1-And-Homosexuality.html   Paul Talks About Gentile Idolatry In Romans 1, Not Homosexuals And Not Lesbians.""For this cause [idolatry] God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet."" - Romans 1:26-27Idolatry (not lesbianism and not homosexuality) is the hook that catches Gentiles and Jews and allows Paul to declare everyone guilty before a holy God, Romans 3:23.Idolatry, not homosexuality and not lesbianism, is the specific context of Paul's argument in Romans 1.Shrine prostitution is certainly how Paul's first century readers understood his words in Romans 1 and that is how we ought to understand Romans.Rick Brentlinger   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Saved.html   "
2,"Above you have stated that because of idolatry, God gave them unto their vile affections. What were the vile affections? It explains that next: women and men exchanging in unnatural relations with the same gender. The word ""vile"" is defined as:1.  Loathsome; disgusting: vile language.2. Unpleasant or objectionable: vile weather. See Synonyms at offensive.3.a. Contemptibly low in worth or account; second-rate.b. Of mean or low condition.4. Miserably poor and degrading; wretched: a vile existence.5. Morally depraved; ignoble or wicked: a vile conspiracy.Obviously, something that is ""vile"" is not GOOD. In this passage, God gives them over to their own selfish and bad desires (such as homosexuality) because they have committed idolatry. Because God gave them over to homosexuality because of idolatry does not make it ""right."" They were choosing to worship themselves and creatures instead of God, so he gave them over to their other bad desires. The context is about what God did because of men and women idolizing things other than him. He gave them over to their ""foolish,"" ""unnatural,"" and ""vile"" desires. Homosexuality was one of those desires."
2,"It does refer to many parts of Idolatry in Romans 1, but even so it describes same gender sex and attractions as ""vile affections."" That means God did not approve if it was called ""vile."" Another point, ""lusting"" is a sin. If homosexuals are lusting towards another, they are sinning as well.The point I am trying to make, is that ""homosexuality"" is never described as ""good"" in the bible, meaning we should consider not being involved in it. It is considered as vile, impurity (v. 24), to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves (v. 25). He gave them up because they we committing idolatry to many things, including other men and women. Their is due penalty for their error in practicing their lusts for the same gender (v. 26-27). That is why homosexuality is a sin. It involves practicing the ""opposite"" and ""unnatural"" ways that are against the way God created us to function. "
1,"quiet4no1 wrote:[Romans 1] ""describes same gender sex and attractions as 'vile affections.'""In the Bible, there are a number of passages about heterosexual rape - Genesis 34 and Judges 19 and 2 Samuel 13. No thoughtful person would conclude that heterosexuality is wrong based on Bible passages about rape.Just so, no thoughtful person would conclude that committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships are wrong based on a Bible passage about idolatry and shrine prostitution (Romans 1). When pagans engage in same sex activity to worship the fertility goddess, that cultic activity never provides an honest basis to condemn committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex relationships.In reality, your conclusion is at odds with the cultural, doctrinal, historical and scriptural context. The context is shrine prostitution - pagan sexual worship of the fertility goddess - not lesbianism and not homosexuality in the sense of loving, committed, faithful, same sex partnerships.   http://www.jeramyt.org/papers/paulcybl.html   One need not be gay or lesbian to understand that Cybele was THE leading fertility goddess in first century Rome.   http://www.forumancientcoins.com/moonmoth/reverse_cybele.html   The context of Romans 1 is not now and never has been lesbianism or homosexuality.The context of Romans 1 is idolatry and the sexual practices which spring from idolatry.Rick Brentlinger   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-And-Shrine-Prostitution.html   "
2,"Your idea only states you do not believe homosexuality is wrong. You hold the ground that you and only people who believe like you are ""thoughtful."" I guess it is fair to conclude you believe heterosexual rape is ""okay"" ans not a sin as well. You obviously haven't studied the subject of sin period. I have a good link to my page that I wrote, regarding to what sin is, check it out here:    http://innovationapologetics.blogspot.com/2008/09/sin-what-is-it.html   Yes, Romans 1 is talking about idolatry. Because people idolized many things and not God, he gave them over to their ""FOOLISH"" desires: same gender attractions. He also described the same gender relationships as ""vile"" and ""unnatural."" If something is unnatural, it means God did not create it for thaat purpose in nature. So homosexual practices are not something God intended to happen. Something that is considered bad and unnatural by God can not be good. He gave those people who were idolators over to their sinful desires, such as homosexual practices. Yes there was worshipping of sex goddesses. Homosexuality does stem from idolatry, because men and women were idolizing not only sex godesses, but others of the same sex. Unlike other sins, this sexual sin has a judgment administered by God Himself: He gives them over to their passions (Rom. 1:26-28). This means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins. As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance. Without repentance, there will be no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation. Also, a homosexual ""partnership"" would be very sinful regardless, because sex outside of marriage is a ""sin"" and marriage was to be between a man and woman, not two males or two females. I am not judgemental towards homosexuality, as it is just one of many sins, although it can be more emotional and harder to overcome. There are more passages on homosexuality is wrong throughout scripture:1) Lev. 18:22: ""You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination."" 2) Lev. 20:13, ""If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them."" 3)1 Cor. 6:9-10, ""Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals1, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.""

2,"They are never about ""committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex relationships."" That is what you believe correct. So I guess I would have to prove that sex before marriage is a sin first (because it was talking about men and women lying with the same gender). Then I would have to go into detail about how God created man and woman to procreate, not man and man or woman and woman. Finally I would have to show you that a ""Godly"" relationship includes a male and female (not 2 of same gender). This is all evdent from scripture, yet you ignore those points. You told me that Lev. 18:22 is not about those committed relationships between male and male...correct? Yet this is what it states: ""Lev. 18:22: ""You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination."" It states that ANYONE that lies with a male as one lies with a female is an abomination. Lets define abomination: loathsome, hateful, wicked, or vile, forbidden, and unclean.It is telling everyone that no one should lie with the same gender, because it is unclean, forbidden, vile, wicked, etc. So you can't take out those who participate in this act because they are more ""committed"" than others. Christians practicing sex before marriage can not say, ""We are committed, so it must not be sinning."" It is sin no matter how committed we are. Same goes for God's view on homosexuality.1 Corinthians 6:9 - the word you gave me, Arsenokoitai, translates in the Greek as a ""sodomite: one who practices sodomy."" ""Sodomy is a term used today predominantly in law (derived from traditional Christian usage) to describe the act of anal intercourse, oral intercourse, as well as bestiality. When used in a religious context, it has a negative connotation (wikipedia).""In many translations, the word is translated as ""effeminate"" which according to Merriam-Webster, its defined as: ""having feminine qualities untypical of a man : not manly in appearance or manner.""That would mean that any man who ""has feminine qualities untypical of a man, and that does not act in a manly manner nor look like one in appearance, shall not inherit the kingdom of God. The reason it is translated as ""homosexual"" is because the word ""effeminate"" describes a homosexual man. It also says those who practice this lifestyle of sodomy, which is exactly what homosexuals do, correct? **You need to either rebuttal me with your own words and beliefs, not 20 web pages that I am not going to read.

There are many great organizations, such as Courage, which help men and women to live chaste lives in spite of their same-sex attractions.

They happily do this for many other rules and sins in the bible that are quietly sidelined as no longer relevant to today - for example, women as chattels of men, the nationality of slaves, the correct ways of killing various animals, etc. Yet they fixate on gays and lesbians - who really just wish to be left alone.I am a gay man in Sydney, Australia, in a committed homosexual relationship that brings me the most amazing love, joy and fulfillment. I have the blessing of my whole family - because they see how happy I am with my partner, who is a beautiful, loving and faithful man. I have never used drugs and my many days of charity work extend to all parts of my community, not just HIV/AIDS. I try to give to society as much as I've received from it. I have many friends of all kinds and ages - including my wonderful parents - and my life is rich and free. I refuse to believe that any god would not wish this for all people. Everyone, regardless of their sexuality, should be able to live like this. The bible, the koran, or any other religious tome that is no more than the word of men, should not be used to clobber the rights of those who find the interference of religious obsessives totally inexplicable."
2,Adultery is sex outside of marriage and a homosexual relationship active in sex is outside of marriage and therefore adultery.The overriding intent of scripture regarding relationship structure is that marriage is between opposite genders.  Our manmade laws that define marriage otherwise cannot stack up to scripture . . . that is if we accept that scripture is God inspired.Sex between two people of the same gender is no worse in God's eyes than two people of opposite gender having sex outside the covenant relationship of holy matrimony.  That basically makes us all guilty of sinning.  I thank God for His grace and patient love for all those who seek it.
1,"then Christians believe it is sin unless it is inconvenient for them to do so. Why focus on homosexuality as a sin when there are scores of laws laid down in Leviticus and elsewhere in the Bible that hardly anyone pays attention to anymore? You're right to make this distinction between cultic and committed relationships, but I think there's a bigger point about defining sin. Why would an openly homosexual person be denied the Eucharist whereas there would be no problem with, for example, someone wearing two different kinds of fabric at once? It's a silly and arbitrary distinction as far as the Bible is concerned."
2,"I feel terrible that people who have same sex attractions feel condemned by the church. All of us are sinners - period. All of us are made worthy by God - period.The notion of ""sin"" has taken on strange nuances that have become bigger than what I believe God intended. While sin does separate us from God, >Christ< bridged the gap, not our good behavior. (See Christianity 101.)So none of this conversation should lead to anyone thinking that homosexuals are unworthy of taking Eucharist. The whole point of that ritual is to remember that we are forgiven, for crying out loud!The purpose of paying attention to what God tells us is ""sin"" is to a) keep ourselves and our community out of harm's way, and b) help lead us toward God's plan for our lives which are to give us hope and a future. (Jeremiah 29:11-13) "
2,"I have re-read the passages in Leviticus with Rick's interpretation in mind that this was solely about types of sex that happened at the shrine - with the notion that perhaps God is not addressing sexual relations that happen within a monogamus loving relationship. What's interesting to me is that Lev 18 lists all kinds of prohibitions: no sex with your relatives; no sex with your neighbor, no sex with someone of the same gender; but it doesn't prohibit sex with your heterosexual spouse. It seems to me that if we were to discount what Lev 18 says on the basis that it was God prohibiting any kind of idolatrous sex ritual, we would see the inclusion of sex with your heterosexual spouse.It seems to me that God is giving instruction for a broader context."
2,"Contrary to many beliefs that homosexuality is not a sin, I would have to disagree. Homosexuality is much like any sin: lying, stealing, coveting, idolatry, etc. I realize it is a controversial topic in today's society, but it doesn't mean we can ignore the word of God. One thing I do disagree with is: the way homosexuals are treated by Christians and the church. We are all sinners, like Romans 3:23 says: ""for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" We must understand that homosexuality is a sin, like 1 Corinthians 6:9 says: ""Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality.""The one thing Christians do tend to do is to judge harshly, the homosexuals. I do not believe this should happen. Homosexuality is just one of many sins, and we all sin daily, no matter who we are. Those of us who recognize this and have asked Jesus for forgiveness will be forgiven, but those who dwell and live in sin will not inherit the kingdom of God. I do know many Christians that struggle with homosexuality, but we should encourage them to listen to God's voice. I do believe many homosexuals will and have gone to heaven, those who truly have a relationship with God and try to obey his commandments. On a tighter note, I do stand at the point: homosexuality is still a sin. "
2,"The argument that sexuality is determined innately from birth, may be true, but there is a problem with those who want to rape children, have many spouses, murder and so on. Although it seems extreem to use these as examples, many years ago no one would have dreamed in our society that Homosexuals could be married here in the US. It was against the law to practice homosexuality, as it is now against the law to have sex with children and other sexual acts. To be true to yourself, the philosphy of Jean paul Sarte, Existencialism, I believe breaks down when considering that some are born with sociopathic tendencies, and sexial deviencies, homosexuality may be one and we have just chosen to allow it out of compassion. Who doesn't love these people, they are wonderful, but their activities are not. Do what you feel or be what you are is not necessarily the best activity, so we must talk about the argument for homosexuality on another foundation. Thank you for your comments. "

2,"Jesus is very clear on the proper marriage relationship (Matthew 19:4-5). ""For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and cling to his wife and the two shall become one flesh."" There can be no mistaking what Jesus taught in this regard. In this passage Jesus is reiterating what Moses taught (Genesis 2:24) about marriage and family. Anything contrary to this-any sexual relationship outside of a committed marriage relationship between one man and one woman-demeans the institution of marriage and is unbiblical. There are those who like to say that the Bible does not condemn   homosexuality  . Various verses are cited (out of context) and the verses that people use to show that homosexuality is wrong are explained away. The world wants to change God’s words and meanings into something more suitable to its sinful desires. Nevertheless, the truth stands: The Bible condemns homosexuality as a sin. Let’s look at what it says.Lev. 18:22, “You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.” Lev. 20:13, “If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them” 1 Cor. 6:9-10, “Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.” Verse 11 says ""and such WERE some of you.. but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.""(Notice the past tense, WERE!  When they came to Christ, He changed them from the inside out.  It can happen I have seen it happen!  Rom. 1:26-28, “For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper.”Homosexuality is clearly condemned by the Bible. It goes against the created order of God. He created Adam and then made a woman. This is what God has ordained and it is what is right. Unlike other sins, homosexuality has a severe judgment administered by God Himself. This judgment is simple: They are given over to their passions. That means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins (Romans 1:18ff). As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance and trusting in Jesus. Without Jesus, they will have no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation.It is mentioned 5 times in Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments.  So it is not a cultural thing!  Nor is it, as Rick B. is trying to say, just a cultural thing that Paul was dealing with.  It is an issue of morality, one in which Jesus did not erase!  The Old Testament dietary laws and sacrificial laws were completed in Christ.  However the moral laws were never abolished.  Other places do mention what the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was.  (Jeremiah 23:14) Some may ask, ""Why should we arbitrarily select only heterosexual couples for marriage? What can it hurt if two homosexuals want to marry?"" The answer is surprisingly simple. The institution of marriage between and man a woman is not, in fact, arbitrary. It's purpose is clear and of utmost importance to society. Mentioned 5 times in both Old and New Testaments, called an abomination, unnatural, lustful, perverse, it is no wonder that the person who commits such and does not repent of that sin will not enter heaven! You can't have Jesus and homosexuality also.  The two do not mix, like   oil   and water. God's word is final in all matters, not history! "
2,"God's word is final, true, however, you cannot take this and run with it.  History is relevant in understanding what God's word actually is.  Without context, ""God's word"" is meaningless, or worse, it could be used for antithetical pursuits.  "
2,"While history is important and plays an important role in our understanding of what happened in the past and why people of other cultures act as they do, it is not the final authority, and you agree with me on that. The Bible is the final authority and it remains the final authority in all matters of faithand practice.   I was not saying that history is not important or relevant.  I was saying that in intrepreting the Bible, history should not be used where it contradicts the Word of God. If we use history alone to intreprite the Bible, then we are in trouble!  Our histories are packed with immorality, fornication,   murder  , sexual abuse, and so forth.   If we use these actions as standards for verifying the truth of the Bible, then we depend on man's inhumanity to man to explain God's love for man.  It cannot be done. We need to use the histories to understand what God means by what He says.  However we cannot allow history to dictate to us what God meant by what He said in His Holy Word.  His word is final and not even history can make God's word mean what it was never meant to.That is all I was saying.  Let history interprite history and let the Bible intreprite the Bible.

2,"History is important and I will agree to that.  However history cannot determine what the Word of God means.  You are correct,  without context, the Word od God is meaningless, which is why we need to keep it in its context and allow the Bible to be its own interpriter.  History cannot be the interpriter of God's word any more than God's word can be the intrepriter of history.   They are separate and distinct and both, while valuable, have nothing to do with one another, at least secular history.  God's word is inspired; history is not.    If we use history as a leverage, then the evil things that happened in human history become important and relevant when we try to interprite the word of God.  If we allow the Word of God to be its own interpreter, then we are on solid ground.  "
2,"This argument relies on an unwarranted assumption: ""Both are innate orientations"" and then moves on to cite an individual whose opinion does nothing to substantiate the assumption as his credibility to augment the assumption is invalid.  Proof by association is specious at best. Proof by inapplicable analogy is flawed. Your conclusion that '  homosexuality   is no more a sin than heterosexuality' does not follow from any of the evidence you cite.  "
2,"I agree that it is not right to demonize gays as an entire group, or to try to portray ALL gays and lesbians as having participated in the horrible behaviors that are alluded to here.However, sin is not sin because it involves things that  we  deem to be negative. The bottom line for Believers and followers of Christ is that sin is what God says it is. Therefore, as far as the question of sin is concerned, it does not matter if gays and lesbians are monogamous or promiscuous, whether they are abusive or kind to one another. Obviously one is worse than the other in a practical sense, but since we can agree promiscuity and other misbehaviors are not characteristic of homosexuality, their presence or absence is not what makes homosexuality right or wrong.If you are a follower of Christ, in order to believe that homosexual behavior is not a sin, you must believe that the Bible is fundamentally flawed and that this secret has been hidden from God's people for all of recorded history. Every mention of homosexuality in the Scriptures clearly calls it a sin--both in the Old and New Testaments. There is no example of a homosexual relationship or behavior that is  not  called sin. No one can say that homosexuality is an expression of God's design without contradicting God's Word.You'd have to accept that despite the revelations God gave to the Biblical authors, He was never able to get past their homophobia throughout thousands of years--until this enlightened generation came along and discovered what God  really  said--nevermind that it happens to be perfectly in line with the direction of secular Western culture. The Bible says a lot about that, too.""..I say it again with tears in my eyes, that there are many whose conduct shows they are really enemies of the cross of Christ.They are headed for destruction. Their god is their appetite..."" Philippians 3:18-19God's Word is not always convenient for us where we find ourselves, but He is the only one who is good and we can trust Him with our lives--and our sexuality. I struggle with homosexuality and submitting that to God is not always easy or convenient for me--but God has the right to demand obedience that goes against my nature. Which He demands of us all, by the way.""anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.

1,"The Bible, in it's original language and context, doesn't even address homosexuality as we know it today...much less condemn it.The bottom line here is that most Christians still use all the old arguments about the Bible condemning homosexuality when it has been proven, time and again, that isn't the case.  I live a vibrant Christian life and have a wonderful relationship with my Lord Jesus Christ.  I also live a wonderful life with my female partner of 15 years, who is also a committed Christian.

Case in point...  My grandparents were Deaf.  When they were growing up, being Deaf was considered the same as being mentally retarded.  They were abused and treated as though they were stupid and not worth a whole lot to society.  Now, we've learned a lot about deafness and have come to understand that it isn't something that has anything to do with mental dificiency.  There are some great minds that are located in people who cannot hear.  That's just one example.

1,"Seems to me that the bible has a few verses that support homosexual relationships:In Samuel 20:41, Jonathan and David kiss each other. When Jonathan dies in battle, David conveys his love for Jonathan when he says, in 2 Samuel 1:26: “I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother! Most dear have you been to me; your love more wonderful to me surpassing the love of women.” (copied/pasted from an article by Irene Morgan)Does it boil down to how one interprets the book?It seems to me God deliberately made homosexuality; perhaps as a way to teach people love and acceptance for all.  It's too bad the vast majority of ""christians"" are failing badly, and most seem to want to ""judge not lest thee be judged.""  Shame on the bigots."
2,"first off, both david and johnathan were married - they weren't gay.second, it was common for people to greet one another back then with a kiss (paul even suggests it in 1 corin 16:20).  look at judas and Jesus ... judas gave Jesus a kiss before he betrayed the Son of GOD.  does that mean that both were (are) gay?  bring it into today's standards, if i kiss my son does that make us both gay?  or how about if i give a simple kiss (peck on the cheek) to my best friend - as david and johnathan did - does that make us gay?  no.  it just means that i have a dear affection for my best friend (and my son).  it means that these men in my life mean a lot to me - that i value their relationship.  how about when certain ethnic groups greet each other with a kiss; are they all gay too.  this is not a good argument for the pro-gay side.and here's another thought, i will listen and understand someone's argument that homosexuality isn't spoken against in the Bible (even though i do believe it is).  so the greek may be misrepresented and misunderstood (though i don't believe it is).  still though, one question comes up time and time again for me:  where in scripture does GOD say that homosexuality is right?it seems to me that whenever GOD talks about marriage, it's always between a man and a woman.  whenever GOD talks about lusting after another, the issue is between a man and a woman.  whenever GOD talks about parents raising kids, it's between a man and a woman.buckeyenutlover, you state that ""GOD deliberately made homosexuality"" ... but if HE did, wouldn't you think that HE would have stated positive reasons for it - and not just negative ones?some things to ponder."
1,"well, we all know the bible has been ""edited"" throughout the years (i.e. the book of judas).  perhaps all the pro-homosexuality references were deleted to justify the extremist position against homosexuality. prior to the printing press, it was left to scribes to copy the bible and we all know what can happen when different hands lay claim on text.and when david conveys his love for jonathan as ""more than any women"" I guess you should vilify david for the sin against his marriage, eh?  oh, guess not, since you have such a narrow interpretation.let's not forget there's many married men ""of god"" who are gay.  just look at ted haggerd.  unfortunately, when people scream about homosexuality, it tends to force other people in the closet.god loves everyone.  to suggest homosexuality is more of a sin than shaving is ridiculous, and cherry-picking what you think is sin and what is not simply shows that you're defying god...judge not lest ye be judged."

GOD doesn't hate me (the sinner) but HE does hate my sin.  this is truth - its all throughout scripture.when i speak, i am not judging you (or homosexuals) in the way that you are referring to (judge not lest ye be judged).  i do suggest though that you know the scripture before you use it against someone.  what Jesus is talking about is judging people from a hypocritical spirit/mindset - basically being self-righteous.  here's an example:  if i condemned you for sinning and said that you needed to be perfect like me, that would be judging like we're not suppose to.  because i'm not perfect.  but if i called you out on a sin, acknowledging that i too need accountability in my life for sins, than i am not judging.in fact if you are a christian, i have a right to call you out on doing something wrong just like you have a right to call me out (1 corinthians 5:12, proverbs 27:17).if you are not a christian - which i am not saying you are either way, cause i don't know - but if you're not, and you are offended by what i have written, i am sorry for offending you.  its not my intent to argue (nor am i arguing) - though i also will not back down from defending the truth.i have spent many years within this issue.  i feel confident about where i stand and where to draw the line between fact and fiction.  and by the way, i would appreciate you answering my questions, if you wouldn't mind.  thanks."

2,"sorry for taking so long rick - i tried to post a response earlier, but wasn't able to do so for some reason.  so i will try and remember what i said in my last response this time around.i hear what you're saying about david and jonathan, and i have heard these arguments before, but i just am not convinced that this particular situation is talking about two gay guys.here's how i understand the story of these two guys: david and jonathan were two devoted friends who loved each other - and were even willing to die for each other.  i too have a love for my best friend (pete) who i would die for if asked to.  i love the guy.  but it's not in a homosexual way, as you allude to between david and jonathan.also, when they are weeping with each other, it's at a time when david and jonathan are going separate ways - most likely never to see each other again.  david was running for his life, cause jon's dad wanted to kill him - not to mention kill jonathan too.  no wonder they both were crying ... wouldn't you?  i know when i moved to another state from pete, we both wept.  we both embraced.  we both kissed each other goodbye and said 'i love yous'.  same was done when pete moved to africa for awhile.  there's nothing gay about those situations.  i just don't see the connection.i have read your comments else, so i know you are schooled in this subject, as am i.  i also am sure that i won't be able to convince you of my belief, just as i'm sure you won't be able to convince me of yours.  though we can agree to disagree, i can still be civil to you.  i don't think arguing is going to get anyone anywhere in this issue.  truth has been presented from both sides, giving support by their own experts.in the end only one truth will stand to be correct.you ask me to give you scripture that condemns ""a committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnership"", and well i can't do that because there aren't any verses.  in fact there aren't any positive verses about homosexuality anywhere in the bible - only ones calling it a sin.  i am under the belief and conviction that the verses you listed above are in fact in context and speak out against homosexuality (even ""committed and faithful"" relationships of such).as i asked the above poster before me, where does GOD approve of homosexuality in the Bible?  so far no one has answered that question.  i think its a valid one to be asked and should be answered.  whenever GOD speaks about marriage, parenting, or even men lusting with their eyes, it is always between a man and a woman.  wouldn't you think that if GOD 'made people gay' and allowed them to be gay that HE would have spoken about such relationships in the Bible - positively and not just negatively?thanks for the conversation."

It is alleged to be a story condemning homosexuality in the strongest fashion possible. If homosexuality is wrong, we would expect the Bible to say so in some of the 48 places where Sodom is mentioned in the Bible. Instead, we discover that wherever Sodom is mentioned in the Bible, homosexuality is not mentioned or condemned.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Sin-of-Sodom.html   If I cited Genesis 34 (a passage about heterosexual rape) as a proof text against heterosexuality, you would contend that its wrong to take a passage about rape and based on that passage, condemn heterosexuality.Yet Exodus and most anti-gay Christians feel no remorse in using a passage about attempted violent rape as a proof text that homosexuality is wrong.In the Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 portion of the Holiness Code, God carefully places His proscription of male male sex in the context of pagan worship, Lev 18:3, taking care to mention Molech in Lev 18:21, just before prohibiting male male sex in Lev 18:22.In the Leviticus 20:13 passage, we find the same context. God carefully mentions and forbids Molech worship in Lev 20:2, 3, 4, 5 and then prohibits male male sex in Lev 20:13 and then reiterates the pagan worship context in Lev 20:23.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Leviticus.html   *******************************I wonder then, what informs your ""belief and conviction"" that the Bible speaks against homosexuality, even ""committed and faithful"" relationships? How did you get convicted to believe something the Bible does not say?*******************************You asked, Where does God approve of homosexuality in the Bible?I believe God approves of committed, faithful, non-cultic, same sex partnerships in the true story of the 15 year committed relationship Jonathan and David enjoyed, I Samuel 18 - II Samuel 9.Of course most scriptures about marriage partnerships deal with the 95% norm. For the other 5%, exclusive, same sex marriage partnerships between two men or two women were NOT the norm in Biblical times. Therefore, there was no reason to address the issue of gay marriage in the Bible, just as there was no reason to address the issue of nuclear energy back then. six11 wrote:""if GOD 'made people gay' and allowed them to be gay...

He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.”Jesus does speak positively about ""born eunuchs."" A ""born eunuch"" is someone who was born without the desire for opposite sex marriage in the Adam and Eve model and Jesus specifically exempts ""born eunuchs"" from the Adam and Eve marriage paradigm.The leading anti-gay evangelical, Dr. Robert Gagnon, admits that:""Probably ""born eunuchs"" in the ancient world did include people homosexually inclined...""   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Eunuchs-Are-Gay.html   I'm enjoying our conversation."

2,"hey rick,my bad for the long wait.  i've had some pressing 'youth ministry' issues that i needed to attend to.  anyways, let's carry on this conversation.in regards to your question about sodom ... just because the word ""homosexual"" doesn't always accompany the passages about sodom's sin, doesn't mean that it wasn't apart of sodom's downfall.  notice that i say 'apart'.  i agree with you that homosexuality wasn't the only sin that brought destruction upon the city, but it definately played its role.  i read your comments about how JESUS never said anything about homosexuality and sodom, so therefore the sin of sodom had nothing to do with homosexuality.  i totally disagree with you.  i think that the homosexual sin was well known to people, so HE didn't have to explain it.  when people spoke of sodom, they connected the sin of homosexuality to it.  i can see JESUS talking about the other sins within the town more so because these sins were often overlooked, as 'petty issues' so to say, just as they still are in most american churches today.jude 1:7 connects sodom with 'sexual immorality' - which includes homosexual relationships: In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.  (   http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=Sodom&version1=31&searchtype=all&limit=none&wholewordsonly=no   )here's a question i have with your argument.  knowing that several other towns/cities were rude and had horrible towards GOD'S messengers, why didn't GOD also destroy those places as well?  you state in your article that, ""The sin of Sodom, according to Jesus, was inhospitality to God’s messengers.""  but if this is true, then why didn't GOD destroy Jerusalem because the Jews rejected the messages of the disciples.  why didn't GOD destroy every other place that rejected HIS messengers?in speaking about the passages of scripture used to call homosexuality as sin - especially Leviticus - all i can say is that GOD'S word is GOD'S word.  the natural order GOD set up in the beginning was male and female, and the charge for them was to produce offspring.  i do believe that those verses of homosexuality do condemn it mostly because it went totally against the created order GOD established over us.  regardless if it's pagan worship or committed same-sex relationships, is still against what GOD set into place.in addition to this, there are several other times when GOD talks about things being an abomination (toevah) that are not connected to idol worship, such as Proverbs 6:16-19.  as joe dallas notes in his book a strong delusion, ""the prohibitions against homosexuality in Leviticus appear alongside other sexual sins ... which are forbidden in both [testaments] ... [these references] show GOD'S displeasure with them whether or not any ceremony or idolatry is involved"" (193).  he also makes another point stating that if these other practices only pertained to idol worship, then child sacrifice, adultery, incest, and the like would all be permissible as long as it was done apart form idol worship.  rick, that's exactly what you're suggesting as well.  outside of 'idol worship' is incest a sin?  what about adultery?  child sacrifice?again, you mention about david and jonathan and their 'same-sex' relationship.  i think we beat that issue over the head enough times.  if both men were gay, explain the wives they had - was their 'gayness' like a light switch?  it doesn't make sense.you stated:  For the other 5%, exclusive, same sex marriage partnerships between two men or two women were NOT the norm in Biblical times.well if this is correct, my question is why wasn't it the norm back then?  if there was nothing wrong with homosexuality, even back in the day, why wasn't it a norm just like every other couple in a committed relationship?  i think it wasn't the norm because everyone knew it was a sin!  yeah, JESUS never spoke about it, so the 'silence argument' can be used, but then again i can use the same argument - JESUS never accepted the lifestyle either.  never!**************************************************************************you asked me why i have a deep conviction of this topic and where i stand on.  my conviction simply comes from years of studying this subject by pouring over scripture, reading books (from both sides), praying, and other things.this past august marked an 8 year journey out of homosexuality.  up until that point, i was very active in 'the life', even at one time being engaged to a man (i am 30 now).  my convictions are born out of what GOD has done within my life and the revelation HE has given me through HIS word by HIS Spirit.  like i said before, this is my conviction."

1,"I agree with you that Saul's vulgar sexual characterization of the Jonathan and David relationship does not prove that J & D had a sexual relationship. I make that statement in my book, Gay Christian 101.On the other hand, Saul's statement provides contemporary eye witness testimony about the sexual intimacy of their partnership, from a man who knew both men.And the fact that the Holy Spirit chose to include Saul's testimony in the text of scripture raises an interesting question.If God is as anti-gay as He is alleged to be, why does He include in scripture, this LONG story, chapter after chapter, detailing the loving, intimate, committed partnership of Jonathan and David?  http://www.gaychristian101.com/David-and-Jonathan.html  There is more in the Bible about the Jonathan and David partnership than about the creation of the universe.Scripture vividly contrasts the loving, committed partnership of Jonathan and David with the failed marriage of David and Princess Michal and with the violent, murderous relationship between King Saul, David and Jonathan. Saul tried to kill both David and Jonathan.Certainly you are correct that two men can have an intimate friendship without being sexual.

1,"Hey there,I have two problems with the view that David was gay.  Firstly the Bible never says David and Jonathan ""lay together"", which supports the cultural view that D&J were not a couple.  If the Holy Spirit REALLY wanted to say that same-sex sex is okay, surely telling us D&J had sex would have been the simplest way to say so?  My second problem is a larger than life woman called Bathsheba (2 Sam 11).  Surely if David was gay, his adultery would have been to   murder   her, and chase Uriah, her husband?!  His actions with her are VERY inconsistent with those of a gay man, aren't they?  Just a thought... :-)"
1,"------- ""Firstly the Bible never says David and Jonathan ""lay together"", which supports the cultural view that D&J were not a couple."" -------God (not gays) chose to emphasize the David and Jonathan story in the Bible, chapter after chapter. This exceptional love story receives major emphasis because God the Holy Spirit, the ultimate Author of scripture, intended to give it major emphasis.The Holy Spirit spends more time describing the love relationship between David and Jonathan than He spends describing David and Michal’s heterosexual marriage. The Bible never so extravagantly and extensively describes a heterosexual marriage relationship.David and Princess Michal's partnership was an arranged marriage while David and Crown Prince Jonathan's partnership clearly involved mutual love.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Jonathan-Loved-David.html  I believe this story, part of Hebrew scripture for three thousand years, is God’s way of encouraging the modern Christians to affirm faithful, committed gay partnerships. Will modern Christians listen to God?------- ""My second problem is a larger than life woman called Bathsheba (2 Sam 11). Surely if David was gay, his adultery would have been to   murder   her, and chase Uriah, her husband?! His actions with her are VERY inconsistent with those of a gay man, aren't they?"" -------Interesting point, Gay Christian. It helps our understanding if we keep the timeline in mind. At the time of the Bathsheba incident, Crown Prince Jonathan has been dead for many years.The fifteen year partnership between Jonathan and David ended with Jonathan's untimely death in battle. By necessity, David has moved on, taking heterosexual wives, as ancient Kings did, to produce offspring who will inherit his kingdom.Yet remember David's testimony about Jonathan, given years earlier as a eulogy before David's mighty army.""I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant have you been to me: your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women."" -2 Samuel 1:26  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Gay-Couples-In-The-Bible.html  "
2,"   Your argument only takes in God's mercy and ignores His justice. Given your point of view why would Jesus need to go to the cross? Homosexuality is a sin as any other sexual sin. No different then adultery, fornication, internet porn or premarital sex. Many who look at this argument are stressing a point of perception that the gay and lesbian community and those who support them are trying to incorporate into American culture. God's righteous doesn't change to meets today's modern opinions. He does not condemn the homosexual from eternal life through repentance just as he doesn't bar the theft or internet porn addict, so long as they repent. None of us are permitted a ""Mulligan"", a sin we are allowed to engage in that is shielded from which God asks us to repent.    The most difficult ideal for gay and lesbian Christians to accept is their active engagement in their lifestyle is asked by the Father to be left at the Cross. Many liberal Christians have developed a pick and chose mentality of Christian faith and it has led many astray. V. Gene Robinson is a classic example, how can one lead a flock while being actively engaged in his most deep rooted sin. It engulfs his entire flock, they thus become embroiled in the entire debate of sexual sin, instead of growing in Christ. Sadly this has shielded active sinners into a false sense of security as they believe they are right with God, when actually they are in bondage to the one thing they won't give to Him. I tell you would a homosexual say it is ok to strike a brother, NO. Would he allow a child to be sexually abused, NO. Thus homosexuals pointing out that they don't live any more differently then straights, means nothing. Because some homosexuals display behavior openly means little, sin is sin whether out in the open or behind closed doors."
2,"People have used the Bible to support many false teachings and agendas.  It has been used to defend polygamy, Aryanism, racism, slavery, crusades, and the oppression of women.  Just because scriptures have been used out of context and manipulated in the past by people with harmful and wicked agendas does not invalidate their veracity.  For our ancestors to use scripture to defend the institution of American slavery was to use scripture out of context.  In the same way, to use scripture to defend the acceptability of homosexual behavior is to use it out of context.  I appreciate the quote by George MacDonald:  ""To give truth to him who loves it not is only to give him more plentiful material for misrepresentation.""The point has been made by many that Christ never said anything condemning homosexuality.  However, there is also an absence of biblical condemnation of slavery.  In fact, it gave regulations for slaves and slave owners (slavery during Greco-Roman era was vastly different than the atrocity of Western-European and American slavery).  This line of thinking was used by slave owners to justify their position which contradicted the biblical doctrine of man.  If there is a parallel in this discussion of homosexuality, it is the use of the same strategy to justify homosexual behavior.    This argument and other arguments regarding the issues surrounding slavery cannot be effectively utilized in defending homosexuality.  The major difference is that there are multiple scriptural references condemning homosexual behavior.  People cannot defend sexual practices clearly condemned by biblical teaching in the same way as our “pro-slavery” Christian ancestors may have done in defending slavery.  There cannot be the claim that the Bible actually affirms this practice and offers no condemnation of it.  Therefore, to claim that scripture is being used to promote the condemnation of homosexuality in the same manner as it was to promote the establishment of American slavery is invalid.  "
1,"In his 520 page book, THE BIBLE AND HOMOSEXUAL PRACTICE, anti-gay evangelical Christian activist, Dr. Robert Gagnon, devotes more than ten pages to proving his assertion that ""homosexual shrine prostitution"" was the primary form of homosexual activity in ancient Israel.So there's no misunderstanding, Dr. Gagnon is adamantly against every kind of homosexual relationship. That's why his opinion about the prevalence of shrine prostitution in ancient Israeli is so startling.When the leading anti-gay evangelical Christian activist admits in print, that gay Christians are right (that the context of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 is shrine prostitution), we have already won a major part of the argument. Carefully note what Dr. Robert Gagnon says.“I do not doubt that the circles out of which Lev 18:22 was produced had in view homosexual cult prostitution, at least partly. Homosexual cult prostitution appears to have been the primary form in which homosexual intercourse was practiced in Israel."" - Gagnon, p. 130""There is good evidence of homosexual cult prostitution in Israel during the period of the divided monarchy.” p. 100.The [Hebrew] term [qedesim/qades] denotes “men at cult sites who engaged in homosexual prostitution: male temple (or cult, shrine, sacred) prostitutes.” p. 101.Qedesim “...one of whose cultic functions was to offer their bodies to other men for same-sex intercourse.” p. 102.“two other occurances of qedesa in the Bible (Gen 38:21-22; Hos 4:14) also link it with the term zona, “prostitute, harlot.”p. 103. Homosexuality wrong?“The remark in I Kgs 14:24 that the people of Judah “conformed their behavior to all the abominations (toebot) of the nations which Yahweh dispossessed” sounds remarkably like the summary in Lev 18:24-30, which followed a listing of sexual offenses that singled out in particular same-sex male intercourse as an “abomination.”” p. 103.“the same-sex role of the assinu, kugarru, and kuluu (who, owing to castration, were certainly unsuitable partners for heterosexual intercourse and impregnation) does provide good evidence for homosexual cult prostitution.” p. 104.“The harsh descriptions of the qedesim in I-2 Kings (I Kgs 14:24: “even qades were in the land”) and Job 36:14, along with the epithet of “dog” in Deu 23:18, suggests a degree of revulsion more suited to same-sex male cult prostitution.” p. 104.“That means Josiah’s action against the qedesim in the temple precincts was likely taken as a direct result of laws in Deut 23:17-18 regarding the qedesim or “dogs.”” p. 106.“It can hardly be denied that... (the author of Job 36:14) regarded the qedesim as homosexual cult prostitutes.” p. 108.“Cult association is established by the name “holy/consecrated ones” and by the connection to Asherah. The element of prostitution is clear from Deut 23:17-18 (fees for services rendered) and the connection to qedesot, who elsewhere are identified as harlots.” p. 108. Homosexuality wrong?“The same-sex dimension is suggested by the label “dogs,” by history of religion parallels, and by the unlikelihood of male heterosexual prostitution.” p. 108.“The existence of homosexual shrine prostitutes in Judah was a recurring problem.” Dr. Robert Gagnon, p. 110.""Its not gay people who are taking the Bible out of context. Its the Christian anti-gay activists who take the Bible out of context."

1,"For me, the most consistent, honest understanding of all the clobber passages is that the Bible is addressing shrine prostitution, not committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships.That being so, there are NO Biblical passages which condemn committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships.Only by taking the clobber passages out of their cultural, doctrinal, historical, linguistic and religious context can they be made to condemn two gay men who love each other or two lesbian women who love each other and want to spend their lives together.Talking to anti-gay Christians can be frustrating because they ping pong back and forth between equally inconsistent arguments.They will admit that, in context, none of the clobber passages is NOT talking about committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships.Then they ping pong back to their Complementarian argument, that since God originally created Adam and Eve, that ""proves"" God could never affirm Adam and Steve.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/adam-and-eve.html  When it is pointed out that Adam and Eve (one man with one woman for life) did NOT indicate God's prohibition of polygamy (notice Genesis 4:19 where the first polygamous marriage occurs and Deuteronomy 21:15 where God makes provision for inheritance in polygamous marriage situations) anti-gay Christians then ping pong back to the clobber passages and opine that it is ""clear"" that God is talking about homosexuality, even though they previously admitted that the context is shrine prostitution, NOT a committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnership.Ah, the joys of debating the Bible with the brethren...Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Mission.html  "
1,"I disagree with your reasoning in a number of areas.First, you have simply reworded (however inadvertently) the anti-gay viewpoint of Robert Gagnon which asserts that scripture condemns every same sex partnership without distinguishing between committed faithful non-cultic partnerships and shrine prostitute couplings (Gagnon, The Bible And Homosexual Practice) when you say:>>>>""we partitioned, outside of the context of the scripture... same-sex unions into acceptable ones... and unacceptable ones... This partitioning did not exist at all in scripture""<<<< I submit that scripture does differentiate (partition) same sex sexual activity and that this differentiation/partition was recognized by the authors of scripture who wrote about Sodom, by the authors of scripture who alluded to Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 and by Jewish rabbis and philosophers like Philo of Alexandria. All of them focused on shrine prostitution when discoursing on these verses, as did the rabbis whose human wisdom fills the Babylonian Talmud.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Babylonian-Talmud-On-Sodom.html  Further, Dr. Gagnon (THE most ardent anti-gay evangelical alive today) contradicts your assertion on pages 100-110 and 130 of his book when he asserts the primacy of shrine prostitution in ancient Israel and remarks that shrine prostitution was the primary manifestation of homosexual activity in ancient Israel.Gagnon, the anti-gay crusader, differentiates committed faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships from the shrine prostitution against which Moses and God inveigh in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13.Second, EVERY human author of scripture who mentions Sodom fails to link Sodom to homosexuality.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Sin-of-Sodom.html  Third, EVERY human author of scripture who alludes to Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 links the verses to shrine prostitution or the qadesha (shrine prostitutes).  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Shrine-Prostitutes.html  In attempting to buttress your argument I believe you vastly overreach when you state:>>>>""I submit, because at *least at that time*, the writers of scripture quite probably saw any same-sex sexual union *only in that context*, and couldn't conceive of it outside of an idolatrous, cultic context.""<<<<Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Repentance.html  "

The fact is, Jewish rabbis before, during and after the time of Christ, did discuss lesbianism and determined that lesbians are not included in the Levitical prohibitions.Your next assertion is more opinion, masquerading as fact.>>>>""Hence, Paul argues in this very passage that idolatry, in his mind, *leads* to this kind of ""vile affection"".""<<<<That is your opinion of Paul's argument. In point of fact, Paul's argument is focused on the consequences of idolatry, not an alleged condemnation of gay men and lesbians in Romans 1:26-27.Paul's argument posits idolatrous same sex activity - worship of the fertility goddess - as the result of idolatry.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1.html  To read Paul's words as a condemnation of faithful committed non-cultic same sex partnerships is an egregious mis-reading of the scriptures. It assumes ""facts"" not in evidence and reads into scripture what scripture manifestly does not say.Aristides, preaching and writing within 70 years of 58 A.D., (when Paul wrote Romans), understood Paul's words to refer to shrine prostitution.Justin Martyr, writing within 100 years of Paul, understood Paul to be speaking of shrine prostitution.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-And-Shrine-Prostitution.html  You seem to be asserting that: >>>>""Paul (not God, mind you, but Paul)""<<<< is the ultimate writer of Romans, a popular but unsubstantiated opinion in our post-Christian age.I disagree with what I understand you to be saying, since I strongly believe in the God-breathed purity, verbal inspiration, absolute authority, infallibility and inerrancy of scripture.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Scripture.html  >>>>""I really think the reason why your argument is not convincing to many is because it overreaches and flies in the face of a simple reading of the text""<<<<A text without a context is a pretext for teaching something that is not true.The overreaching is almost entirely on the side of those who refuse to factor in the context God and Moses addressed in Genesis 19, Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 and Romans 1:26-27.

2,"I hear constantly about the ""outdated"" and ""no longer applicable"" verses in Leviticus - I recently read about a youngish - 40 something man- who had lived-according to modern standads- a relatively ""righteous"" life; but now he has throat cancer - why? it turns out that if you engage in oral sex the chances of acquiring the pap virus that causes cervical cancer in women- will increase your chances of oral and throat cancer, and it increases when you have multiple partners. The manifestation of throat cancer in younger patients who have never smoked or ""engaged in risky behavior"" is rising at an alarming rate. Why? because we have changed and accepted as ""normal"" what the Bible has prohibited or declared a sin. A man was designed to enter a woman, and a woman was designed to receive a man.Jesus dealt with remarriage, divorce, and He clearly stated what constitutes marriage - a man and a woman. And only one man for one woman, and only one woman for one man. We have a wondrous beautiful God of order and elegant, beautiful design. That His creation has been warped and deformed by sin is a fact.

1,"I truly don't understand why the concept of ""sin"" is raised at all. Clearly homosexuals are identical to heterosexuals in everything except sexual preference. Condemning someone for that seems entirely unchristian to me. The bible itself has been re-written, translated, intentionally altered dozens of times over the 1800 or so years. There were originally many more books, but only four were chosen, for most likely political reasons.There are passages in the bible that claim it is okay to allow fathers to KILL their children for disobeying. Citing chapters in the bible to prove a point is ignorant, pointless, stupid, and socially damaging, when many passages contain truly disgusting acts made by christians."
2,"Why is it silly?  I would like to know more about this!! How much do you actually know about the History of the Bible?  I can tell you, though I am not a student of the Bible, that there are 66 books in the Bible.  More than that if you include the Apocrypha from the 1611 version of the Bible.  It is no more silly for people to follow the principles of the Bible than it is for you or I to follow the teachings of any modern day writer.  What does that mean?  It means that you pick any given writer of today (not fictional).  They have a following.  That following is known for their stance on the teachings of that individual.  From what I do know of the Bible, there are allot of Customs dealt with in the Bible that were specific to the Jews.  Those were Old Testament laws.  A person using the Bible to prove their point is no more ignorant, pointless, stupid, and socially damaging than someone picking up the latest Psychology book by the Latest writer and Whole heartedly following what that person teaches."

Let me boil this down to one question: Would it be wrong for an adult male to sexually abuse a female infant?  The child will have no recollection of the event(s), so no ""harm"" was technically done, and it fulfilled the deranged desires of the abuser.  What would you do if this happened to YOUR daughter?This absurd example is an extreme, used to highlight the fallacy and illogical nature of modern ""logic.""God's reality and commands never lead to anything ""disgusting.""  The Old Testament commands about 'putting to death' is hyperbole.  For example, to my knowledge, there are no records showing that disrespectful children were put to death.  I believe social commands such as this one were given to highlight the importance of and to decree the exact social hierarchy/structure (e.g. the role and respect given to parents; their influence and control over their children)."

1,"George Rawlinson, 1812-1902, in History of Phoenicia, written in 1889, describes Molech as a god worshiped by the Canaanites and Phoenicians. Here is Rawlinson's description of shrine prostitutes.    “At the head of the Pantheon stood a god and a goddess, Baal (Molech) and Ashtoreth... As Baal was the embodiment of the generative principle in nature, so was Ashtoreth of the receptive and productive principle. She was the great nature goddess, the Magna Mater, regent of the stars, queen of heaven, giver of life, and source of woman's fecundity...    [Canaanite religion was notable for] the prevalence of licentious orgies [involving shrine prostitutes] and of human sacrifice... Early rabbis describe the image of Moloch as a human figure with a bull's head and outstretched arms; and the account which they give is confirmed by what Diodorus relates of the Carthaginian Kronos...    “‘In the worship of Astarte [Ashtoreth, the ancient Canaanite fertility goddess]    prostitution of women, and of effeminate men [shrine prostitutes], played the same part that child murder did in the worship of Baal...        [Pagan worshipers believed] no service more acceptable could be rendered a deity than that of unchastity... Thus lust itself became a service of the gods...’        One fruit of this system was the extraordinary institution of the Galli. [Rawlinson equates the Galli [shrine prostitutes] with the KJV’s ‘sodomites’ - the ‘qedesha’ of the Hebrew text.]        The Galli were men, who made themselves as much like women as they could, and offered themselves for purposes of unnatural lust [unnatural in the sense of not procreative] to either sex [shrine prostitutes]. Their existence may be traced in Israel and Judah, [I Kings 14:24, 15:12] as well as in Syria and Phœnicia.        At great festivals, under the influence of strong excitement, amid the din of flutes and drums and wild songs, a number of the male devotees would snatch up swords or knives, which lay ready for the purpose, throw off their garments, and coming forward with a loud shout, proceed to castrate themselves openly...        They joined with the priests and the sacred women at festival times in frenzied dances and other wild orgies, shouting, and cutting themselves [much like the prophets of Baal in I Kings 18:19, 28] on the arms, and submitting to be flogged one by another...”        (from George Rawlinson, History of Phoenicia, 1889, Chapter XI.)    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Shrine-Prostitutes.html    "

That changes the context.I understand and knew about those practices, that they were destructive and the reason that the Canaanites were being purged (vomited) out of their land as well as the reason Egypt has never returned to the prominence it once had as the strongest nation; however, God specifically tells us to obey Him over the world, and what is the world telling us is okay now a days?

He calls men with men ""shameful"" and women leaving the natural use of the man.

1,"Before we can determine what scripture means for us today, we must understand what it meant for the people to whom it was originally given back then. In plainer words, what scripture means today is limited by what it meant back then.Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN.Whatever meaning we assign to Paul's words has to have been a probable understanding in the first century.There are three areas which help us understand what Paul meant back then.1. The historical context. First century Rome was an idolatrous culture with hundreds of temples to pagan gods and goddesses. One fertility goddess in particular was Cybele, known as the Protectress of Rome.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1.html    2. The religious context. The most prominent goddess figure in first century Rome was Cybele, the Phrygian fertility goddess. Five worship sites honored her in Rome at the time Paul wrote Romans.Roman coins bearing Cybele's likeness were inscribed with the words, Mater Deum, Mother of the gods.Cybele was worshiped by castrated Galli priests who offered themselves sexually to male worshipers.This is what Paul describes in Romans 1, citing the Old Testament experience of Jews who had rebelled against God and practiced fertility goddess worship.3. The way Christians back then understood Paul's words in Romans 1.Aristides, preaching before the Roman Emperor Hadrian, AD 126, linked Paul's words in Romans 1 to shrine prostitution.Justin Martyr, preaching around AD 150, linked Paul's words in Romans 1 to shrine prostitution.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-And-Shrine-Prostitution.html    To read Romans 1 today and say scripture is condemning a committed, faithful, non-cultic lesbian or gay partnership is to give the text a new meaning which was unknown to the original readers.And if it was unknown to the original readers, then that interpretation cannot be true because:Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN."
2,"First off, let me say thank you for your thoughtful comments.  I can see that you have really looked into this issue.  I have read the article on Romans and Shine Prostitution and found it to be well-argued.  Although, I am a little bothered by the use of the term anti-gay.  I have read portions of Gagnon's book and he, like yourself, struggled with this issue.  Early on in the book, he writes about his heartfelt struggle.  When someone argues that homosexual practice is a sin, this does not make them anti-homosexual, or anti-anything.  I have desperately struggled with this issue personally and for the sake of others.  I would never characterize myself as anti-gay.  As I grow closer to Jesus, I feel more and more his love for all people well up inside of me.  I wish the church as a whole weren't homophobic.  I wish I didn't have to hear people around me, most of whom are Christians, use ""gay"" and other words I won't mention, as derogatory comments.  (When I am feeling bold, I gently correct them.)  Sometimes I don't want to call myself a Christian because this associates me with some of the people who have incited hate-mongering against homosexuals.  My heart aches over this struggle because I have personally been affected by it and I have met many others who have felt these affects as well.In the sending of his only son, Jesus Christ, God offered all people a saving relationship with himself.  This is the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant:  ""I will bless you and make you a great nation and through you all people will be blessed"".  In this fulfillment, the people of God became all those who accepted, believed in, and followed the one whom God sent, Jesus Christ.  In the Mosaic or Sinai covenant, Israel was required to obey the Mosaic law in order to receive salvation.  But in Christ, the people of God, all people, Jew and Gentile, were freed from the law and now received salvation through the grace of Jesus Christ by faith.  So, to put it briefly, in Christ, God has removed the contractual obligation of the law and has offered a relationship.  This never ceases to amaze me!!  He wants to be in relationship with me!!  "

2,"But what do we do in relationship?  How do we treat our loved ones?  People mess up in biblical interpretation when they either try to remove New Testament requirements of obedience or they once again put back on the ""yoke of slavery"" (the law) that they have been freed from.  The fact is that true relationship demands love.  Loving someone is wanting what's best for the person you love.  What father or mother in their right minds, would want their child to do anything that would harm them?   I often here people quote out of context Matthew 7 about not judging others.  People respond indignantly when anyone challenges their beliefs or their choice of lifestyles and simply say, ""didn't Jesus say not to judge.""  Well actually, in Matthew 7:5, Jesus tells us to judge our brothers and sisters in Christ.  What he is condemning is hypocrisy, not judging.  In other words, he is condemning being ""judgmental,"" not judging your brother or sister in Christ.  Read the passage.  It says, ""You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.""   In other words, if you have taken the time to examine yourself and to deal with your own sin, you can then, and only then, more on to judging a brother or sister in Christ for their sin issues.  But this must be done in love?  Speak the truth in love and so on and so forth . . .  "
2,"You said Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN.  This is a true statement.  However, Scripture can have a different application then it did back then.  You seem to be very concerned with the cultural context of cult prostitution in ancient Rome.  And you seem to define ""idolatry"" in a very narrow sense.  But Paul does not do this.  Go on to Romans 1:28 when he begins to describe all manner of idolatry (which is simply worshipping anything besides creator God--today this could include worship of another person, worship of self, worship of money, worship of television, etc.):  ""And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice.  They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness.  They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them"" (ESV).So, is Paul still only talking about cult prostitutes here?  He seems to be talking about everyone.  I am thinking about the times I have envied, or gossiped, or was disobedient to my parents.  The question I am asking is:  why would Paul have switched so rapidly from talking about a specific group of people to talking about everyone?First and foremost, we must understand what Paul was trying to say with his words.  What was the author intended meaning.  This is primary.  It is strongly related to how the original audience would have understood Paul's letter, but they are not the same thing.  You seem to have given precedence to the cultural context of the passage over and above the context of the passage in the letter itself.  Both are equally important.  I would argue that placing a passage within the context of its surrounding passages, within the context of the letter itself, and within the context of the Bible as a whole is first and foremost in biblical interpretation.  Cultural context is our aide along the way, but if our findings do not fit the context of the surrounding passages, then we need to go back to the drawing board and reassess what Paul was trying to say.What do you think?"
2,"""But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.'[a] 7'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,[b] 8and the two will become one flesh.'[c] So they are no longer two, but one. 9Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.""Scripture as we know it - is only scripture because the whole book (all 66 chapters) flow together in a common theme. Therefore, topics that talk about man and woman and man and woman being the exclusive partnership that God blesses (marriage) are crucial. I'm sorry to see that you've not mentioned it(Mark 10:6-9) in your Seven Flawed Arguments. It may be that you cannot explain the matter, or that it doesn't flow with your interpretation of what you feel Scripture is saying.Scripture is clear here, what God has joined let no man separate. Now you may rightfully say that the context in which Jesus elaborates is a context of a discussion of adultery. (see Mark 10:2-4)""2Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, ""Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?""    3""What did Moses command you?"" he replied.      4They said, ""Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."" However, it is within the context of speaking of adultery that we understand what God has put together. God has put together man and woman, this is the pure blessing of God. I quote ""God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. This argument says God will only bless marriages exactly like Adam and Eve, although God never makes that assertion in the Bible. For example, only two chapters after Adam and Eve, we discover a polygamous marriage in Genesis 4:19, on man with two women.""However this assertion is not correct. He makes that assertion in Mark 10:6-9. Also, just because a listing is in the Bible does not authenticate itself because it is listed, nor because it appears to be blessed. What do I mean?God created man and woman to be the perfect union, and when we read about the union with the man and two women, it does not say that God blessed that union. We do know that this happened after sin entered into the world and was not the joining that God entitled for humans (see Mark 10:7). Therefore, just because you have a listed (correctly as it's mentioned in the Bible) a union between man and two women, doesn't mean it's authenticated by the Bible.Your statement about (4) Matthew 19:3-12 is also quite incorrect. Why so?First, Jesus doesn't make an exception for heterosexual marriage. Jesus only replies to his disciples assertion in verse 10 that it is better not to marry. Jesus doesn't say it is better not to marry a woman but instead a man. Actually, there are no contradictions to marriage between a man and a woman, only Jesus' response to his disciples. His response details why it's better not to marry.Second, you are right about three classes of eunuchs, but understand this - that a eunuch is one who has sexual organs removed (castration). And note the three classes, one born without sexual organs v.12, and one made that way by men (or humans) and finally one who has renounced marriage or become a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven(for ministry or the work of the clergy). There is no mention about exceptions for the case of homosexuality here, it appears to be your own interpretation. "
2,"The exception to being joined in a union that is blessed by God (as referred to in Mark 10:5-9 or Matthew 19:4-6) is not an exception about the type of union but about remaining single. There are three classes of people who it is better for them not to marry (enter a union blessed by God). It simply means being single. There is no inclusion for those who are not inclined as you define - toward heterosexual marriage. ""11Jesus replied, ""Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. 12For some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage[c]because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it."" Your point(7) about Jude 7 has been answered in another post by another post-er, strange flesh is a statement about relationships with angelic beings. So I won't elaborate about it.Your arguments seem well thought out and I appreciate the depth to which you've gone to illustrate them. However, you've missed using Scripture as a whole, in it's appropriate context.God is very clear about marriage, and I've made the due change in my life. I've listened to a lot of what society as a whole today deems as truth, but it doesn't mean that society is correct. However, God is a good God, he has given anyone the opportunity to decide for himself/herself.If I can choose no longer to be a homosexual, ask God for forgiveness of sin and am now entered in a marriage relationship - anyone can with God's guidance.I've only tackled some of your arguments, since I've noted that other post-ers have rebutted your other arguments.God bless."
2,"All the Scriptures below remind us that we have a sinful nature, and because of this sinful nature we have inclinations of different kinds. (This is why Dr. Dobson mentioned that in some cases people do not choose to feel same sex attraction) To have an inclination does not mean that we cannot use our God given free will/choice to choose what is right; our ability to reason is not in vain, it is because God, our Creator, did not want us to be like robots; He tells us through the Scriptures what is pure, noble and right, but it is up to us what we choose, or how we want to interpret His word to fit our sinful natures and try to silence our consciences. No matter how many want to justify sin, in the end, sin is sin, and each one will receive what is due according to his/her deeds.  *Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. Romans 8:5*Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. Romans 8:8*Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation—but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it.  Romans 8:12*For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. Romans 8:13*Therefore, God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.  They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.  Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lust. EVEN THEIR WOMEN EXCHANGED NATURAL RELATIONS FOR UNNATURAL ONES. IN THE SAME WAY MEN ALSO ABANDONED NATURAL RELATIONS WITH WOMEN AND WERE INFLAMED WITH LUST FOR ONE ANOTHER. MEN COMMITTED   INDECENT ACTS WITH OTHER MEN, AND RECEIVED IN THEMSELVES THE DUE PENALTY FOR THEIR PERVERSION.  ROMANS 1:24-27 *“If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” John 8:31-32 *But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8  "
2,"Rick,Thank you for your comments, which are quite well thought out. I have to say that even though they are well thought out, I disagree with them. I've found that your arguments ignore a common theme in scripture. I've also noted that you've not mentioned key passages about sexual relationships and marriage in their appropriate context. But before doing so, let me be specific about my views.Before I say anything else, I'd like to say that I am a former homosexual. I believe that the Bible dictates sin as sin, but does not condemn the person. What do I mean? John 3:16 writes that God loved the world (humans) and sent his son to die. God doesn't say that sin is acceptable, but provides the solution for it. God loves every person, and wants the best for them. In the same way whether a person is gay or not should not have a bearing on how God loves them, this according to scripture. However, at the same time, Scripture is crystal clear that homosexuality is a sin, and all sin needs to be dealt with, just as I have dealt with mine(1 John 1:8-10).In your Seven Flawed Arguments you have not mentioned Jesus sayings in their correct form: (Mark 10:6-9 NIV)"

Here Jesus establishes the obligation for a man to marry and be faithful to one wife. 9: And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.      This reaffirms the requirement of monogamy. 10: His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.     The disciples find this rule difficult to accept. 11: But he said unto them, All (men) cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.     Jesus gives them an option. In this option he says that there are those that cannot accept this rule (to marry a woman and be monogamous). It is important to note here that he does not say “will not”, “would rather not”, “chose not to”, but he said “cannot”. This would imply that he was referring to people incapable (mentally, physically, or both) from living by the rules of men. 12A (first category): For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb:     I suspect this means all those incapable of consummating a relationship with a woman for whatever reason. (hermaphrodite or gay). 12B (second category):  and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men:     We pretty well all agree that these are actual eunuchs.   12C (third category):  and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.      The church insists that these are simply celibate priests.    Logically neither of the first two groups would have any interest in women, so they would by their very nature be celibate.    The problem is that there is nothing said or done up to the moment that Christ said this that would indicate that celibacy was a requirement or even a virtue in priests. In fact, all indications are that it was disallowed. How do you “make yourself a Eunuch”?  To be a eunuch 2000 years ago meant more than simple celibacy.    What Jesus said in Mathew 19 is completely self contained and can only be read literally. Well once again lets look at verse: 5: And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?     No doubt about it, if you were capable of consummating a relationship with a woman, you were required to be married. More importantly, if you were a man you were required to be married. To declare yourself a eunuch was to declare yourself uninterested in women, a eunuch, a non man. This was understood readily 2000 years ago, but modern society has a hard time grasping it.    Having said this there were eunuchs that were allowed into the temple (natural eunuchs who were anatomically correct).     If Jesus was not married he was a eunuch by his own definition. He was anatomically correct because he regularly entered the temple. He had to be a natural eunuch (or married, one or the other).    Only by declaring themselves eunuchs were they exempt from the requirement of marriage. In fact, they were exempt from all rules pertaining only to “men”. The reason was that they were not considered to be “men”. Rules quoted about man being with man did not apply to eunuchs because eunuchs were not considered to be men. The sin was not being gay, but pretending to be men while engaging in gay behavior.     It is most likely that the natural eunuch was the first category: 12A: For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb:and likely included homosexuals.   This group: 12C:  and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.      If Jesus was not married, then he was a eunuch. If his genitalia was mutilated he could not enter the temple. If the church’s definition of “born that way"" was hermaphrodites, then Jesus could not be either “born that way” or “made that way”. This only leaves “made themselves eunuchs” as an option for Jesus. “Made themselves eunuchs” can only mean one of two things---actually had themselves castrated, or had no interest in women. Either way, in Jesus time, it was a renunciation of manhood at the least.    In that the church has painted him as celibate, they have painted themselves into a corner.     It all ends with: 12D: He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.     Translate---He that can be married should do so, and he who is a eunuch should accept that. You are what you are."
2,"""Your statements are mutually exclusive. You cannot logically claim that our modern concept of heterosexual is a recent development and then argue that this ""recent development"" is exclusively defined in the Bible (2000 to 3400 years ago) as ""between a man and a woman"" (heterosexuality).""These statements are not mutually exclusive.  You have changed contexts and set up a 'straw man' to knock down.  In western culture, the concept of hetero and   homosexuality   is quite a recent development.  However, the context of this claim is that the -->concept Furthermore, the use of the 'definition of heterosexuality', as used by the exodus poster, was used to show that heterosexuality is defined in the   bible   and that all other   sex   acts are forbidden.

2,"It is unclear to me your intentions for citing the love between Jonathan and David.  I've read these interactions many times in many translations and I've yet to see anything that displays a committed homosexual relationship.  I can see how it is easily misunderstood.  Differentiating between philia and eros is critical.  I see philia quite readily throughout the   bible   betwee two men or two   women  , I have yet to see eros between two men celebrated in the bible.  "

2,"""For all I'm concerned people can marry their cat if they want to. If it doesn't hurt anyone, what does it matter?""1) It would certainly hurt the cat if the person who married it tried to consummate the marriage. Aside from the physical harm it would suffer, I highly doubt that the poor feline would consent to being violated in such a manner.2) I'm pretty sure bestiality is outlawed everywhere. It's one of many so-called ""alternative lifestyles"" that federal and state governments neither protect nor should protect."
1,"Now, I'm all for animal rights, but let's be reasonable. Cats don't have the same rights as humans! I was exaggerating by the way, and I figured someone with half a brain would have been smart enough to recognize that, but apparently since you don't have even half a brain you weren't smart enough to recognize that. My question still remains...who does the homosexual lifestyle hurt? The answer is absolutely nobody. Or perhaps you are still living in the past where AIDS was called the ""gay disease"" (which it has been proven that it's transmitted just as fast in unprotected heterosexual intercourse)?  Not everybody is a Christian. Stop trying to enforce Christian values on non-Christians. That's the ONLY (and very poor) excuse to deny 10% of the population their civil rights. "
2,"No, not at all! Look up the definition of ""pervert"" (the verb, not the noun) or ""perversion""  Then go do some sociological and psychological research (that you(plural) obviously have not done) on the developmental and childhood causes of most homosexuals, and then take of your ""myopic rose colored glasses."" I do not stand against homosexuals being as they are, anymore than it is that no one is perfect or without blemish. I have had homosexual roomates and dear friends. I do not at all have a problem with them living their lifestyle as they choose. -as so may of you put it, ""they are not hurting anyone"" But when we start to ourselves, as a society, pervert the truth about the issue(pervert the truth about perversion), and THEN TAKE IT AN UNACCEPTABLE STEP FARTHER, by saying it is ok, and promoting or advocating it through the legalizing of the sanctity of marriage, is a totally different issue from with which should be protected from. Society should not be able to legislate the advocation of homosexuality to children or anyone else. That is the issue. Homosexual's were given protection from discrimination and same rights as married couples (which is discrimination, by the way) yet, it is never enough and are not satisfied. It is a lie to say it is about rights and equality. It is about cramming the advocation and acceptance of that lifestyle down the throats of society. Please, practice what you aree preaching, ""leave society in peace!""  -But you will not do it; because you refuse to see anything other than how it suits your own desires or your own agenda. I once realized, and accepted the idea that I can not always have things the way i want them; or always force or have people give in to my preferences and my perspectives. Why can you(plural) not do the same?More importantly, that same argument, then exist for almost any other group, or person, with an unusual, or seemingly distasteful, illegal or perverted preference or lifestyle. Stop lying! "
1,"Your comment above states: ""Homosexual's were given protection from discrimination and same rights as married couples (which is discrimination, by the way)""First, how is this discrimination?  How is giving someone equal rights discrimination?  Who is being discriminated against?Second, if Homosexuals have been given protection from discrimination and the same rights as married couples, then why can't they be married?Have you really given much thought to your opinion?  Give me a legitimate argument for banning same sex marriage.  I think we both agree that marriage is a good thing.  It helps to stabilize society and is an enriching experience for the couple and their family.  So, if we agree that marriage is good, how can marriage also be bad?  How can including more people in a good thing be bad?I know, it is morally wrong to allow same sex couples to marry... Right?  Well, as I said before, that was the same argument used against inter-racial marriage just a few years ago. It's an empty argument and it won't hold up to the Constitution.  So you'd better come up with something else."
1,"I believe that was ruined long ago.    Furthermore, marriage sucks.  I'm not kidding.  Unless you think it acceptable and sanctimonious to sell you daughter?  Or unless you believe that women are merely property of men?  That's the original intent of marriage and for thousands of years, that's how it went.  Calling a hideous tradition a sanctimonious act is like calling slavery sanctimonious.    Simply because this has changed to marriage being an actual choice between two consenting adults who love each other doesn't change the history of the act, does it?  Nor  was the ""sanctity"" of marriage any less sanctimonious when it was illegal for inter-racial couples to tie the knot.And just how has the sanctity of marriage been preserved and protected from heterosexual couples? Britney Spears? Drew Barrymore? A 17 hour marriage? Drive-thru chapels?  Sanctimonious enough for you?What is UNACCEPTABLE is for one brainwashed group of people to say that homosexuality is not okay.  What is UNACCEPTABLE is for one brainwashed group of people to use democracy to discriminate against another group simply because it ""suits your own desires or your own agenda.""You do not have to like homosexuality anymore than I like the fact that some people will continue to  wear crosses around their necks and carry guns in their hands and march off into war because it's their duty for country.  As if the laws they say they live their by are superseded by their love country.  (Which, you don't have to say anything about that, I'm using it as an example of what I have to accept.)    What you cannot and should not do is to support laws that intentionally leave out a group of people simply because they are in the minority.  Unless, of course, you thought it was perfectly acceptable for laws to be made that discriminated against black people simply because black people were in the minority.Stop lying to yourself."
1,"I don't need to run through the 1,183 reasons why that's wrong.As the Supreme Court stated in Loving v. Virginia:""Because we reject the notion that the mere “equal application” of a statute containing racial classifications is enough to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription of all invidious racial discriminations, we do not accept the State's contention that these statutes should be upheld if there is any possible basis for concluding that they serve a rational purpose.  The mere fact of equal application does not mean that our analysis of these statutes should follow the approach we have taken in cases involving no racial discrimination where the Equal Protection Clause has been arrayed against a statute discriminating between the kinds of advertising which may be displayed on trucks in New York City, Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New York, 336 U.S. 106 (1949), or an exemption in Ohio's ad valorem tax for merchandise owned by a nonresident in a storage warehouse, Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U.S. 522 (1959)....  In the case at bar, however, we deal with statutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of equal application does not immunize the state from the very heavy burden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race.""In other words, miscegenation laws were not ""equal protection"" even though both races were punished equally for entering an interracial marriage.  Similarly, DOMAs are not ""equal protection"" even though both genders are punished equally for entering a same-sex marriage because there can be said to be an invidious gender-based discrimination.  The test, then, is whether there is a ""rational"" basis for same-sex couples not to get married, which I contend that there is not.Or perhaps people wanting to engage in same-sex marriages should just put up and shut up with how they are already treated?  Perhaps miscegenation laws were also Constitutional?"
2,"Is not the very basis for same sex marriage, ""EQUALITY?!"" So then, now that YOU mentioned it: Why should someone who wants to paractice beastiality be denied their ""right"" to do so? Why should they be ""discriminated against."" And so then, likewise, why should pedophiles also be deinied the same oppostunity to love and care for somone of their sexual preference and orientation?? -If it is concentual; or at least at certain age minimum, like say, 12 or 13. what if they were ""born that way?"" They are ""people too."" Pedophilia laws and beastiality laws are ""discriminatory"" and violate their rights to excercise their freedom. -Maybe almost ALL laws are then.  After all, ""who does it hurt?"" It does not harm anyone.  What about people that want to murder, and people that want to die? Let us hook them up and legalize that.Supposedly, according to that same SSM agenda agument basis, who is another person to determine what is and is not acceptable?... or what is and is not right? Just because you disagree; or you think it gross or unacceptable; what gives us the right to try and ""force that on another, and deniy them ""inalienable rights?"" For that matter, who or what determines what rights are ""inalianable?"" So then we have to allow ALL rights then. What if I want to urinate in the neighborhood park, at night where not exposing to anyone? Why should I be denied that right? Who does it harm? Public urination laws are ""discriminatory."" Are you starting to understand the definition of ""pandora's box"" yet? Where do we draw the line? -Or do you realize you are indirectly advocating the drawing of NO LINES, and the erasing of many? Hey, ""EQUAL"" means ""EQUAL!"" and ""right to"" means ""right to"" and escecially, ""DISCRIMINATION"" means ""DISCRIMINATION!""  -Or are you trying to have your cake and eat it too?  Yes, you certainly are. The fact that one may not have intended to, nor realized they were, does not exonerate one form the guiltiness of such, nor preclude one from the responsibility.(""You"" and other pronoun references are general and not aimed at author in reply, but only ""as the shoes fits"" for rhetorical purposes)BTW: this excerp pretty much addresses almost all of the comments in support of SSM, in one way or another; as it completely obliterates the primary basis of the SSM argument."
1,"Are you suggesting that we should freeze things the way they are now?  No more rights for anyone?  We've finally got it right, and if we go any farther we'll open 'Pandora's Box'?  Are you sure we haven't gone just a little too far?  Maybe we should take away a women's right to vote...  Or maybe we should take away the right for persons of different races to marry... Or maybe we should segregate the schools again...  We should have a negro league for all sports...  We should outlaw liquor again...  We shouldn't allow women to work...  We should decide on just one religion and throw all the non-christians out of our perfect country.God only knows the dangers of allowing two consenting adults to pledge themselves to one another.  It would be just like a man raping a child.  Or maybe it would be more like a man raping a cat.  And also, 12 and 13 year olds would be considered adults if we allow same sex couples to marry.Now, quite frankly, I think your opinion and your logic is gross and unacceptable.  But that's your business.  And I can choose to think you're wrong without wanting to force you to think just like me.  And you can think same sex marriage is wrong.  But how will it affect you on a daily basis if same sex couples marry?"
2,"Ok, good point about ""In the end...don't like same-sex marriage? Then shut up and don't get one. That easy.""  So I do not like pedophilia, so I will just shut up and not fool around with boys and girls.  You are right, that was ""easy.""  -Good thing I dont have children to protect, huh?"
1,"Since when has pedophilia been consensual? Answer: NEVER. The cut here has to do with consent. A young person does not have the mental capacity to consent to anything. Same-sex marriage hurts nobody because it's done by two consenting adults.. BTW, I also support euthanasia, as you mentioned previously, for whatever reason...depression, terminal illness, just tired of life, etc. Again, we boil down to the religious argument. It ALL has to do with religion, and since religion is BS anyway, oh well. "

It's part of some people's   religion   (as stupid as organized religion really is and the fact that God is a non-existent figment of people's imaginations). Now 17 might be pushing it a bit. The age of majority may still need to be enforced, but you know, that's about it. Of course you have to be 18 (or have parental consent) to enter into other contracts as well.

1,"Restoring the liberty of homosexual individuals to marry whomever they choose has nothing at all to do with agreeing with their preferences in sexual partners or their lifestyle. Agreement with them is not required. What is required in any civilized culture which claims to value individual rights and liberties is respect for their individual humanity and their personal pursuit of happiness. Assuming an individual is not infringing the liberty of another to exercise their individual rights, that individual is owed to them the liberty to do the same.I must remind those who object to granting liberty to same-sex couples to marry one another that, regardless of how right you believe your viewpoint and values, there are always thousands of individuals in the United States who disagree with your points of view, your beliefs, your values, your chosen lifestyle. Perhaps some of those who disagree with and object to you would see that you lose some liberties to enforce their point of view upon your choices. If you would not have the practice of suppressing liberties because the lifestyle of another makes you uncomfortable become a standard approach to relationships in cultures, perhaps you ought not encourage such thinking by thinking in such ways yourself. You will, no doubt, be forging the chains you will someday wear.If you wish to live with optimum liberty, although you do not owe another your agreement, you DO owe any and all your respect of their liberties. If you do not believe this true, then you explicitly disagree with a culture that holds as its highest value individual rights and liberties. What you truly value is an elitist culture - liberty for some, slavery for others. Perhaps your viewpoint is better suited for a feudal society or one similar to Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea or perhaps Cuba.Those dictatorships are always looking for your sort of affirming opinions."

Now you have contributed to bankrupting your state.Additionally in response: So then that author, and other's making the same argument about wanting ""ALL people having equal rights"" then also supports consentual pedophilia. It does not hurt anyone either. -Or is it that ultimately, we actually,(truthfully, behind the smoke and mirrors) only really support the rights of those things that we think are acceptable or are not opposed to?  -Hmmmm...It does not take an intelligent philosopher to understand that ""equal rights"" are a ""delusional illusion"" How can everyone have equal rights for all of the things they want? -Proposterous! and a lie of society.  And until we admit this and get over our SELF-CENTERED agendas that seek only to have things as it pleases us; and give up on pursuing some of our rights; realizing ""you can't always get what you want!"" we will only keep going the wrong direction and losing ground; all the while thinking we are accomplishing the opposite. -Spells DISASTER and CHAOS."

Try looking at this issue from a purely logical point of view.  I'm not gay, so I don't have any reason to feel strongly about this, except that the logic is clear.  There is no good argument against same sex marriage.  All arguments against are purely emotional.  Take a few minutes and really ponder this."
2,"I'll help you out with my non-religious opinion. Since the earths creation, even before religion, it has been a man and woman. Same sex couples can not obtain the progression of life ""naturally"". Thus, indoctrinating society to accept something that is by natural law ""unnatural"". Now, why should we indoctrinate society to accept conduct when it doesn't enhance natural progression? Marriage is NOT a fundamental right. The only difference from their equal civil unions is the label of marriage, which is much more than a commitment between two people. It is the formation of a family which includes procreation and the rearing of children. The voters of California have already spoken once to preserve the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman. It should remain so. We need to evaluate what standards our society want to live by and not a failing judicial system. Civil liberties are NOT civil rights YES on 8 "
1,"Marriage is indeed considered a Fundamental Right under the Constitution of the U.S.  Please do your research on this.  It seems that the Yes side is very, very lazy.  Lookup Loving v. Virginia.  It wasn't very long ago that mixed-race marriage was illegal.  This is what a judge in Virginia had to say about mixed-race marriage just 50 years ago... ""Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, Malay and red, and He placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with His arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that He separated the races shows that He did not intend for the races to mix.""    This sounds so much like the Yes on 8 agrument.  It should make you all sick to your stomach."

I do not know... but the ""NO"" side is definitely and unarguably (as already evidenced) very myopic and self centered, and unintelligent in basis and rhetorical construct, or the lacking thereof. It is unarguable that their positions ABSOLUTELY only uses the basis for their claim for SSM narrow mindedly and one sided, without considering the other and EQUAL side of those same arguments about ""equality"" and ""discrimination.""  Basically, its the whole use only the parts or position of an argument or example as it suits your agenda; but not as it does not.

1,"Explain to me who will suffer if same sex couples are allowed to marry?  Also, explain how someone will suffer?  I want concrete examples, not fear mongering.  Try to be clear with your comment."
2," Marriage should be defined as between a man and a woman. Marriage has always been viewed by society as the religious and/or civil union between a man and a woman, and has always been regarded primarily as a heterosexual institution. This has involved thousands of years of tradition. The length of this tradition has made it unnecessary to produce a clear definition defining it. But, now that this lengthy tradition of marriage is under threat, its full historical force should be leveled in now defining it as between a man and a woman. If homosexual couples want equal protection under the law, that is one thing, but to call it ""marriage"" is to violate the rooted tradition and meaning of marriage.

2,"Then why cant a 42 year old man marry a consenting 13 year old??!! Especially, ""they aren't hurting anyone!""  SSM advocates have made the treacherous and unintelligent comparative analogy to racial discrimination; and it will be one of the many of your own arguments, by which their agenda will be exposed. Apples to Oranges! An attorney representing pedophiles, and many other such groups, will have a MUCH MORE ACCURATELY CLOSER comparative analogy to legalizing SSM and homosexuality, than SSM advocates have to ""racial"" discrimination. Ok, so then using your argument, a cultural or tribal or religious sect should also be allowed to practice human sacrifice; as was percieved as appropriate and acceptable in many cultures.  Who are any of us to say that perspective is wrong and should not be tolerated? See, you (plural) are doing it again."
1,I'm equating inter-racial marriage to same sex marriage on the basis of discrimination.  A logical and easily understood argument.You are comparing same sex marriage to pedophiles and human sacrifice.  That's just weird.
1,"You really need to do some reasearch on the Due Process Clause and the 14th Ammendment to the U.S. Constitution and recent decisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Because, honestly, you don't know what you are talking about."
1,"First: the right to choose one's own partner is a fundamental right. You'd never give up your right to choose your partner, why should anyone else?Second: Same-sex relationships are 100% legal as long as there is consent. A minor is not an adult and therefor cannot give consent. Equating grown men and women to children is just insulting.Third: Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black. Please explain how exactly two grown men or women cannot give consent legally like a 13 year old? Also, please explain how refusing the right to marry based on physical gender is any different than refusing the right to marry based on skin color."
1,"Because one cannot exist nor act ""outside of nature"", i.e., there being no ""outside"", all that one does is necessarily natural. Your argument is one of assumption that the purpose of a single human life and the purpose of ALL human life is procreation. Although true, the species will not continue without a sufficient number of individuals reproducing, you assume also that it is the duty of either every or at least some individuals to do so. I would submit there is no such duty to ""carry on the species"", however, one is certainly and ought certainly be free to do so if one wishes. What one is not free to do nor ought to be free to do is compel a false duty to reproduce on every individual member of the abstract idea of ""species"".I must also submit that the word and utterance ""marriage"" has many meanings depending on the one using it and context of its use. Individual human beings ""marry"" themselves to one another in an enormously diverse number of ways. Mere ""best friends"" are married to one another. Employer and employee are ""married"" from a certain form of view. One is ""married"" to one's pets if there is a mutual love, mutual dependence. Same-sex and, indeed differently sexed couples and even large groups of individuals have been marrying themselves to one another since before the dawn of this species we call ""humanity"". There is nothing anyone can do to prevent the emotional marriage of two or more individuals to one another if they so choose. They and their detractors often do not understand or, in the least, forget the fullest implications of the concept of ""marriage"". Certainly, those who rail against same-sex marriage as a potential redefinition of ""marriage"" seem to miss the irony of their very limited understanding of the much broader concept. Communities may or may not be at liberty to suppress official recognition of a ""marriage"" of two or more people. As a more advanced thinker, I am little bothered by what communities allow or disallow on this issue. An authentic marriage is one of the heart, mind, spirit.No government, vote, voter, law or court can allow or disallow what is quite outside of their control. That communities create a bit of paper and a stamp and then deny some few to participate in ownership of that unnecessary paper and stamp is a ludicrous self inflation of childish human beings. Those genuinely committed to one another have no need of community approval."

They will have an uphill battle because over half of the US states and many foreign countries have already voted to preserve that marriage ""is a man and woman."" You go California with your liberal ideologies. I am a bigot because:...1. Throughout history, marriage has only been between a man and woman...2. The natural law of humanity only allows an egg and sperm to procreate...3. Civil Liberties is not civil rights..4. Civil rights is not conduct...5.  We are being indoctrinated by society to accept conduct when it goes against personal ethics..6.

1,"If history teaches us anything, it teaches us that change for the good is always an uphill battle.  There was a time when slavery was considered necessary for the good of the country.  There was a time when women were not allowed to vote.  There was a time when keeping the races separated was thought to be an idea that God considered appropriate.  There was a time when Jewish persons were killed in gas chambers, just for being Jewish.  There was a time when Christians were killed for being Christians.  I hope that someday soon we'll be able to say... There was a time when we didn't allow same sex couples to marry.  Every single one of these changes were hard fought.  And every single time, there was someone on the other side, Roman, Nazi, KKK, who argued that the status quo was for the good of society."
1,"The statement ""throughout history, marriage has only been between a man and woman"" may be true if one limits oneself to a very narrow definition of ""marriage"" in order to ignore the overwhelming numbers of authentic marriages that existed and exist now outside of your limited definition. Human beings are quite talented in marrying themselves to places, to times, to objects, to individuals of other species and, of course, to one another in a seemingly infinite number of ways. All that's really required of a ""marriage"", at least for one involving at least one human being, is authenticity of commitment.It is quite demonstrable that there have been and are many legally-recognized or community-sanctioned ""marriages"" lacking authentic commitment from the very beginning and many non-sanctioned ""marriages"" with unwavering authentic commitment. All this to show, community sanction and legality have little really to do with authentic commitment and genuine marriage.The statement regarding ""throughout history"" is unsupportable. Throughout history ""marriage"" has been defined in a long and growing list of ways and can be expected to be widely and diversely defined in the future.Bigots can define words for themselves, however, they may not define them for others."

You can be just as vocal about being irrationally against something just like the KKK is.... you don't have to accept gay marriage.

Respect of opinions should be given to all and I believe the right to maintain individual opinions on this matter is important. However, the Supreme Court's Decision has taken away Californian's legal right to disagree with Same-Sex Marriage and is in fact forcing that opinion upon us. While I have not qualms with giving a license to Same-Sex Couples, the Supreme Court did more then that in their ruling. Please find and read it. They placed Same-Sex and Traditional Marriages as equals that cannot be separated, and that has brought up a slew of civil-right and religious issues, as well as taking away our right to have an opinion on the issue. If you wish to have an opinion on this issue, vote Yes on Proposition 8."
2,"Marriage is an institution of religion that should not be state regulated. The state has an institution of it's own called the ""Civil Union"". The state should recognize civil unions between same sex couples, since they should be afforded the same rights under government as any other partnership (i.e. marriage). The idea of marriage should be defined only in the context of religious beliefs, and the state should not have any power over what the church deems as appropriate or inappropriate.

1,"In this day and age, many gay couples choose to have children.  Using the rationale of the above argument, they should be able to marry.      The reality is that the ""Yes on 8"" crowd aren't concerned with the wellbeing of children, they are just anti-gay.   If they really were concerned with children they would be working to make divorce much harder.  Personally I think it would be good if divorced couples had to pay higher taxes for 10 years following a divorce.  It would also be good to have a law that says that if a baby is born out of wedlock, the father and mother automatically become married upon the birth of the baby.   If the issue really is having children raised by two parent families, they should be advocating those approaches, not trying to make some families feel they are second class.   It "
1,"Children are currently being responsibly reared by gay couples, where one of the partners is a biological parent. Allowing adoption by the other merely confers legal rights on an already successful, if informal, family model.

2,"Marriage between a man and woman is fundamental to family unit. It has been this way throughout history, regardless of religion, in ALL societies from primative to developed. It is natural law. It provides the structure for procreation and then nurturing, educating, and developing the children into productive members of society. Each child needs a father and a mother in their upbringing to model both. There is ample evidence that when either are missing, poverty and dysfunction increases (however noble the efforts of the single parent).

1,"It is purely alarmist to think and believe that granting the liberty of legal marriage to same-sex couples or any set of non-traditional individuals is the end of what has been traditional marriage. Opposite-sex couples will continue to meet, fall in love and perhaps marry as they always have and likely always will. Perhaps it is time they no longer are able to do so as an elite set of human beings with their liberty purchased at the expense of denying such liberty to others.The liberty of legal marriage reserved for man-woman couples is elitism. It has little to no respect for the higher value of individual rights and mutual liberty. There is no righeousness in in denying homosexuals the liberty to marry whomever or as many as they choose in the pursuit of personal happiness.As for redefining ""marriage"", perhaps we ought not limit ourselves to the very narrow special-interest definition of the major religions. After all, ""christian"" is only a subset of ""human""."
1,"This is not an argument against gay marriage, this is an argument for ""traditional"" families who are dropping the ball to step up.  If you really believe that children do best with married biological parents in a low-conflict marriage, why aren't you encouraging that?  Why not ban divorce, make fighting illegal, or forbid adoption?  All of those things are more of a threat to the ideal child-rearing environment you propose than gay marriage.  How exactly does two guys getting married stop you from providing your ideal environment to your children?  It shouldn't. On the other hand, I noticed that you argued that the purpose of marriage is to have children, and no other purpose should be allowed.  The vast array of legal benefits to marriage are completely irrelevant in your mind, right?  Fine, if the sole purpose of marriage is for the children, you will have no objection to immediately stripping all legal rights granted to spouses.  You said yourself, the purpose of marriage is not to grant rights.  It also seems that those who will not or cannot have children, like me, should not be allowed to marry even if they are heterosexual.  This is the logical end point of your argument, are you sure this is really what you're proposing?  I have a problem with that, and I'm sure I'm not alone."
1,"            I'm amazed the hatred of gays, other by so called Christains!!            You are going to have a problem with this because who is to say what someone is, man or woman?            Everyone is really both man and woman, just different %.  Very few supermales/superfemales are born, most a combo of the 2.             Where the problem comes is those whom are both sex appearing having various combo's of sex organs or none at all. Since they are both, does that mean they can't marry? There are many more of these than talked about.            But really sex is in the brain. If you see a nice female and want to kiss her, you are a male sex wise no matter what sexual organs you have.            So this law is illegal if passed as it restricts some to no marriage at all, violating their basic human rights. Let's stop the hate and let whomever wants to be a family be between consenting adults. A family is those who care for you, not whom is biological your parent if they don't care.. God will punish those whom hate, hurt.jerryd"
1,I live in a place I'd rather not acknowledge exists.  Many children here only have one parent to care for them.  It would be a GIFT for these children to have a second adult in their life guiding and supporting them.  Gay marriage is not going to tear apart the family structure (and if it does it wasn't a good structure to begin with).  I agree that marriage has its purpose to bring children into this world but there are plenty of heterosexual marriages that result in two people who have no desire to reproduce.  Is that a marriage in the eyes of organized religion?In closing I don't agree that the best family structure is two parents of opposite genders.  I believe the best family structure is two parents who care for their children.
1,"You're making the assumption that homosexuality is not natural - that only sex between man and woman is natural and therefore what binds them together.  Homosexuality is quite natural. It exists in nature between animals and also in humans. You're also making the assumption that marriage has typically been between one man and one woman.  As if the entire world has always shared this decidedly Christian view.  Furthermore, in most societies - including those ancestral societies you speak of in which the child was better off with the biological mother and father - the raising of the child has typically been a group effort. It's only been in our society, within the past 200 years that this has changed.  What benefits children is having as many people as possible in their lives who love and support them.  It makes little difference if these people are biologically related, or married.  Gay marriage isn't about raising children, it's the right that exists to bind yourself to a person for rest of your life if you so choose.  Placing another factor in the mix doesn't say anything about the original argument - that gay marriage is wrong.And further to that - marriage is a religious act.  Government should makes no laws establishing rules of any religious ceremony (barring sacrifices of humans or anything that infringes upon the rights of another)."

Over 50% of marriages end up in divorce and in some cases, it can get ugly.  How do you think that effects the children.

I wonder if that is still acceptable.6:  Gay folks who would like to devote their lives to one another is NO business of the church.  They are hurting no one but themselves. They want to have the right to build their lives with someone they love.  They want the right to put each other on their insurance.  They want to buy a house together, when one of them croaks they want the same rights that come with marriage.  I have NO problem with it.

1,The whole purpose of the Constitution is to put limits on what can be accomplished by the will of a majority at any given time.   Any democratic government will go through periods where a majority of its citizens get upset about something and there is a call to take action because of the mood of the moment.  We need the constitution to protect us from our worst instincts at such times.    To use the Constitution to enact permanent prejudice and take away people's rights because of prejudice against them is wrong.
2,"Regarding marriage, race is a superficial attribute whereas gender is not. A man and a woman from different racial backgrounds can unquestionably procreate children and provide father and mother models in nurturing, educating, and developing them.

For a judge to compare racial differences to sexual differences (or orientation) shows plain ignorance of biological and historical facts, as well as judicial incompetence.

We must use the Constitution and every constitution to enhance liberty rather than destroy it. Our children will either have to suffer our mistakes ... or correct our stupidity."
1,The church is not a wealthy Hollywood entity; it supports prop 8. It has supported marriage between one man and one woman for an astonishing long 112 YEARS! Before that church doctrine supported POLYGAMY. That the church should try to force its new philosophy on others is a puzzlement.

Supporters of gay-marriage may say all that this is about is 'two loving people getting married.'  But it's not that simple, and to think it is is very naive.  The possible repercussions of legalizing gay-marriage are innumerable and unknown.  We cannot risk to leave these unknown consequences to chance.When you throw a rock in a pond, the ripples extend very far.  Prop 8 is not focused as much on the initial impact of the rock hitting the pond as we are on the ripples that will result.Yes on 8.God bless."

However, so long as homosexuals are treated as lesser members of society there will continue to be murders and beatings of homosexuals by bigots who feel their acts are vindicated by such social treatment.  In that respect, no matter what the intention, the acts are those which support hatemongers.I made an error on my prior posting and clicked on ""yes"" rather than ""no because I didn't watch what I was doing.

2,"While individuals may chose to agree with or not agree with Same-Sex marriages, including religions, the California Supreme Court has ruled that Same-Sex Marriage and Traditional Marriage are the same (please read the California Supreme Court consolidated ""In Re Marriage Cases""), and as such, cannot be legally distinguished or separated. What now happens to individuals or religious institutions who continue to separate them, or to disagree with Same-Sex Marriage. Their right to hold an opinion is now legally weakened. In fact, Catholic Adoption Services in Massachusetts, where Same-Sex Marriage is also legal, has been legally told to include Same-Sex couples in their adoption services or to shut down their operations. Thus, while the Catholic Adoption Services do not ""agree"" with Same-Sex Marriage, they have been forced to either accept it or close down. The right to disagree has been taken away, and this is only one of several cases I have heard of where even non-profit organizations, religious organizations, and business have been fined for not ""agreeing"" with Same-Sex Marriage. Those who believe Same-Sex Marriage is a matter of opinion and should not be forced on all should vote Yes on Proposition 8."
1,"I work as a volunteer at Catholic Adoption Services.  They have not been fined, their operations have not been challenged, and the courts specific ally stated in their decision that no religious organization could be required to act against the mandates of their faith.  Of course, if they refuse to allow otherwise qualified same sex couples to be represented, they may lose their tax exzempt status, but that would require another court ruling.  Please make sure the blogs you go to are reporting factually before you quote them."
1,"How is your right to hold an opinion legally weakened? Are you actually being persecuted under the law for simply holding an opinion?  Or, are you allowed to keep your opinion while you are being forced by law to treat people equally?  I think what you're really trying to say is that your right to force your opinion on others is legally weakened.  Isn't that more appropriate?  Let me ask... Do you believe in Equal Protection under the law?  Or do you believe that some people deserve more protection than others?  Do you believe that there is a chosen class of people who should receive preferential treatement?  Perhaps a class of people who's opinions are so important that they trump the fundamental rights of a lower class of people?  Have the meek really inherited the earth?  Is this really the legacy of Jesus?  When his 'Chosen' people would become the ""Romans"" who stripped the lower class of their humanity?"

1,"By the very statements used to argue against same gender marriages, any heterosexual pair known to be infertile should not be allowed to wed.  Single parents having children of the opposite gender should not be allowed to raise them because they are inherently incapable of teaching the child how to act like a person of that gender.  People who are suspected of being likely to divorce should not be allowed to wed because of the psychological damage it might do to the children.  Very foolish argument.Also, the fact that I am homosexual does not mean I know nothing about having a relationship with a woman.  I fought for decades to live ""in the closet"" and had a very successful relationship until my lady died.  I was not happy, but I concealed it very well.  Then I had my first love relationship natural to me -- one with another man.  I stayed with him, too, until I lost him to a heart attack. I've also raised four children, 2 boys and 1 girl, who have very stable heterosexual relationships and who have all come to me with their mates to discuss problems because they knew I could look at both sides and advise without attacking or being biased.Your reasoning is specious and based upon a total lack of understanding of the capabilities of fully cognizant human beings."
1,"This argument seems to rest on the fact that gay marriage would require different labels for the partners. While I agree that ""Party A"" and ""Party B"" are unromantic and absurdly bureaucratic designations, this seems more like a matter of taste than of fundamental values. ""Cold, contractual"" language? Well, yes. To the extent that marriage is a legal issue, it is in fact a contract - it involves two people making a commitment, in exchange for which they will receive certain rights and benefits. In New York it is possible for a gay couple to enter into such a contract, only they have to call it a domestic partnership rather than a marriage. In theory, this protects their rights, giving them access to the same benefits associated with heterosexual marriage.My question is this: why do we need a legal distinction between marriage and domestic partnership? If domestic partnership truly protects gay rights, the contract should be equivalent to a marriage contract. If this is the case, what is the significance of the label ""marriage?"" If it is a matter of tradition, or taste, or religious preference, it has no place in the law."
1,"If you check the laws, domestic partnerships do NOT offer the same protections as civil marriage.  Domestic partners are not allowed the same health coverage by Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Part D coverage policies for disabled and retired people or under the taxation laws of the United States or most states that have such laws.  The Supreme Court Decision stating that ""Separate but Equal"" is invalid in cases dealing with ethnicity (race, for those who believe there is more than one human race) needs to be expanded to cover all segments of society."
1,I'm not sure why this weak argument was even included.  The heterosexual couple feels that their rights are being infringed upon?  Becuase of the wording on a legal document?  They are still allowed to get married.  What about the rights of the gay couple who wish to marry and won't be able to if this proposition passes?  Who's rights have really been trampled?  Words on a document vs. actual legal rights as a citizen of the U.S.
1,"Its about legal rights...hospital visitation, getting into an ambulance, tax incentives.  These are not the same for domestic partners.  Its exactly like having separate ""but equal"" drinking fountains or restrooms--or sitting in the back of the bus.  Religions don't have to bless these unions, however its up to the government of the people to treat people fairly and bestow the same rights."

1,"""Let's be clear: Jews have been denied civil rights; we aren't looking to deny others anything.  But this is not about legal rights for gay couples.  It is about a threat to religious institutions under the guise of civil rights.""Let me be clear, this is a denial of civil rights, plain and simple, and you are very clearly denying Gays of their right to wed -- you can't honestly debate that fact. Your religion is under no obligation to recognize these people as married, nor will you ever be required to wed these couples, and it does not affect your religion in any way whatsoever. We're not going to regulate or change your religion at all, all we want is for you religion to stop oppressing us and guiding our religious practices.There is no ""guise"" here or whatever you want to call it. Gays are being denied an opportunity everyone else has. I honestly don't care what your religion says, just as you should not care what mine says, but we should both have the right to practice our religions. My religions says it's A-OK for gays to marry one another, yours doesn't.Therefore, don't let gays marry in your church. We'll let gays marry in mine.From the Bill of Rights:""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" We aren't prohibiting your religion from doing anything, so you shouldn't be able to prohibit the exercise of my religion from doing what it feels is right."
1,What a relief to hear that you had at least a twinge of conscience.The fact that Jews have faced discrimination and oppression does not excuse supporting prop 8. How incredibly sad that you've chosen to ally yourselves with forces working to take rights away from others based only on their personal prejudice and their religious beliefs.
1,"To claim that it wasn't easy or bigoted is an insult to the intelligence of the readers here. It was easy. The issue didn't affect you at all, your rights weren't being taken away. All you had to do was vote, and simple as that, someone's value as a human being was diminished.It was bigoted: what exactly isn't bigoted about denying a group the same civil rights you enjoy simply because you don't 'approve'?"
1,"Not being Jewish, I may be a little confused.  I'm aware that the traditional rabbinical treatments of the question deplore the actions involved in homosexuality.  I also seem to recall that, as opposed to the traditional Catholic handling of the matter, the synagogues do not refuse homosexuals the right to attend schul because they feel that (I believe) learning and study are imperative in dealing with sins.  Does this mean that the families of homosexuals are less likely to disown their children?  Will the Jewish community easily accept civil marriage for same gender couples, or are they, in your opinion, deeply averse to such actions?"
1,"Separation of church and state precludes ban on gay marriage. It is not congress's job to decide who anyone can marry.  Marriage could be considered a form of expression, and the First Amendment gives us the right to freely express ourselves.  The First Amendment also states, ""Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or abridging the free exercise thereof"".

1,"There is no way that legalized same-gender marriage would lead to ""discrimination against religion.""  Religious groups have been free to pursue their own beliefs since this nation was founded, even when those beliefs have been odious to the general population.  Churches were among the main proponents of antimiscegenation laws, which prevented people of different races from intermarrying.  When those laws were overturned, churches continued to preach against interracial marriage, and even to refuse to marry interracial couples.  A couple was denied marriage as recently as 2000 because the bride was white and the groom was black.  To my knowledge, no legal action has taken place against the church involved:  http://www.skeptictank.org/wedband.htm    http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-29802943.html  The Roman Catholic Church has been denying holy orders to women and denying marriage to previously divorced persons for their entire existence in this country, and has never been the successful target of a lawsuit or prosecution for these activities.The separation of Church and State is strong enough in this country to protect churches from undue interference from civil legislation which affects other agencies and non-profits.  The problem is that separation of Church and State is suddenly not proving forceful enough to protect innocent citizens from undue influence being exerted by churches to deny those citizens basic civil rights protections."
1,"Discrimination is discrimination and it’s always wrong.  How would the civil rights movement progressed if we had asked the people of Alabama to decide for themselves if they wanted to integrate or not.  The only difference here is the discrimination is not as closely tied to location.  When will we ever learn, civil rights and social transparency benefits everyone.  Discrimination hurts everyone, not just the discriminated, but also the discriminators and society in general.  Gays disproportionately contribute to society.  The sooner they are allowed to fully express themselves, the sooner we will all be better off."

1,"Pacific Justice Institute, are you not familiar with the California Legislative Guide to Marriage Law?  Does the 14th Amendment ring a bell?  Marriage is indeed considered a Fundamental Right under the Constitution of the U.S.  If this is a new concept to you, then perhaps you're overstating your expert status on this matter.  The 'Yes On 8' side has yet to make a valid logical argument as to what harm will come to anyone when two gay people get 'Married'.  Some people have actually stated that they have been harmed because they can't have an opinion on this matter anymore.  Huh?  Some people say that it harms the institution of Marriage.  What?  Marriage is only special because certain people aren't allowed to be married?  Some people say that it infringes on their religious freedom.  They believe the gay lifestyle is immoral, and they might be forced to perform a wedding ceremony for a gay couple.  This is an empty argument.  Immoral people get married in churches every weekend.  Does the church do a complete background check on every couple before it performs a wedding ceremony?  Does it know that the husband to be is a child molester?  Does it know that the wife has slept with the entire high school football team?  Does it know that the money used to pay the church for the wedding was earned by selling meth?  Does it always perform it’s due diligence in these matters?  No, it doesn’t.  The standard is, as long as you appear moral, then you’re ok.  I say, don’t preach a double standard to me.  And don’t use empty, illogical arguments to strip people of their FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS."
1,"""Ms. McBride is technically correct: Prop. 8, by itself, will not require churches to perform gay weddings or schools to teach kindergarteners [sic] about same-sex marriages. Both things, however, are a logical next step.""The constitution protects freedom of religion. The only motivations for banning gay marriage are religious motivations, which shouldn't be applied to all citizens, many of whom do not believe in any religion. In that light, we have no interest in letting religions regulate all of society, and we do not wish to regulate churches.""Nor is it difficult to believe that noted historical figures' alleged homosexuality will make its way into high school history books, even though such figures' sexual proclivities are something that students have absolutely zero need to know.""Actually, it is difficult to believe. Textbooks have to pass wide standards from many different regions which water down the content. Many would find the information objectionable (including myself, because as you say it generally does not relate at all to an historic event), and therefore I don't find no reason national textbook makers would start coming out with editions explicitly stating the sexual preference of a historical figure.""What gays ultimately want is official government approval of their lifestyle.""This is so wrong it's ludicrous. Prop 8 aims to take away rights from gays, and gays are fighting back in order to keep their current EQUALITY, not to gain ""approval."" What a joke of an argument, quite frankly.""If they want to pursue that lifestyle, that's their choice (and make no mistake, it is a choice)""You're right, their lifestyle is their choice. Homosexuality, however, does not appear to be a choice according to most research. They could choose to lead a lifestyle of heterosexuality, but still be homosexual. They cannot simply wish themselves to be straight, nor should we force them to closet themselves and live lifestyles they don't find fulfillment in.If you don't believe me, and you're straight, turn gay right now. Oh, you can't? You're still attracted to the opposite sex? No matter how hard you try you can't turn gay? If it's a choice for them to be straight, it's a choice for us to be as well, and we could change our minds to be gay. I can't turn myself gay, and I think it might be hard for gays to turn straight, because it's not a simple ""choice.""""The government does not have to recognize it, and there is precedent for the government not recognizing relationships other than traditional marriages (polygamous unions, for instance).""Yes, because Polygamy, pedophilia, incest, and homosexuality are all the exact same thing... Honestly, do you even realize the difference between these acts? It seems like your categorization is ""Traditional marriage"" vs ""Everything,"" allowing no difference between the abuse of a child and two gays consenting to a relationship.The reason polygamy between ""consenting"" adults is illegal is because it was a systematized way to abuse women. Although the women might have been ""consenting,"" the whole world in which they were raised favored the men, hurt the women, and taught those disparities as the proper lifestyle. It was hard for women to break out of those oppressive relationships, and outlawing the practice was meant to protect them.Incest, while consensual, has been shown to produce offspring with a higher likelihood of genetic problems. Protecting children.""To keep homosexuals from imposing their way of thinking on the rest of us, Californians should vote yes on Prop. 8.""Are you kidding me? Prop 8 imposes YOUR religious views onto homosexuals, and rejection of Prop 8 is simply the rejection of that inequality.""Both things, however, are a logical next step.""Wrong. This slippery slope argument is so old and tired it's almost hilarious to see it used again and again in your responses. Kids aren't going to be forced to draw rainbows and say nice things about gays, nor will we impose our religious views onto your churches. You're trying to scare people into voting against this, claiming that they're not just voting against Inequality, but that they'll be voting for an overbearing government on their style of life. This is simply ridiculous."

Prop 8 imposes YOUR religious views onto homosexuals, and rejection of Prop 8 is simply the rejection of that inequality.""I would like to add to your criticism.... I would write it this way:""Are you kidding me? Prop 8 imposes YOUR religious views not only on to homosexuals but on to everyone else who does not share your faith. Rejection of Prop 8 is simply the rejection of that inequality"".I am very weary of the self proclaimed righteous in this country telling me how to live my life (and I am straight) just because they have an old book. I am willing to stand up with the gays and lesbians here.  Because if I don't, some day, the self righteous will come after me because I don't have ""faith and compassion"" like they do.People, it is equal rights for all.  Not for some..... for all.  It's simple.  Let God sort it out later.  I betchya he can do that.Michelle"
1,"Freedom of religion does not include the freedom to infringe on the liberties of another. What those who support Proposition 8 wish to keep in place is the right of what amounts to a religious viewpoint to hinder the liberties of those whose views on marriage are different. If, as you say, there are those who would next demand religious institutions perform marriages against their will, I would certainly and just as adamantly oppose their efforts. One cannot rightly demand liberty while at the same time stepping all over the liberties of others to obtain it.Nevertheless, historically, the major religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are far more often the perpetrators of damage to liberties than are other points of view. It has long been their sense of self-righteousness that has led to an assumption they own the cultures in which they find themselves and can therefore dictate the lifestyles of all. They are mistaken and have always been mistaken. Human history is a long story of removing the prejudices of these religions to restore authentic liberty.It is long overdue those philosophies lose their arrogance. Perhaps a little humility would do them good."
1,"Laurie, I fully understand and agree with your point about wanting to be with your spouse when one of you is in the hospital...or when any time of celebration or heartache occurs.  You should be able to file joint income taxes, and to be covered together under insurance policies.  I understand all of that.  I want that for you, too.  I want that for my daughter and her partner, too.  But whether or not your relationship should be called marriage is not something that I and my fellow voters should determine.  That should be determined by your church and mine.  I am weary of government sticking its head into issues which are not the pervue of government.  What I do with my body is between me and my God.  What you and your partner choose to do after you receive a license from the state to be joined in a civil ceremony would be entirely up to you and whatever religious beliefs you follow.  Marriage simply does not fall under the items over which the government has dominion.Over the years, Government has taken a larger and larger bite into our lives, until it seems that they now want to take control of almost everything - how our children are raised and educated, what we can and cannot do about disclipine, and who we can marry.  Both major political parties have lost sight of the intent of our forefathers, who left England to seek a life here free of intrusive government.  You and your partner should never have had this problem in the first place....so there...nanny nanny boo boo."
1,"God can certainly make the decisions in your church.  Unfortunately, he is not in charge of the government.  Remember the phrase ""give that which is Caesar's unto Caesar?""  The government has recognized ""marriages"" as civil unions in the legal system since the beginning.  Unfortunately, we used ""that word"" instead of ""civil unions"" or ""households"" or whatever else you choose to call them.  In order for all people to have equal rights, we either need to change the word ""marriage"" to something like ""civil unions"" in all of the legal documents and laws, or just take the easier route and allow everyone to use the term ""marriage"" in the legal sense.Why can't we allow two different meanings for the same word?  It's not like it has never been done?Michelle"
1,"I agree with you.  I don't want it both ways.  Like I said...the license is the same for everyone...what you do with it is up to you.  Go to a church and get married under the eyes of God.  You have a license for a civil union from the government - not a marriage license.  Your church lets you get married.  The government lets you file taxes as a union...not as a married couple.  Your company lets you buy insurance as a union, not as a couple.  You file a will as a union...not as a couple.  Whatever ceremony you choose to celebrate is up to you.So where do I want cake and to eat, too??????? DUH?  I want the government OUT of my life.  But YOU can't have them in my life about other things...like how I raise MY children.  If I want to spank MY child, it is none of your business.  I was spanked by a wonderful father who NEVER raised a hand to me in anger.  When I had misbehaved, he sent me to my room until he was no longer angry.  Then he came in and talked to me about what I had done wrong.  Then he told me that he had to spank me to make me remember not to do it again.  Then he gave me a    spanking   ...not a beating.  I never had a mark.  Not a red bottom.So I believe he did a good job, and the idea that some knee-jerk reaction from a do-gooder could have me arrested for disciplining my child makes me FURIOUS.  It's not the government's business.  I want the government out of my business.  It doesn't take a village to raise a child.  It takes a family...a whole family, a loving whole family with proper values and a Mom at home to pay attention and a Dad who comes home and pays attention.  It takes FAMILY...not Government...and I want them OUT of my life. "
1," The definition of marriage is fluid and should evolve to include gay marriage - Marriage was, at one point, an institution only for the elite. It was also something that, at one point, was denied to slaves. It evolved from both of these exclusive positions to be more inclusive. There is no reason to believe that the ""institution"" cannnot or should not evolve to also include homosexuals.
"
2,"I know this is a discussion on gay marriage but I felt like I had to jump in here. I am gay and I think I should have the same rights and resposibilities as everyone else. I am also a child protection worker and have some experience as part of the government you rail against. I think you would agree there has to be intervention from our government and society when you see a child that was not merely spanked but beaten, burned and emotionally scared from abuse. What people don't realize is that no one is going to go after them if a child is spanked once in awhile or disciplined harshly. If there was a mark left, then there is a problem. Trust me, no one is going to tell you how to parent your child unless you are hurting your child which is against the law of our land and agreed upon by our society. It is incredibly hard to balance laws and acceptable society norms when investigating child neglect. ""The government"" or child protective services is often caught in the untenable position of ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" when either a child has been found to be severely abused or child protection investigates parents that did nothing wrong. To make matters worse very little information about any case can be released to the public because people have privacy rights as they should. I suppose this will always be an arguement with folks that have had no experience or bad experiences with protective services. The fact is protective services investigates and works with hundreds of thousands of cases a year where families were helped and given resources or kids were saved from further abuse and neglect. I will tell you one thing, I love my job because I get to work with families to make thier lives better and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I am not the monster that wants to steal your children as is often portrayed in the media. I also have been a parent and stood on that line where the three year old pushes you to your limits and you stand there in a haze of anger and you want to hit him. Some people hit him, some people don't and then some people beat him to within an inch of his life or further. There are choices and then there are consequences for those choices. By the way, I am no longer a parent because my kids could only be adopted by one same-sex parent and she took them out of state when we split up. I have no legal recourse. No marriage or civil-union, no parental rights or joint adoptions."
1,"...I just don't want them in my face.  I am capable of doing for myself, thank you very much.  One of the things that   spanking   father taught me was independence.  When I finished college, I was NOT invited home to lounge around while I looked for suitable employment.  I was expected to take whatever was available and make do while I found a better paying, more suitable job in my career field.  But that was then; and children didn't run families - parents did.Meanwhile, back at the issue: I agree with you about the abuse of children - it's rampant.  Having worked with CASA, I am appalled at the flagrant abuse and neglect this generation of drug-using, irresponsible, sleep-around, me-me-me, gimme-another-tattoo-instead-of-paying-my-child-support jerks is perpetrating on their children.  Teenagers having babies without a partner to help raise the child, then discovering that babies are LOTS of trouble.  LOTS of work.  LOTS of responsibility.I don't blame CPS in the least - I blame the media, for spreading the idea that anyone can have a baby - who needs to be married?  If ""Murphy Brown"" can do it, so can I.  And Follywood wondered why Middle America objected so much back when ole Murphy got pregnant.  The little black box which came into our homes took over our lives and our families back when I was a child, and has created a nation of brainwashed people. When the sound of that crying, sick baby needing to be fed and bathed and changed rises above the roar of Jerry Springer, that teenage mother is tempted - very strongly - to hold a pillow over its mouth just so she can hear about the abusive parents on TV."

1,"I agree totally with everything you've said.  Of course, I'm an old gay man who's buried the three loves of his life with no legal standing to protect my interests and families who turned up after the bills were paid to sue in court to throw out my loved ones' wills.  I lost, sad to say.One thing I would like to add is this.  My home dictionary is a 1996 edition of Websters.  ""Marriage"" is defined in it as ""10 the state of being married; wedlock. 2) the act of marrying or the state of being married. 3) close union  .""  The word ""Marry"" is defined as: 1)to take as a husband or wife. 2) to unite in matrimony.  3) to become closely united.""  Since ""husband"" is not gender specific, nor, in English, is ""wife"", the claim that the definition is being changed is poppycock -- just like almost every pro-Prop 8 claim we've heard."
2,"As the push for same-sex marriage continues, I believe that homosexual people will find that they are the recipients of  a great deal of enmity and hostility from other people,  all brought on by their political lobbies – the gay activist organizations.But same sex marriage is not the goal of the gay lobbies.  Their target is nothing less than a program to indoctrinate the public to accept the idea that the homosexual lifestyle is a normal, acceptable  and  desirable alternative to heterosexuality.They’ve already begun.  In April 2006, in Lexington, Mass. a second-grade teacher read a story book to her class about a prince who marries another prince...they even share a kiss.  The irate parents in Lexington tried to get some assistance from the court in their efforts to reject books of this kind from the classroom, but the court turned them down since same-sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts.  We’ll be seeing more of this kind of indoctrination from the gay lobbies."

Attacking homosexuals and bisexuals because of your differing political beliefs has absolutely nothing to do with the core issue. Not every gay couple has an agenda to over run the government. Believe it or not, some homosexuals want to get married because they love each other, just like ""normal"" heterosexual couples."
1,"Yes, because we love each other.  And because we want to be able to protect our children with ALL the same rights of marriage with which straight people are able to to protect their children.  These are CIVIL rights, attached to CIVIL marriage, and were created by society as a safety-net available to citizens of this nation in exchange for making commitments to care for one's spouse and children, thereby relieving society of some of the risk it faces.  Many of the rights and benefits of marriage are specifically for the benefit and protection of children, and many gay families DO have children.  Denial of basic civil rights to such families is a punishment to the children of gay parents simply because of who their parents are.  This is not the kind of society we subscribe to in this country."

You obviously, share the views of the extreme right who has over the years, targeted groups they vehemently opposed!  They took the lead in the 50's and 60's to oppose civil rights for African   Americans  , and when they lost that fight, they moved on and took on those who believed a woman has a right to choose an   abortion   or not. They did everything they could including murdering   doctors   who performed that service as well as demonstrating unlawfully at Planned Parenthood offices and showing unbelievable hatred!  They lost that battle, since every   poll   shows majority of the people support abortion rights including those in Congress.  Now they are taking on gays and lesbians and our supporters!  Of course, they are using the same nasty tactics to gain support and   media   attention to get their message across! You people used to assert years ago that we had ""a hidden gay agenda"" that included corrupting the   children   in our   schools  !  Well that has been so thoroughly discredited by the vast majority of the American people now that it is brought now-except you!One last thing about gay equality my bigoted friend-we are making headway in all parts of the country now although it has not been as fast as I'd wish.  Hopefully, the Congress will finally   vote   in support of ENDA-Employment Non-Discrimination Act which will be a major milestone in the long journey towards equality.

I wish that the gay agenda had the type of corporate dollars, supporters in the White House and other forms of financial and personal resource the conservative Christian agenda funnels to our nation's political system-- as this expert seems to claim.

1," Marriage should be defined around love and commitment, which can include homosexuals If you were to listen to wedding vows, the most fundamental principles expressed are those of the love and commitment shared between the partners. It is the most important foundation of any marriage. Because these principles can be shared between homosexuals, marriage should be allowed between them.

So if the shoe fits...And if it is hateful to disagree with bigots, then I am a hateful person and am reveling in it.I guess attacking a bigot's moral integrity is equal to the hurt that a homosexual person's feels when they are denied the opportunity to marry the partner of their choice because someone who has nothing to do with them doesn't like the idea.We should all be more careful in assuring that bigot's feelings aren't hurt. Sorry. "
2," Higot-according to mothers book of definitions means a person who practices, by choice, the act of   homosexuality   and then blames everything under the sun for their sexuality to the point of abnormal psychology. The higot feels they are deserving of special treatment by the whole of society because they just do,period. A person who does not see tolerance as something they must exhibit but that all others must abide by these cosmic rules;a sense of distorted reality  aka homosexual bigot=higot. A person who will when they are questioned about their sexual choice will deny the ability to choose or willingness to admit they can change. Despite horrendous mounting evidence to the contrary. They will say they are born this way and have no choice but deny the fact that people like Rock Hodson would be alive today since his first choice was a woman. They will question the authenticity of someones homosexuality if they do anything illegal or immoral ie serial rapist/murderers that are homosexual are not true homosexuals according to them. That is quite interesting given the fact they feel that homosexuality cannot be taught or learned but is a birth condition, without any genetic proof ofcourse. While on the other hand teaching homosexuality to   children   in school. Was removing this from a mental disorder the wisest decision. NO. We should, and dare I say must, be careful when it comes to the fact our children are being hurt by this misguided and dangerous sexual movement."
1,"The mother's book of definitions- Where can I buy one? Sounds like it is on par with Oxford dictionary. By your definition from your reputable ""mother's book"" a higot is - ""a person who practices, by choice, the act of   homosexuality  "" - How do you know that it is a choice? I guess you won't believe that homosexuality is a choice, until it is proven."" That is fine, but I hope you don't also try to say that   god   is real, because he/she/it isn't proven either. Also, you claim that a higot - blames everything under the sun for their sexuality to the point of abnormal psychology."" - What? Are you saying that homosexuals think that they have a mental disorder? Later, you say: ""Was removing [sic] homosexuality from a mental disorder the wisest decision. NO."" Because from this, it seems as though YOU think that homosexuality is a mental disorder, not the homosexuals. And I guess then, from your logic about how homosexuality is a choice, I guess all mental disorders are a choice right? ADD? PTSD? Dementia? You then go on to say- ""The higot feels they are deserving of special treatment by the whole of society because they just do,period."" - Um...or maybe they feel that they are deserving of not special, but EQUAL treatment because the Declaration of Independence says ""all men are created equal"" and the 14th amendment guarantees equal protection under the laws of this country. I guess that is the same as ""just because."" Right? Further, you argue that a higot is- ""A person who does not see tolerance as something they must exhibit but that all others must abide by these cosmic rules;a sense of distorted reality aka homosexual bigot=higot."" So... you don't exhibit tolerance to homosexuals...but you think that they, as part of all others, should tolerate/abide by the laws proclaiming the sanctity of heterosexual marriage, protection of your god, etc. Right? - So then, aren't you calling yourself a higot? It seems as though the person suffering from a distorted reality is you. By the way, I know many homosexuals who are more than tolerant that I am a heterosexual female. You also say that a higot is- ""A person who will when they are questioned about their sexual choice will deny the ability to choose or willingness to admit they can change. Despite horrendous mounting evidence to the contrary."" If leading a heterosexual lifestyle is uncomfortable to a homosexual person, why should they change? Forced to live a false life so you can sleep better at night? So they have to lead a life of misery to satisfy your intolerance? Further, would you like to post the links of this ""mounting evidence""? I would like to see the source. Speaking of Rock Hudson you say- ""They will say they are born this way and have no choice but deny the fact that people like Rock Hodson would be alive today since his first choice was a woman""- Were you personal friends with Rock? Did he tell you that his first choice was a woman? Did you ever think that he married a woman to protect his career from bigots like yourself? I suspect that is more likely what happened. You say- ""They will question the authenticity of someones homosexuality if they do anything illegal or immoral ie serial rapist/murderers that are homosexual are not true homosexuals according to them."" - Um...don't ""straight"" men distance themselves from other ""straight"" men who are serial rapists/murderers? That's ok right? ""They feel that homosexuality cannot be taught or learned but is a birth condition, without any genetic proof of course."" - Last time I checked, there is no solid proof of god, so you better not be believing in him either, because there is no solid proof. I am sure even if studies came out proving that homosexuality was genetic, you would find a reason not to believe it, just like   evolution  .You then go on to say- ""teaching homosexuality to   children   in school."" Umm...more like teaching TOLERANCE at school. Tolerance to accept others that are different than you. Maybe you need to go back to school, because you are clearly deficient in this area. You close with: ""We should, and dare I say must, be careful when it comes to the fact our children are being hurt by this misguided and dangerous sexual movement."" - I respond that we should, and dare I say must, be careful when it comes to the fact that our children are being hurt by this misguided and dangerous bigotry.

1,"If marriage between a man and a woman were declared illegal tomorrow.  My wife and I would still be together.  We would know who we are to each other.  We would raise our child together.How then is our union threatened by others also joining into marriage.  Choosing, not because of tradition or expectation or law, but because of the purest purpose and reward of marriage, loving union with your partner.The threat to marriage comes from those wanting to join into its covenant, but rather those ready to declare individuals unfit because of color or faith, station in life or their sexual orientation."
1,"I'm all for same sex couples getting married.  But it's the legal part that I disagree with.  IMHO, the legality of marriage should have nothing to do with government recognition or benefits. Governments should have a concept for Civil Unions for any two people to enter into.  A contract between the couple and the State in essence.  If the government wants to provide benefits, i.e. tax deductions, to people in a union as a result of them having kids, owning property, etc, then do so as encouragement and recognition that stable relationships can benefit the greater good of society (not that single people don't as well.)Marriage then should be, as it has become, a religious institution.  Let each faith in the world decide if they will allow their religious leaders and followers to participate in same sex marriages or not."
1,"""Marriage is, at its heart, a religious concept.""This is factually inaccurate.  Marriage is a cultural construct that transcends religions, whose requirements and structure vary from religion to religion, culture to culture, period to period.Marriage as understood in western society arose from property issues, particularly inheritance for legitimate male offspring.  For a signficant part of Christian history, the Christian church did not participate in marriages.  Marriage in the U.S. is not contingent on having any religious allegiance, nor does it require adherence to the rules and beliefs of one's chosen religion.  The marriage contract in the U.S. is a civil contract, and the clergy's religious role in weddings is ancillary to the civil authority they are granted by the state to recognize the civil contract of marriage."
1,"It seems that the ""sanctity"" of marriage is one of the most common arguments that it needs to be between a man and a woman. It is evident that, especially today, religion generally takes very little role in marriage, regardless of the fact that it sometimes happens in a church."
1,"That two or more people can marry one another emotionally is both unquestionable and unpreventable by others. Those in ""same-sex"" relationships have emotionally married one another likely since our species was identifiable as a distinct species and will likely continue to do so until the species is no more. Those who wish to keep the administrative marriage of same-sex individuals illegal cannot prevent the emotional marriage, nor can they prevent same-sex relationships from both inventively creating offspring and raising them to maturity. One wonders what is actually being accomplished except the irrational and prejudicial exclusion of some individuals from the benefits of administrative recognition of what already exists. What is likely to happen in the continued illegality of same-sex administrative marriage is that these individuals will acquire the same benefits of heterosexual marriages by other means. Life adapts and improvises - or it perishes."
1,"This a great idea and one I agree with completely. The usual objections to homosexual marriage is from a religious point of view, not one of protecting individual rights and liberties. Government recognition of marriage has nothing at all to do with religion and everything to do with social contracts. Turning every existing marriage, at least for legal purposes, into a civil union removes any religious prejudices. It becomes mere legal recognition of a voluntary union of two or more human beings. This last part I say because objections to marriages of more than two individuals are also religiously motivated and has nothing at all to do with legal protections of individual rights.""Sanctity of marriage"" is tribalism that must not be tolerated in a culture that purportedly values individual rights and liberties above all else. Tribalism is socialism is communism is, in any event, contrary to the nature of all life which is to seek its own way in the interest of its own survival and happiness. Civilization merely inserts the proviso that one can have all of that provided one allows the same for others. Marriage traditionalists wish to establish and maintain and members-only club.As I pointed out, they may perhaps prevent recognition of homosexual marriages among themselves, however, homosexuals genuinely desiring marriage to another or others will find a way to do so regardless of irrational barriers to official sanction. In any event, a true marriage is an emotional bond - not an administrative status - of which no one can prevent or dissolve except those involved in the relationship. This is why it is true there are authentic marriages without official sanction and officially sanctioned marriages that are an emotional fraud. Human beings must and, I believe, will progress to a more genuine kind of marriage much less focused if at all on official sanction, i.e., official marriage or even civil union, and more importantly focused on the existence or non-existence of emotional bonding.It is the only kind of marriage that genuinely matters. If it was the way everyone understood marriage, this debate would not be happening."
1," Cementing a definition of marriage as between a man and a woman for tradition's sake is wrong Tradition for tradition's sake is a faulty principle. To say that marriage should be defined as between a man and a woman for tradition's sake is to fall into that trap.

2,"Well, a problem, which there may be more with this idea of making marriage not a legal issue is that of divorce.  The way it is presently setup the government also deals with divorce, but a divorce case could not be settled in court if the marriage was never considered to be legal or at least something that can be considered legal, however I don't mean to convey that it would make it illegal, just that it wouldn't be covered in our laws anymore.  Oh! and another thing is for those who are atheists or simply don't choose to go to church how would that work?  What I mean to say is simply that the idea is going to take a  lot more than just an idea, it'll have to be covered on all bases to even work....however the intent behind the idea, I don't necessarily disagree with it."
2,"Well, I'm not entirely sure what you mean now, but I guess that ""divorce"" would have to also have an alternate name because it deals with the separation of two ""married"" people.  Simply put, what I meant to say was that many laws and specifics of the system would have to be altered, whether severely or not, and I'm not sure how easy it would necessarily be to do....thus, it'd take a lot of work and careful planning... "
2,The definition of marriage is a union and committment between a MAN and a WOMAN.  PERIOD. You don't change definitions because a small vocal minority wants it. I certainly understand same sex people being in love and wanting to spend their remaining days together.  So for insurance and other reasons I would be inclined to agree with some type of civil unions.  But marriage.....NO
1,"The definition of the term ""marriage"" is such because we have arbitrarily defined it that way as an expression of views we have inherited. There doesn't seem to be a justification for this definition in your comment. On your line of reasoning, inter-racial marrying, which was of course legally barred for decades, would automatically be justified. We must challenge these assumptions to see if they hold water today. Considered more systematically however, if you were to go to church and marry without seeking the approval and consent of the state, your marriage wouldn't be legally valid. The inverse, however, isn't true: If you are given a contract by the state to marry without seeking the consent of a religious affiliation your marriage is still valid. My point is that marriage, at its foundation, is granted importance by the state. Therefore, religion aside, why shouldn't consenting adults be allowed to marry whom they choose?  "
1,"I agree the definiton of marriage is between a man and woman but, the word marry means- To join as spouses by exchanging vows, to take as a spouse, to obtain by marriage. My opinion is marriage is to take a spouse, doesnt matter if its same sex or different sex. I can tell you from personal expierence that   same sex marriage   is important for same sex partners but more importantly its important to their   children  . Maybe more so to   kids  ."
1,"No one is redefining the definition of marriage.  Marriage means quite literally the joining of entities - be it buisnesses, ideas, people, elements...etc.  But for the sake of things changing... here are some words that have changed: Commit:  to come together - but now it also means a number of other things.Luxury: originally meant ‘lasciviousness’ or ‘lustCookie: both means   food   and now has tech meaning as wellMouse: animal and techScroll: ancient piece of paper... and how one moves down the screenUndertaker: old meaning entrepreneur, now entrepreneur means small business ownerInspire: to breath life into - now also means to elicit, to move to action etc.Nice: use to mean 'not to know', but now it means something well... nice. :)  good.Bundle of sticks - in the old english - now is a derogatory wordGay: meant happy or merry - so quite litterally when when everyone was happy - it meant everyone was gay. Obviously the meaning has changed.  But in the case of marriage - it is not changing, at least not in the true sense of change as noted above. It still means to come together, to bind, to join, to create a union... etc.  All citizens should have the right to choose their life partner, marry them, and enjoy the benefits of doing so.  "
1,ppl serisouly waste way too much time on issues like this when there are bigger things going on in the world. its so tireing listening to this argument. BOTTOM LINE....why does it matter?!?!? i am a straight female...i love my boyfriend...and i do not care if 2 women or 2 men are in love and want to be married. you cannot stop it...if they are in love and want to be together for the rest of their lives...they will!whats the big deal with making it official by allowing marrige??? who cares!!! i get that religious ppl go by what the bible says....but would you really care if you didnt have your religion to back it up??? its fine that ppl have their beliefs....i respect that. but this issue to me seems like it shouldne even be an issue. times have changed...and ppl continue to change as well.i have relatives along with friends who are gay. and guess what...their just as normal as everyone else i know. i dont see the big deal. ppl feel what they feel and they shouldnt be belittled bc of it
1,"Let me dissect a few points that opponents of gay marriage often bring up:-Gay marriage will lead to more homosexuals by legitimizing the gay lifestyle. A Swedish study published last month showed that gay men and women consistently displayed a brain structure that resembled that of the opposite sex. You see, one of the hemispheres of a woman's brain is slightly bigger than the other, while in men the hemispheres are the same size, which has long been known to be a reliable way to tell apart the sexes physically (besides the really obvious ways) Gay men had brains that resembled a woman's brain and vice versa for lesbian women. This basically proves irrefutably that homosexuality is not a so-called ""lifestyle choice"", but a born-in trait, determined in the womb. -Gay parenting will create screwed up kids by denying them a father or mother figure.  Yes! This is why we, as a society, do not allow single mothers to raise kids. It's just not healthy. I'd do more, but I'm out of room."
1,"""This is why we, as a society, do not allow single mothers to raise kids. It's just not healthy"" how can you say that society doesnt allow single mothers to parent so gays shouldnt either? around 50% of marriages dont last, gay or straight regardless creating single parents. single mothers and fathers raise children all the time with complete sucess and in that situation there is only 1 parent. in a gay marriage there are 2 parenting so it would only create more stability and a better concept of family. im sorry to say that most who are so insecure about any aspects of homosexuality are probably insecure with themselves."
1,"I was raised by my biological mother and her partner. I am no different than anyone else. Nor was I any different than any of my school friends. Which  by the way was ALOT! None of their parents had any problems with it, it did not stop me from doing the same things that the straight parented   kids   did. When my mother died, many of my school friends and their parents attended her funeral, along with BOTH of my ex husbands and their families, including the new wives. My mother being gay did not hurt my   children   either. My mother's partner is still a daily part of our lives and we are the better for it! Get your facts straight. The kids that have issues are the ones raised by parents that dont give a crap about no one but themselves. Out there screwing around,drinking and doing drugs. That is straight and gay parents. Your sexual orientation doesnt make you a bad or good parent, your heart makes that choice."
1,"You can't force anyone to love someone that they don't love. What's the main purpose for marriage? Because you love that person and you want to spend your life with him/her forever. Opposing homosexuality is opposing someone's love for another individual. If a man loves a man but can't marry him because other people basically ""deny their love,"" what could be worse than that?
"
1,"The only reason to not allow same-sex marriage is religious in nature...that is it is an abomination to God. As a Christian myself, I realize that not everyone is Christian and that I have no right to impose my faith on anyone else. Do I agree with the lifestyle? Of course I don't. Religious institutions may refuse to participate or officiate in said ceremonies if they wish, but for goodness sake let people be happy. "
1,"The idea 'homosexuality is sin' is a religious belief, but it is not the only one.  Many people of faith believe, based on the Bible, that homosexuality is not sin.  Further, they believe that labeling the loving intimacy between two people of the same gender as 'an abomination' is not only a false translation of ""toe'vah"", but because it falls in a passage that requires the death penalty, the claim is a overt repudiation of Christ's teachings and a covert death threat.In other words, to many progressive and liberal Christians, 'homosexuality is sin' is incompatible with Christian faith and life.Since there is no such thing as a gay lifestyle, such claims are 'bearing false witness' which is repeatedly forbidden in the Bible.Before posting one's religious views as fact, one should consider that they are, at best, speculation, and often lead one into sin, such as bearing false witness."
1,"The ""parents"" need their freedom too. We're all human beings, animals. We have feelings. It's just a minority of us have feelings for the same sex, but those people should not be deprived of their place in the society. It is not weird for a child to have two parents of the same sex. The parents need to be accepted in this society too. As for the children, if they really do get out of hand with a single parent, we should help them more, shouldn't we? We should teach them if their parents don't. The children feel left out because the society looks at same sex parents as unacceptable people. Just like the parents feel the pain. The best solution to this is to accept same sex lovers as part of our society, not looking down on them or anything, letting them feel accepted, so the children will not have any problems at all."
1,"Sivan claimed ""But same sex marriage is not the goal of the gay lobbies.""So it should be easy for Sivan to provide 25 statements from 'gay lobbies' with external links of course, explicitly stating that same-sex marriage is not the goal'.If Sivan does not or cannot, then Sivan is posting false information, and every claim by Sivan must be interpretted in light of that."
1,"    Where I seem to run into a a problem is the claim that what is wanted most is rights. I have seen the idea of a union of two people with all of the legal rights of a heterosexual community floated only to see it rebuffed because the term ""Civil Union"" was used instead ""Marriage"". Presumedly because it implies acceptance by the broader community. Like it or not you can't legislate acceptance by a community or a religion. Attempts to do so generally result in resentment by both parties."
1,"Aegiltheugly,I believe that all they want is equal rights under the law.  We've seen how ""separate but equal"" worked in the segregated south.  It didn't work.  ""Separate"" can never be ""equal"".I firmly believe that the word marriage can be replaced by union, civil union, or household in legal documents and law.  In fact, that's what we should do.  Then, if you are registered in that status, you have all the financial obligations and rights that only married couples can share in now.  And that includes divorce.Then we could let the churches marry people under their beliefs and procedures. That way, the sacred covenant of marriage would be protected in your church.Would that not satisfy everyone?Michelle"
1,"I appreciate your points, Aegiltheugly, and I could accept the union, civil union, or household designation -- except for one thing.  To yield the point would be to allow the religious right to claim a word out of the English language as belonging solely to them.  According the Websters Dictionary, 1996, marriage is defined as the taking of another person as husband or wife.  It says nothing about a husband taking a wife.  Two women can just as easily take each other as wife, or two men take each other as husband.  I feel it would be wrong to make that sort of concession to any group.  Witness the foolishness of Spike Jones suing Spike TV because they were encroaching on his trademark of his name. "
1,"OddGrouch,You have an excellent point and I now agree with you without reservation.  It must be up to the churches to make their own distinction within their own congregations and doctrine and practice that belief within the confines of their faith. Marriage under the law should be afforded to everyone.  It is a right that we must all have.Michelle"
2,"Two people of the same sex getting married is just two people playing house.  It has nothing to do with hate or discrimination.  It has to do with what is right or wrong.  Allowing gay marriage is just showing that the society is going deeper into moral decay. God is the one that created marriage & it is between one man and one woman anything else apart from that is not of God therefore, cannot be called a marriage.Some people might say God does not judge them well let's clarify that.  While you are alive on this earth in your mortal body God has not yet pass judgment on anyone because he wants everyone to be saved and that means accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior of your life, because after death is the judgment.  Everyone will give have to an account on the type of life they lived here on earth.Does God allow each of us to make our own choices? Yes, but know this every decision you make has consequences.  The Bible said in Revelation 2l verse 8, ""But the cowardly, the unbelieving the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars-their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur.  This is the second death.""  I am not making this up it is already written."
1,"You have no right to tell anyone how to live their lives. Not everyone believes the same way you do. What you are trying to do is impose your religion on everyone else, which is just as immoral as allowing corruption into your religion. If your religion or any other religion does not want to ordain same-sex marriages, fine. But keep religion out of politics and let those who don't believe the same as you live their lives the way they see fit without you interfering with their right to do so. I don't see them interfering with your right to Bible-thump, so don't let them interfere with their right to unbelief if that's what they so desire. "
2,"Reproduction is the main argument for marriage, though not the only one--  If a heterosexual couple chose to only engage in oral sex, would they really need to be married?  Like homosexuality, this behavior would be an abnormal expression of natural love.  But, beyond that why would they need to marry?  Is it that they need a contract of marriage to prove their love for each other? Really?  Do homosexuals argue that they need a contract to prove their non-proliferative (and therefore unnatural) love for each other?

Deny it all you will, but that isn't my opinion.  It's not a belief, it's a fact.  The evidence is all around you and you only don't see it because you close your eyes.  She simply stated her agreement to the Bible, the Bible which is a set of moral statutes that we'd do well to obey if we want to go to Heaven.  If we don't want to, ok, fine, we can do whatever we want to, but it doesn't mean we'll get away from judgment.  Just because we feel it's ok to steal someones chocolate bar, and it's not against our conscience and we feel it's ok, that doesn't make it right.  So don't be all you have religion thus I don't like you to Tamara, she is only posting her thoughts as is the purpose of this site.

1,"1.) Tamara only included a small quote from the Bible. The majority of her input was comprised of interpretation [albeit from her, you, or any minister] of this--and likely other--pieces of scripture. She stated her accordance with a common intrepretation of God's word. There are a great deal of interpretations of scripture, and unfortunately there is not much one can do to clear up misinterpretations considering that all the interpretations are based off of the same text.2.) You cannot use people or the Earth as evidence in support of God if the question at hand is whether or not God created us and the Earth. It may be true [or equally likely false] that God created us and our surroundings, but said evidence is not valid support. Who knows if God created the universe or not... we can never prove such metaphysical conjectures.3.) God may or may not be around [a question I often ask myself], but the Bible was still written by people. Wonderful lessons and words of wisdom, but it's still just a book. God is above and beyond such earthly, material things."
2,"1.) 1 Cor. 6:9 "" 9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?

Plain and simple, not my opinion, nor interpretation, rather it is what it says.2.) So how do you believe the earth (and the universe) was created?  Evolution?  Well if that's the case, look up the second   law   of thermodynamics, it states that everything is moving to disorder, when   evolution   says: bang = life and order.

How could they be in complete agreement with one another? The writing of the Bible spanned thousands of years. There are no contradictions whatsoever in the Bible. But books written by even one person can contradict themselves. How can it be that forty people, most of which didn't even live near the same time, be in complete agreement? "
1,"1.) If a few scholars/linguists agree that ""homosexuals"" is a fair translation of the original text, then you are absolutely right. I don't have enough background in Greek nor in the Bible itself to figure it out. If the translation is accurate [which neither you or I can really know...] then you're absolutely right and this passage does speak against   homosexuality  .2.) What does it matter how I believe the universe was created? I only said that if God created the universe [which He might have] we cannot use our existence as proof of it. I never discredited Creationism. Even if I had, that does not necessarily mean I believe in ""Evolution."" You're quick to assume my beliefs and even quicker to disprove them. Also, the Big Bang and Evolution are two entirely different theories and should be addressed as such.3.) It is not crucial to accept God as an author to understand an argument put forth. That's like saying non-believers are incapable of understanding your ways. An argument should be evaluted for its reasoning, not who said it. There are also more than a few contradictions in the Bible. You'd have a much stronger argument by saying that there aren't many. And I'm sure some groups have 40+ members in complete agreement with each other sometimes. It's not impossible."

The writing of the Bible spanned thousands of years.""-eJonesThe most direct answer is that because the Bible is a compilation of religious texts that they were chosen because they were consistent, and that the different authors had all read the earlier texts and were building on them.

2,"Reproduction provides a stable foundation for the rearing of children. In American society we see more women having children without a male in the household.  Is this by choice of the woman or by design of the man?  We know (statistically), that children in single-mother households have some of the greatest deficits to overcome.  By ignoring the traditional prescription for men ""do the right thing"" and marry a woman that they make pregnant, we see the licentious self-indulgence that punishes children. Homosexuals do not experience this circumstance and cannot claim marriage as a reason to aid children. Social Learning Theory tells us that adoptive homosexual parents will likely increase the number of children entering a lifestyle that produces significant medical pathologies because of the behavior of the participants.  This would simply be child abuse.

1,"As long as marriage is used contractually by society as a means of determining who is or is not eligible to receive governmental benefits, rights or protections, there can be no legitimate reason to limit it to only heterosexual participants, based upon religious strictures and dictates.  Churches should have the absolute right to determine who is or is not eligible to receive any of their sacraments or blessings, and may discriminate at will based upon whatever criteria they set for themselves, but government has no such leeway.  If heterosexuals continue to want their government to acknowledge their marriages and dispense rights and protections based upon those marriages, then such acknowledgement must be open and available to ALL citizens, regardless of sexual orientation.The fact that we currently have a situation in which sacramental blessings of marriage and governmental verification of civil marriage are dispensed at the same moment by the same officiant, should in no way cause us to confuse the two separate and distinct institutions.  If we need to rename one of these institutions ""civil unions"" and provide such civil unions to all couples who seek governmental acknowledgment of their relationships, regardless of the gender of the participants, and leave the other term, ""marriage"" as a purely religious concept to be granted at will by various religious institutions, then so be it.  It would probably be easier, on the whole, though, for us all to just grow up and realize that the two institutions exist side-by-side and, while we may be able to control the one (sacramental), there is no good reason to deny the other (civil) to any of our fellow citizens based upon our personal religious beliefs."
1,"So... I'm going to assume that you are vehemently against transexual people as well then? Ok, so you've quoted the   bible   at me, I'm assuming. I'd like to quote back. John 3:16For God so loved the world he sent his only begotten son, that WHOSOEVER (hate to break it to you, that does include gay people) believes in him, shall not perish but have everlasting life. For the sake of arguement, let's say that a gay   christian   couple wants to get married, because they want to have sex after they get married, not before. Wouldn't that mean they are following what God is   teaching  ? Also, please point out versus where the Bible says being gay is wrong. Or how about John 8, 1-11? Let anyone among you who is without sin throw the first stone. There's also the issue of love. If I remember correctly, love is the word used most in the bible. Gay couples love each other, and they deserve to be loved. And the hate the sinner thing? It's like saying you don't like people being left handed, but you like left handed people. Being gay isn't a choice, whatever you may think of it, it's a piece of your brain that's hard wired into you, like being straight. "
2,"To Bagpipe2005It is impossible to separate religion from politics and this is why, whether you like it or not, or whether you are a Christian or not God is the one who created laws and how we as human beings should live in a society.  The 10 commandments is the very basis of almost every county's law in the world today.For example thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal, thou shall not commit fornication etc. And from these laws spring forth other laws.So when people say separate religion from politics that is not a valid argument.  God's standard  will always be the best way, anything from that is lawless. So you not loving God or don't care anything about Him does not change anything. You have your opinion and I have my truth.  Peace"
1,"...our kids that earth is 6,000 years old in school? Hey, you can't separate religion from politics, right? Of course, I feel sorry for anyone who believes that nonsense. By the way, I'm very deeply rooted in the Christian faith. I have a very strong faith in Christianity, but I do not force that faith on others and I let people live the way they see fit and love the people they want to love. Adultery is perfectly legal in this nation, as is lying, coveteousness, and not attending church, so your theory of the 10 Commandments being the basis for law is out the window. A majority of the founding fathers of this nation were actually non-Christians anyway (most of them were Deists). ""God's standard"" might be the best way, but we can't hold everyone to that standard, as such we would be oppressing minorities. To make everyone commit to Christian values against their will is truly disgusting, people just want to be free to live their lives. "
1,"Wow, bagpiper2005, every time I want to reply to a post you beat me to the punch and convey your opinions intelligently as well as passionately- kudos to you.It I've read various posts for and against this subject and it seems as though the only people who are against it straightforwardly are those who come across as Fundamentalist Christians who can't seem to adapt very well to the changing times. In fact, after reading the primary article we are all debating on, my first impression was: ""so... we shouldn't adapt- because 'that's the way things have always been- why change it?' how lame is that?"" I mean, we've adapted so much as humans- all different cultures- we wouldn't have   technology   if we had maintained that mindset.I also have deep rooted Christian beliefs- I'm 22, saving for   marriage  , (though I refuse to marry until everyone in my country is granted that right- guess I'll be a virgin for a long time, hahaha) and I have a lot of strong Christian beliefs- however, bagpiper2005, I agree that my personal beliefs should not prohibit anyone from loving whoever makes them happy- and marriage may be somewhat of a farce as of late (Celebrities are making marriage into a fad, it seems, what with the constant divorce rates and all that lovely jazz), but when I think of 'marriage' I think of happy people committing to loving one another for the rest of their lives- and the prospect of this right being denied to anyone makes me scoff.When I was 12 years old, and a goody-two shoes Christian freak, and I was first presented with the prospect of homosexual marriage (by my super religious aunt) I was so puzzled and confused by the contradictory feelings I had regarding the topic- knowing that, per my aunt, 'and the   bible  - supposedly' God doesn't love 'fags' yet God is a God of love- yeah, you can see where my brain just exploded for a while, there...So all the Fundamentalist Christian hubbub- regardless of the 'grounded evidence' presented in the bible- is just mind-blowingly asinine- even a twelve year old can see it."
1,"Tamara,I think you would do well to to read about the actual writing of the US constitution and the bill of rights as well as the debates over religion and state laws that took place in Virginia prior to our founding documents. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson were very clear about what they thought should be the founding principles of this country.Besides, not kill and not steal are pretty universal laws, they even existed before Moses received the stones they were written on.

1,"If you want to drag   religion   into this, fine. Here's a challenge, make a case against gay marriage that does not include religion, reproduction issues, ethics or anything stated here. My point is that as soon as this debate comes up, the first thing to be said is ""well the   bible   says..."" or ""gay men or women cant reproduce"". Oh, and you said ""You have your opinion and I have my truth"" well, that's an opinion. Your opinion is that you're right when it comes to religion. my opinion is that you're bring arrogant, close minded, and flat out rude."
